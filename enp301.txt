OverviewEco-driving

Eco-driving is a range of everyday practices that allow the motorist to optimise their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

Optimise the use of your 
gearbox
With a manual gearbox, move off gently, 
change up without waiting and drive by 
changing up quite soon.

With an automatic or electronic gearbox, stay 
in Drive D or Auto A, according to the type 
of gearbox, without pressing the accelerator 
pedal heavily or suddenly.

The gear efficiency indicator invites you to 
engage the most suitable gear: as soon as the 
indication is displayed in the instrument panel, 
follow it straight away.
For vehicles fitted with an electronic or 
automatic gearbox, this indicator appears only 
in manual mode.

Drive smoothly

Maintain a safe distance between vehicles, 
use engine braking rather than the 
brake pedal, and press the accelerator 
progressively. These practices contribute 
towards a reduction in fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions and also help to reduce the 
background traffic noise.

If your vehicle has cruise control, make use of 
the system at speeds above 25 mph (40 km/h) 
when the traffic is flowing well.

Control the use of your electrical 
equipment
Before moving off, if the passenger 
compartment is too warm, ventilate it by 
opening the windows and air vents before 
using the air conditioning.
Above 30 mph (50 km/h), close the windows 
and open the air vents.
Remember to make use of equipment that can 
help keep the temperature in the passenger 
compartment down (window blinds, etc.).

Switch off the air conditioning as soon as the 
desired temperature is attained.
Switch off the demisting and defrosting 
controls, if not automatic.
Switch off the heated seat as soon as 
possible.

Switch off the headlamps and fog lamp when 
the level of light does not require their use.

Avoid running the engine before moving off, 
particularly in winter; your vehicle will warm up 
much faster while driving.

As a passenger, if you avoid connecting your 
multimedia devices (film, music, video game 
etc.), you will contribute towards limiting the 
consumption of electrical energy, and so of 
fuel.
Disconnect your portable devices before 
leaving the vehicle.

9

.Eco-drivingLimit the causes of excess 
consumption
Spread loads throughout the vehicle; place 
the heaviest items in the bottom of the boot, 
as close as possible to the rear seats.
Limit the loads carried in the vehicle and 
reduce wind resistance (roof bars, roof rack, 
bicycle carrier, trailer...). Preferably use a roof 
box.
Remove roof bars and roof racks after use.

Observe the recommendations 
on maintenance
Check the tyre pressures regularly, when cold, 
referring to the label in the door aperture, 
driver's side.
Carry out this check in particular:
- 
- 
- 
Don't forget the spare wheel and the tyres on 
any trailer or caravan.

before a long journey,
at each change of season,
after a long period out of use.

At the end of winter, remove snow tyres and 
refit your summer tyres.

Have your vehicle serviced regularly (engine 
oil, oil filter, air filter, etc.) and observe the 
schedule of operations recommended by the 
manufacturer.

When filling the tank, do not continue after the 
3rd cut-off of the nozzle to avoid overflow.

At the wheel of your new vehicle, it is only 
after the first 1,800 miles (3,000 kilometres) 
that you will see the fuel consumption settle 
down to a consistent average.

1InstrumentsWarning lights
When the ignition is switched on
Certain warning lights come on for a few 
seconds when the vehicle's ignition is switched 
on.
When the engine is started, these same 
warning lights should go off.
If they remain on, before moving off refer to the 
information on the warning light concerned.

Associated warnings
Certain warning lights may come on in one of 
two modes: fixed (continuous) or flashing.
Only by relating the type of lighting to the 
operating status of the vehicle can it be 
ascertained whether the situation is normal or 
whether a fault has occurred.
In the event of a fault, the illumination of the 
warning light may be accompanied by an 
audible signal and/or a message.

12

Warning lights
When the engine is running or the vehicle is 
being driven, illumination of one of the following 
warning lights indicates a fault which requires 
action on the part of the driver.
Any fault resulting in the illumination of a 
warning lamp must be investigated further 
using the associated message.
If you encounter any problems, contact a 
PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop.

Operation indicator lights
If one of the following indicator lights comes on 
in the instrument panel and/or instrument panel 
screen, this confirms that the corresponding 
system has come into operation.

Deactivation indicator lights
If one of the following indicator lights comes 
on, this confirms that the corresponding system 
has been switched off intentionally.
This may be accompanied by an audible signal 
and a message being displayed.

manufacturer's servicing schedule.

The point at which the service is due is 
calculated from the last reset of the service 
indicator, according to the mileage covered and 
the time elapsed since the last service.

For BlueHDi Diesel versions, the degree 
of deterioration of the engine oil is also 
taken into account (depending on the 
country of sale).

when the ignition is switched on.

26

To do so, follow this procedure:
F  Switch off the ignition.
F  Press the trip distance recorder reset 

button and keep it pressed.

F  Switch on the ignition; the distance 

recorder display begins a countdown.

F  When the display indicates =0, release the 

button; the spanner disappears.

Following this step, if you wish to 
disconnect the battery, lock the vehicle 
and wait at least five minutes for the reset 
to be taken into account.

The remaining mileage may be weighted 
by time according to the driver’s driving 
habits.
The spanner may therefore also come 
on if you have exceeded the period 
since the last service, as indicated in the 
manufacturer's service schedule.
For BlueHDi Diesel versions, the spanner 
may also come on early, depending on the 
degree of deterioration of the engine oil 
(depending on the country of sale).
The degree of deterioration of the engine 
oil depends on the driving conditions in 
which the vehicle is used.

InstrumentsAdBlue® liquid range indicators

Once the AdBlue® tank is on reserve or after 
detection of a fault with the SCR emissions 
control system, when the ignition is switched 
on, an indicator displays an estimate of the 
distance that can be covered, the range, before 
engine starting is prevented.
In the event of simultaneous system fault and 
low AdBlue® level, the shortest range figure is 
the one displayed.

Range greater than 1,500 miles (2,400 km)
When switching on the ignition, there is no 
automatic display of range in the instrument 
panel.

The engine start prevention system 
required by regulations is activated 
automatically once the AdBlue® tank is 
empty.

When switching on the ignition, the AdBlue 
warning light comes on, accompanied by 
an audible signal and the temporary display 
of "NO START IN" and a distance on the 
instrument panel, indicating the remaining 
range expressed in miles or kilometres before 
engine starting is prevented - (e.g. "NO START 
IN 1500 km" means "Starting will be prevented 
in 1,500 km (930 miles).
When driving, this message is displayed every 
186 miles (300 km) until the AdBlue level has 
been topped-up.®
The reserve level has been reached: it is 
recommended that you top-up as soon as 
possible.
It is recommended that you not top up by more

The AdBlue, Service and engine diagnostic 
warning lights come on, accompanied by an 
audible signal and the display of the message 
"Emissions fault".
The alert is triggered when driving when the 
fault is detected for the first time, then when 
switching on the ignition for subsequent 
journeys, while the fault persists.

If it is a temporary fault, the alert 
disappears during the next journey, 
after self-diagnosis of the emissions 
SCRsystem.

If a fault with the SCR system is confirmed 
(after 30 miles (50 km) covered with the 
permanent display of the message signalling 
a fault), the Service and engine diagnostic 
warning lights come on and the AdBlue warning 
light flashes, accompanied by an audible signal 
and the temporary display in the instrument 
cluster of "NO START IN" and a distance, 
indicating the remaining range expressed in 
miles or kilometres before engine starting 
is prevented - (e.g.: "NO START IN 600 km" 
means "Starting will be prevented in 600 km 
(350 miles)").
While driving, this display appears every  
30 seconds while the fault with the emissions 
SCR system persists.
The alert is repeated when switching on the 
ignition.
You should go to a PEUGEOT dealer or a 
qualified workshop as soon as possible.
Otherwise, you will not be able to restart the

58

Ease of use and comfortRecommendations for heating, ventilation and air conditioning

In order for these systems to be fully 
effective, follow the operation and 
maintenance guidelines below :
F  To ensure that the air is distributed 
evenly, keep the external air intake 
grilles at the base of the windscreen, the 
nozzles, the vents, the air outlets and 
the air extractor located in the back free 
from obstructions.

F  Operate the air conditioning system for 
at least 5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a 
month to keep it in perfect working order.
F  Ensure that the passenger compartment 

filter is in good condition and have the 
filter elements replaced regularly.

We recommend the use of a combined 
passenger compartment filter. Thanks to 
its special active additive, it contributes 
to the purification of the air breathed by 
the occupants and the cleanliness of the 
passenger compartment (reduction of 
allergic symptoms, bad odours and greasy 
deposits).
F  To ensure the correct operation of the 
air conditioning system, you are also 
advised to have it checked regularly 
as recommended in the warranty and 
maintenance record.
If the system does not produce cold air, 
switch it off and contact a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

F 

When towing the maximum load on a steep 
gradient in high temperatures, switching off 
the air conditioning increases the available 
engine power and so improves the towing 
ability.

If after an extended stop in sunshine, 
the interior temperature is very 
high, first ventilate the passenger 
compartment for a few moments.
Put the air flow control at a setting high 
enough to quickly change the air in the 
passenger compartment.
The air conditioning system does not 
contain chlorine and does not present 
any danger to the ozone layer.

The condensation created by the air 
conditioning results in a discharge of 
water under the vehicle which is perfectly 
normal.

Stop & Start
The heating and air conditioning systems 
only work when the engine is running.
To maintain a comfortable temperature 
in the passenger compartment, you can 
temporarily deactivate the Stop & Start 
system.
For more information on Stop & Start, 
refer to the corresponding section.

5SafetyTyre under-inflation detection

System which automatically checks the 
pressures of the tyres while driving.
The system monitors the pressures in the four 
tyres, once the vehicle is moving.
It compares the information given by the four 
wheel speed sensors with reference values, 
which must be reinitialised every time the 
tyre pressures are adjusted or a wheel 
changed.
The system triggers an alert as soon as it 
detects a drop in the inflation pressure of one 
or more tyres.

The under-inflation detection system does 
not replace the need for vigilance on the 
part of the driver.
This system does not avoid the need to 
check the tyre pressures (including the 
spare wheel) every month as well as 
before a long journey.
Driving with under-inflated tyres worsens 
road-holding, lengthens braking distances, 
causes premature wear of the tyres, 
particularly in adverse conditions (heavy 
loads, high speeds, long journeys).

74

Driving with under-inflated tyres 
increases fuel consumption.

The inflation pressures defined for your 
vehicle can be found on the tyre pressure 
label.
For more information on the 
Identification markings, refer to the 
corresponding section.

Checking tyre pressures
This check should be done when the tyres 
are "cold" (vehicle stopped for 1 hour or 
after a journey of less than 6 miles (10 km) 
at moderate speeds).
Otherwise, add 0.3 bar to the pressures 
shown on the label.

Under-inflation alert

This warning is indicated by 
continuous illumination of the light, 
an audible signal and a message 
displayed on the screen.

F  Reduce speed immediately, avoid 

excessive steering movements and sudden 
braking.

F  Stop as soon as it is safe to do so.

The loss of pressure detected does not 
always cause visible bulging of the tyre. 
Do not rely on a simple visual check.

F 

or
F 

If you have a compressor (such as the 
one in the temporary puncture repair kit), 
check the pressures of the four tyres when 
cold. If it is not possible to make this check 
immediately, drive carefully at reduced 
speed. 

In the event of a puncture, use the 
temporary puncture repair kit or the spare 
wheel (depending on equipment).

The warning remains active until the 
system is reinitialised.

SafetyReinitialisation
It is necessary to reinitialise the system every 
time one or more tyre pressures are adjusted, 
and after changing one or more wheels.

Without audio system
F  Open the glove box.

With audio system

Before reinitialising the system, ensure 
that the pressures of the four tyres are 
correct for the use of the vehicle and in 
line with the recommendations on the tyre 
pressure label.
The under-inflation alert can only 
be relied on if the system has been 
reinitialised with all four tyres inflated to 
the correct pressures.
The under-inflation detection system 
does not give a warning if a pressure is 
incorrect at the time of reinitialisation.

F  Hold this button down.
Reinitialisation is confirmed by a low-pitched 
audible signal.
A high-pitched audible signal indicates that the 
reinitialisation has not been done.

The new pressure parameters saved are 
considered by the system as values of 
reference.

SafetyElectronic stability programme (ESC)

Electronic Stability Programming including the 
following systems:
- 

anti-lock braking system (ABS) and 
electronic brake force distribution (EBFD),
emergency braking assistance (EBA),

- 
-  wheel anti-slip regulation (ASR) or traction 

control,
dynamic stability control (DSC).

- 

Definitions
Anti-lock braking system (ABS) 
and electronic brake force 
distribution (EBFD)
These systems improve the stability and 
manoeuvrability of your vehicle when braking 
and contribute towards improved control in 
corners, in particular on poor or slippery road 
surfaces.
The ABS prevents wheel lock in the event of 
emergency braking.
The electronic brake force distribution system 
manages the braking pressure wheel by wheel.

Emergency braking assistance

In an emergency, this system enables you to 
reach the optimum braking pressure more 
quickly and therefore reduce the stopping 
distance.
It is triggered in relation to the speed at which 
the brake pedal is pressed. The effect of this is 
a reduction in the resistance of the pedal and 
an increase in braking efficiency.

Anti-slip regulation (ASR)
This system optimises traction in order to 
avoid wheel slip by acting on the brakes of 
the driving wheels and on the engine. It also 
improves the directional stability of the vehicle 
on acceleration.

Dynamic stability control (DSC)

If there is a difference between the path 
followed by the vehicle and that required by the 
driver, this system monitors each wheel and 
automatically acts on the brake of one or more 
wheels and on the engine to return the vehicle 
to the required path, within the limits of the laws 
of physics.

Anti-lock braking system 
(ABS) and electronic brake 
force distribution (EBFD)

The fixed illumination of this warning 
lamp signals that there is a fault with 
the ABS.

The vehicle retains conventional braking. Drive 
carefully at moderate speed.
Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop as soon as possible.

Illumination of this warning lamp, 
coupled with the STOP and ABS 
warning lamps, accompanied by 
the display of a message and an 
audible signal, signals that there is a 
fault with the electronic brake force 
distribution (EBFD).

You must stop as soon as it is safe to do so.
Call on a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

77

5SafetyAnti-slip regulation (ASR) / Dynamic stability control (DSC)

Normal operation of the ABS may make 
itself felt by slight vibrations of the brake 
pedal.

In emergency braking, press very 
firmly and maintain this pressure.

Operation
These systems are activated automatically 
every time the vehicle is started.
They come into operation in the event of a 
problem of grip or trajectory.

This is indicated by this warning light 
flashing in the instrument panel.

When changing wheels (tyres and rims), 
ensure that these are approved for your 
vehicle.

78

Deactivation
In exceptional conditions (starting a vehicle 
which is bogged down, stuck in snow, on soft 
ground...), it may be advisable to deactivate the 
ASR system, so that the wheels can turn freely 
and regain grip.
Reactivate the system when grip conditions 
allow.

F  Press this button, located on 

the lower left of the dashboard 
(driver's side), until the 
corresponding symbol appears 
in the instrument panel screen.

The button indicator light comes on.
The ASR system no longer acts on the 
operation of the engine.

SafetyReactivation
The ASR system is reactivated automatically 
every time the ignition is switched back on or 
from 30 mph (50 km/h).
Below 30 mph (50 km/h), you can reactivate it 
manually.

F  Press this button again to 

reactivate the system manually.

The button indicator light goes off.

Operating fault

Illumination of this warning lamp, 
accompanied by the display of a 
message and an audible signal, 
indicates a fault with the system.

Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the systems checked.

ASR / DSC

These systems offer increased safety 
in normal driving, but they should not 
encourage the driver to take extra risks or 
drive at high speed.
It is in conditions of reduced grip (rain, 
snow, black ice) that the risk of loss of grip 
increases. For your safety, you should 
therefore keep these systems activated at 
all times, particularly in poor conditions.
The correct operation of these 
systems depends on observation of 
the manufacturer's recommendations 
regarding both the wheels (tyres and 
rims), braking and electronic components 
and the assembly and repair procedures 
used by PEUGEOT dealers.
In order to benefit from the efficiency of 
these systems in winter conditions, we 
recommend using snow tyres.
In this case, it is essential to equip the 
four wheels with tyres approved for your 
vehicle.

buckle.

F  Check that the seat belt is fastened 

correctly by pulling the strap.

Unlocking

F  Press the red button on the buckle.
F  Guide the seat belt as it reels in.

The front seat belts are fitted with a pyrotechnic 
pretensioning and force limiting system.

This system improves safety in the front 
seats in the event of a front or side impact. 
Depending on the severity of the impact, the 
pretensioning system instantly tightens the seat 
belts against the body of the occupants.
The pretensioning seat belts are active when 
the ignition is on.
The force limiter reduces the pressure of the 
seat belt on the chest of the occupant, thus 
improving their protection.

Seat belt not fastened / 
unfastening warning light

When the ignition is switched on, 
this warning light comes on in the 
instrument panel, if the driver has 
not fastened his/her seat belt.

From approximately 12 mph (20 km/h), 
this warning light flashes for two minutes 
accompanied by an audible signal of increasing 
volume. Once these two minutes have elapsed, 
this warning light remains on until the driver 
fastens their seat belt.
This warning lamp also illuminates in the 
instrument panel if the driver and/or front 
passenger unfastens his/her seat belt while 
driving.*

*  Depending on the country of sale.

SafetyRear seat belts

The right and left rear seats are each fitted with 
a three-point inertia reel seat belt.

81

5SafetyAdvice

The driver must ensure that passengers use 
the seat belts correctly and that they are all 
fastened before setting off.
Wherever you are seated in the vehicle, 
always fasten your seat belt, even for short 
journeys.
Do not interchange the seat belt buckles as 
they will not completely fulfil their role.
The safety belts are equipped with an 
inertia reel which allows the strap length to 
automatically adjust to your shape. The seat 
belt returns to its storage automatically when 
it is not used.
Before and after use, ensure that the seat 
belt is reeled in correctly.
The lower part of the strap must be 
positioned as low as possible on the pelvis.
The upper part must be positioned in the 
hollow of the shoulder.
The inertia reels are fitted with a device 
which automatically locks the strap in the 
event of a collision or emergency braking or 
if the vehicle rolls over. You can release the 
device by pulling the strap firmly and then 
releasing it so that it reels in slightly.

In order to be effective, a seat belt:
-  Must be tightened as close to the body 

as possible,

-  Must be pulled in front of you with a 

smooth movement, ensuring that it is not 
twisted,

-  Must only be used to secure one person,
-  Must not show signs of tear or fraying.
-  Must not be changed or modified, in 

order to avoid affecting its performance.

In accordance with current safety 
regulations, for all repairs on your vehicle's 
seat belts, go to a qualified workshop 
provider with the skills and equipment 
needed, which a PEUGEOT network is able 
to provide.
Have your seat belts checked regularly by 
the network PEUGEOT or someone qualified 
workshop, particularly if the straps show 
signs of damage.
Clean the seat belt straps with soapy 
water or a textile cleaning product, sold by 
PEUGEOT dealers.
After folding or moving a seat or rear bench 
seat, ensure that the seat belt is positioned 
and reeled in correctly.

Recommendations for children
Use a suitable child seat if the passenger is 
less than 12 years old or shorter than one 
and a half metres.
Never use the same seat belt to secure more 
than one person.
Never allow a child to travel on your lap.
For more information on Child seats, refer to 
the corresponding section.

In the event of an impact
Depending on the nature and seriousness 
of the impacts, the pyrotechnic device 
may trigger before and independently of 
airbag deployment. Deployment of the 
pretensioners is accompanied by a slight 
discharge of harmless smoke and a noise, 
due to the activation of the pyrotechnic 
cartridge incorporated in the system.
In all cases, the airbag warning light is on.
After an impact, get the seat belt system 
checked and if necessary have it replaced 
by the network PEUGEOT or by qualified 
workshop.

82

SafetyAir bags

Designed to contribute to the safety of the 
occupants in case of violent collisions The 
airbags supplement the action of the force-
limiting seat belts.
If a collision occurs, the electronic detectors 
record and analyse the front and side impacts 
sustained in the impact detection zones:
In the event of violent impact, the air 
- 
bags are deployed instantly and help 
better protect occupants of the vehicle; 
immediately after the impact, the air 
bags deflate rapidly in order not to hinder 
the visibility nor the possible exit of the 
occupants.
In the event of a non violent impact, impact 
on the back and under certain conditions of 
a rollover, the air bags may not deploy; only 
the seat belt helps to protect you in these 
situations.

- 

The air bags do not operate when the 
ignition is switched off.
This equipment will only deploy once. If a 
second impact occurs (during the same or 
a subsequent accident), the airbag will not 
be deployed again.

Impact detection zones

Front air bags

System which protects the driver and front 
passenger in the event of a serious front impact 
in order to limit the risk of injury to the head and 
thorax.
The driver's air bag is fitted in the centre of the 
steering wheel; the front passenger's air bag is 
fitted in the dashboard above the glove box.

A
B

Front impact zone.
Side impact zone.

The deployment of an air bag is 
accompanied by a slight emission of 
smoke and a noise, due to the detonation 
of the pyrotechnic charge incorporated in 
the system.
This smoke is not harmful, but sensitive 
individuals may experience slight irritation.
The detonation noise associated with the 
deployment of an air bag may result in a 
slight loss of hearing for a short time.

83

5SafetyDeployment

Deactivation
Only the passenger's front air bag can be 
deactivated.

The air bags are deployed, except the 
passenger's front air bag if it has been 
deactivated, in the event of a serious front 
impact to all or part of the front impact zone A, 
in the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle on a 
horizontal plane and directed from the front to 
the rear of the vehicle.
The front air bag inflates between the thorax 
and head of the front occupant of the vehicle 
and the steering wheel, driver's side, and the 
dashboard, passenger's side, to cushion their 
forward movement.

F  With the ignition off, insert the key into 
the passenger air bag deactivation switch.

F  Turn it to the "OFF" position.
F  Remove the key keeping the switch in this 

position.

When the ignition is on, this warning 
light comes on in the instrument 
panel and stays on while the air bag 
is deactivated.

84

To assure the safety of your child, 
the passenger's front air bag must be 
deactivated when you install a "rearward 
facing" child seat on the front passenger 
seat. Otherwise, the child risks being 
seriously injured or killed if the air bag is 
deployed.

Reactivation
When you remove the rearward facing child 
seat, with the ignition off, turn the switch to 
the ON position to reactivate the air bag and so 
assure the safety of your front passenger in the 
event of an impact.

Malfunction

If this warning light comes on in the 
instrument panel, you must contact 
a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system 
checked. The air bags may no 
longer be deployed in the event of a 
serious impact.

SafetySide air bags

Deployment

System that contributes towards improving the 
protection of the driver and front passenger in 
the event of a serious side impact, in order to 
limit the risk of injury to the chest, between the 
hip and the shoulder.
Each side air bag is fitted in the seat backrest 
frame, door side.

They are deployed unilaterally in the event 
of a serious side impact applied to all or part 
of the side impact zone B, perpendicular to 
the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle on a 
horizontal plane and directed from the outside 
towards the inside of the vehicle.
The side air bag contributes towards the 
protection of the front occupant of the vehicle, 
between the lower thorax and the head.

Malfunction

If this warning light comes on in the 
instrument panel, you must contact 
a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system 
checked. The air bags may no 
longer be deployed in the event of a 
serious impact.

In the event of a minor impact or bump on 
the side of the vehicle or if the vehicle rolls 
over, the air bag may not be deployed.
In the event of a rear or front collision, the 
air bag is not deployed.

85

5SafetyAdvice

For the air bags to be fully effective, observe the safety recommendations below.

Front air bags
Do not drive holding the steering wheel by its 
spokes or resting your hands on the centre 
part of the wheel.
Passengers must not place their feet on the 
dashboard.
Do not smoke as deployment of the air bags 
can cause burns or the risk of injury from a 
cigarette or pipe.
Never remove or pierce the steering wheel or 
hit it violently.
Do not fasten or attach anything to the 
steering wheel or dashboard, this could 
cause injuries with deployment of the air 
bags.

Adopt a normal and upright sitting position.
Fasten your seat belt, ensuring it is 
positioned correctly.
Do not leave anything between the 
occupants and the air bags (a child, pet, 
object...), nor fix or attach anything close to 
the inflation trajectory of the air bags; this 
could cause injuries during their deployment.
Never modify the original definition of your 
vehicle, particularly in the area directly 
around the air bags.
After an accident or if the vehicle has been 
stolen or broken into, have the air bag 
systems checked.
All work on the air bag system must be 
carried out by a PEUGEOT dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
Even when following all the precautions 
listed, a risk of injuries or slight burns to 
the head, the chest or the arms, when an 
air bag deploys cannot be excluded. The 
bag inflates almost instantly (within a few 
milliseconds) then deflates within the same 
time discharging the hot gas via openings 
provided for this purpose.

Side air bags
Use only approved covers on the seats, 
compatible with the deployment of the side 
air bags. For information on the range of 
covers suitable for your vehicle, you can 
contact a dealer PEUGEOT.
Do not attach anything to or hang anything 
from the seat backrests (clothes, etc.) as 
this could cause injuries to the thorax or arm 
when the side air bag is deployed.
Do not sit with the upper part of the body any 
nearer to the door than necessary.

The vehicle's front door panels include side 
impact sensors.
A damaged door or any unauthorised or 
incorrectly executed work (modification or 
repair) on the front doors or their interior trim 
could compromise the operation of these 
sensors - Risk of malfunction of the side air 
bags!
Such work must only be done by a 
PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop.

86

SafetyGeneral points relating to child seats

PEUGEOT recommends that children 
should travel in the outer rear seats of 
your vehicle:
-  Rearward facing up to the age of 3.
- 

Forward facing from the age of 3.

Although one of PEUGEOT's main 
considerations when designing your vehicle, 
the safety of your children also depends on 
you.

For maximum safety, please observe the 
following recommendations:
- 

In accordance with European regulations, 
all children under the age of 12 or less 
than one and a half metres tall must 
travel in an approved child seat suited 
to their weight and installed on a vehicle 
seat fitted with a seat belt or ISOFIX 
mountings*.

-  Statistically, the safest seats in your 
vehicle for carrying children are the 
rear seats.

-  A child weighing less than 9 kg must 
travel in the rearward-facing position 
both in the front and in the rear.

* 

The legislation on carrying children is 
specific to each country.

87

5SafetyChild seat at the rear

5SafetyAdvice

The incorrect installation of a child seat in a 
vehicle compromises the child's protection in 
the event of an accident.
Ensure that there is no seat belt or seat belt 
buckle under the child seat, as this could 
destabilise it.
Remember to fasten the seat belts or the 
child seat harnesses keeping the slack 
relative to the child's body to a minimum, 
even for short journeys.
When installing a child seat using the seat 
belt, ensure that the seat belt is tightened 
correctly on the child seat and that it secures 
the child seat firmly on the seat of your 
vehicle. If your passenger seat is adjustable, 
move it forwards if necessary.
At rear seating positions, always leave 
sufficient space between the front seat and:
- 
- 

a rearward facing child seat,
the child's feet for a child seat fitted 
forward facing.

To do this, move the front seat forwards 
and, if necessary, move its backrest into the 
upright position.

For optimal installation of the forward-facing 
child seat, verify that its backrest is as close 
as possible to the backrest of the vehicle 
seat, or if possible in contact with it.
The head restraint must be removed before 
installing a child seat with a backrest on the 
passenger seat.
Ensure that the headrest is stowed or 
attached securely so that it is not thrown 
around the vehicle in the event of sharp 
braking. Refit the head restraint once the 
child seat has been removed.
Children in front
The legislation on carrying children on the 
front passenger seat is specific to each 
country. Consult the legislation in force in 
your country.
Deactivate the passenger's front airbag 
when a rearward facing child seat is installed 
on the front passenger seat.
Otherwise, the child risks being seriously 
injured or killed if the airbag is deployed.
Installing a booster seat
The chest part of the seat belt must be 
positioned on the child's shoulder without 
touching the neck.

96

Ensure that the lap part of the seat belt 
passes correctly over the child's thighs.
PEUGEOT recommends using a booster seat 
with a backrest equipped with a belt guide at 
shoulder level.
As a safety precaution, do not leave:
- 

a child or children alone and 
unsupervised in a vehicle,
a child or an animal in a vehicle which 
is exposed to the sun, with the windows 
closed,
the keys within reach of children inside 
the vehicle.

- 

- 

To prevent accidental opening of the doors 
and rear windows, use the child lock.
Take care not to open the rear windows by 
more than one third.
To protect young children from the rays of 
the sun, fit side blinds on the rear windows.

Safety"ISOFIX" mountings

Your vehicle has been approved in accordance 
with the latest ISOFIX regulation.
The seats, shown below, are fitted with 
regulation ISOFIX mountings:

There are three rings for each seat:

- 

Two rings A, located between the vehicle 
seat back and cushion, indicated by a 
marking.

To secure the child seat to the TOP TETHER :
-  Pass the child seat strap over the centre of 

the vehicle's seat backrest.
Lift the TOP TETHER cover.

- 
-  Secure the upper strap fixing to the ring B.
- 

Tighten the upper strap.

-  A ring B, located under a cover on the back 

of the top of the seat backrest, referred to 
as the TOP TETHER for fixing the upper 
strap. Its position is indicated by a marking.

The TOP TETHER is used to secure the upper 
strap of child seats that have them. This device 
limits forward tipping of the child seat, in the 
event of a front impact.

This ISOFIX mounting system provides fast, 
reliable and safe fitting of the child seat in your 
vehicle.
The ISOFIX child seats are fitted with two 
latches which are easily secured on the two 
rings A.
Some also have an upper strap which is 
attached to ring B.

When installing an ISOFIX child seat on the 
right hand rear seat, before securing the seat, 
first move the centre rear seat belt towards the 
middle of the vehicle, so as to not interfere with 
the operation of the seat belt.

The incorrect installation of a child seat 
in a vehicle compromises the child's 
protection in case of accident.

Strictly observe the fitting instructions 
provided with the child seat.

For information on the possibilities for installing 
ISOFIX child seats in your vehicle, refer to the 
summary table.

97

5SafetyISOFIX child seats recommended by PEUGEOT and approved 
for your vehicle

This child seat can also be used on seats 
not equipped with ISOFIX mountings.
In this case, it must be secured to the 
vehicle seat using the three-point seat 
belt.
Adjust the front seat of the vehicle so that 
the child's feet do not touch the backrest.

Follow the instructions for fitting 
child seats contained in the seat 
manufacturer's installation guide.

SafetyDriving recommendations

Observe the driving regulations and remain 
vigilant whatever the traffic conditions.
Pay close attention to the traffic and keep your 
hands on the wheel so that you are ready to 
react at any time to any eventuality.
On a long journey, a break every two hours is 
strongly recommended.
In difficult weather, drive smoothly, anticipate 
the need to brake and increase the distance 
from other vehicles.

Driving on flooded roads
We strongly advise against driving on flooded 
roads, as this could cause serious damage 
to the engine or gearbox, as well as to the 
electrical systems of your vehicle.

- 
- 

- 

If you are obliged to drive through water:
- 

check that the depth of water does not 
exceed 15 cm, taking account of waves 
that might be generated by other users,
deactivate the Stop & Start system,
drive as slowly as possible without stalling. 
Under no circumstances exceed 10 km/h,
do not stop and do not switch off the 
engine.

On leaving the flooded road, as soon as 
circumstances allow, make several light brake 
applications to dry the brake discs and pads.
If in doubt on the state of your vehicle, contact 
a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop.

Important!

Never drive with the parking brake  
applied - Risk of overheating and damage 
to the braking system!
Risk of fire!
As the exhaust system of your vehicle 
is very hot, even several minutes after 
switching off the engine, do not park or run 
the engine over areas where inflammable 
substances and materials are present: 
grass, leaves, etc.

Never leave a vehicle unsupervised with 
the engine running. If you have to leave 
your vehicle with the engine running, apply 
the parking brake and put the gearbox into 
neutral or position N or P, depending on 
the type of gearbox.

6DrivingKey starter

Starting-switching off the engine
Anti-theft protection
Electronic engine immobiliser
The key contains an electronic chip which has 
a special code. When the ignition is switched 
on, this code must be recognised in order for 
starting to be possible.
This electronic engine immobiliser locks the 
engine management system a few minutes 
after the ignition is switched off, and prevents 
the engine being started by anyone who does 
not have the key.

It has 3 positions:
- 

position 1 (Stop): insert and removing the 
key, steering column locked,
position 2 (Ignition on): steering column 
unlocked, ignition on, Diesel preheating, 
engine running,
position 3 (Starting).

- 

In the event of a fault, you are 
informed by the illumination of this 
warning light, an audible signal and 
a message in the screen.

 or 

In this case, your vehicle will not start; contact 
a PEUGEOT dealer as soon as possible.

Keep safely, away from your vehicle, the 
label attached to the keys given to you on 
when you purchased your vehicle.

102

Ignition on position
It allows the use of the vehicle's electric 
equipment or portable devices to be charged.
Once the state of charge of the battery drops 
to the reserve level, the system switches to 
energy economy mode : the power supply is 
cut off automatically to preserve the remaining 
battery charge.

Avoid attaching heavy objects to the key 
or the remote control, which would weigh 
down on its blade in the ignition switch 
and could cause a malfunction.
It could adversely affect the deployment of 
the front airbag.

DrivingStarting the engine

The parking brake must be applied.

F  With a manual gearbox, place the gear 
lever in neutral then depress the clutch 
pedal fully.

F  With an automatic gearbox, select  

position P, then firmly press the brake 
pedal.

F  With an electronic gearbox, select  

position N then firmly press the brake 
pedal.
Insert the key into the ignition switch; the 
system recognises the code.

F 

F  Unlock the steering column by 

simultaneously turning the steering and  
the key.

In certain cases, you may have to turn 
the steering wheel energetically to move 
the wheels (for example if the wheels are 
braced against a kerb).

F  With a petrol engine, operate the starter 

motor by turning the key to position 3 
without pressing the accelerator pedal, 
until the engine starts. Once the engine is 
running, release the key.

F  With a Diesel engine, turn the key to 
position 2, ignition on, to operate the 
engine pre-heating system.

If the engine does not start immediately, 
turn off the ignition. Wait a few minutes 
before restarting. If after a few attempts 
the engine does not start, do not persist: 
you risk damaging the starter and the 
engine. Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

Wait until this warning light goes off 
in the instrument panel then operate 
the starter motor by turning the key 
to position 3 without pressing the 
accelerator pedal, until the engine 
starts. Once the engine is running,

not come on.

In temperate conditions, do not leave 
the engine at idle to warm up but move 
off straight away and drive at moderate 
speed.

Never leave the engine running in 
an enclosed area without adequate 
ventilation: internal combustion engines 
emit toxic exhaust gases, such as carbon 
monoxide. There is a risk of poisoning and 
death!
In severe wintry conditions (temperature 
below -23°C), the engine should be left at 
idle for four minutes before moving off to 
ensure the correct operation and life of the 
mechanical parts of your vehicle, engine 
and gearbox.

F  Press button S, after starting the engine.
The gearbox automatically favours a dynamic 
style of driving.

S appears in the instrument panel.

Automatic operation

F  Select position D for automatic changing 

of the six gears.

The gearbox then operates in auto-adaptive 
mode, without any action needed from the 
driver. It continuously selects the most suitable 
gear according to the style of driving, the profile 
of the road and the load in the vehicle.
To obtain maximum acceleration without 
touching the selector, press the accelerator 
pedal all the way down (kick down). The 
gearbox changes down automatically or 
maintains the gear selected until the maximum 
engine speed is reached.
When braking, the gearbox changes down 
automatically to provide effective engine 
braking.
If you release the accelerator sharply, the 
gearbox will not change to a higher gear for 
safety reasons.

Never select position N while the vehicle 
is moving.
Never select positions P or R unless the 
vehicle is completely stationary.

112

Reverse gear
When selecting reverse R with the ignition 
on, the rear parking sensors are activated 
automatically.
For more information on Rear parking 
sensors, refer to the corresponding section.

Autonomous traction function 
(moving without using the 
accelerator)
This function facilitates manoeuvring of the 
vehicle at low speed (when parking, in traffic 
jams, …).
With the engine at idle, parking brake released 
and position D, M or R selected, the vehicle 
moves as soon as you take your foot off 
the brake pedal (even without pressing the 
accelerator).

DrivingSnow programme T
F  Press the "T" button, after starting the

F  Move the selector towards the - sign to 

change down a gear.

It is only possible to change from one gear to 
another if the vehicle speed and engine speed 
permit; otherwise, the gearbox will operate 
temporarily in automatic mode.

D disappears and the gears 
engaged appear in succession in 
the instrument panel.

If the engine speed is too low or too high, the 
gear selected flashes for a few seconds, then 
the actual gear engaged is displayed.
It is possible to change from position D 
(automatic) to position M (manual) at any time.
When the vehicle is stationary or moving 
very slowly, the gearbox engages first gear 
automatically.

The sport and snow programmes are 
inactive in manual operation.

Invalid value during manual 
operation

This symbol is displayed if a gear 
is not engaged correctly (selector 
between two positions).

113

6DrivingStopping the vehicle
Before switching off the engine, you can 
engage position P or N to place the gearbox in 
neutral.
In both cases, apply the parking brake to 
immobilise the vehicle.

If the selector is not in position P, when the 
driver's door is opened or approximately 
45 seconds after the ignition is switched 
off, a warning message appears in the 
screen.
F  Return the selector to position P; the 

message disappears.

When driving on flooded roads or when 
crossing a ford, proceed at walking pace.

Malfunction

When the ignition is on, the lighting 
of this warning light, accompanied 
by an audible signal and a message 
in the screen, indicates a gearbox 
fault.

 or 

In this case, the gearbox goes into back-up 
mode by staying in 3rd gear. You may feel a 
substantial knock when changing from P to R  
and from N to R. This will not cause any 
damage to the gearbox.
Do not exceed 60 mph (100 km/h), local speed 
restrictions permitting.
Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop as soon as possible.

114

There is a risk of damage to the gearbox:
- 

if you press the accelerator and brake 
pedals at the same time,
if you force the movement of the 
selector from the P position to another 
position when the battery is dead.

- 

To reduce fuel consumption when at 
a prolonged standstill with the engine 
running (traffic jam, etc.), put the 
selector in the N position and apply the 
parking brake.

DrivingGear shift indicator

System which reduces fuel consumption by 
advising the driver when to change up.

With an electronic or automatic gearbox, 
the system is only active in manual mode.

Operation
Depending on the driving situation and the 
equipment of your vehicle, the system can 
recommend you to skip one (or several) 
gear(s). You can follow this instruction without 
going through the intermediate gears.
The gear engagement recommendations 
should not be considered to be compulsory. As 
a matter of fact, road conditions, traffic density 
and safety remain decisive elements when 
choosing the optimal gear. Therefore, the driver 
remains responsible for deciding whether or not 
to follow the advice given by the system.
This function cannot be deactivated.

Example:
-  You are in third gear.
-  You press the accelerator pedal.
- 

The system may suggest that you engage 
a higher gear.

The information appears in the instrument 
panel in the form of an arrow.

The system adapts its gear change 
recommendation according to the 
driving conditions (slope, load, etc.) 
and the demands of the driver (power, 
acceleration, braking, etc.).
The system never suggests:
- 
- 
- 

engaging first gear,
engaging reverse gear,
changing down.

On vehicles fitted with a manual gearbox, 
the arrow is accompanied by the 
recommended gear.

115

6DrivingStop & Start

The Stop & Start system puts the engine 
temporarily into standby - STOP mode - during 
stops in the traffic (red lights, traffic jams, or 
other...). The engine restarts automatically - 
START mode - as soon as you want to move 
off. Restarting occurs instantly, quickly and 
silently.
Perfect for urban use, the Stop & Start system 
reduces fuel consumption and exhaust 
emissions as well as the noise level when 
stationary.

Operation
Going into engine STOP mode

With an electronic gearbox, the 
"ECO" indicator illuminates in the 
instrument panel and the engine 
goes into standby when and the 
brake pedal is pressed or the gear 
selector is moved into position N 
while the vehicle is stationary.

For your comfort, during parking 
manoeuvres, STOP mode is not available 
for a few seconds after coming out of 
reverse gear.
The STOP mode does not affect the 
operation of vehicle systems such as 
braking, power steering...

Never refuel with the engine in STOP 
mode; you must switch off the ignition 
using the key.

Special cases: STOP mode not 
available
STOP mode is not invoked when:
- 
- 
- 

The driver's door is open.
The driver's seat belt is not fastened.
The engine is needed to maintain a 
comfortable temperature in the passenger 
compartment.

-  Demisting is active.
-  Some special conditions (battery charge, 
engine temperature, braking assistance, 
climate control...) need it to control the 
system.

The "ECO" warning light flashes for 
a few seconds, then goes off.

This operation is perfectly normal.

116

DrivingGoing into engine START mode

With an electronic gearbox, the 
"ECO" warning light goes off and the 
engine restarts automatically when:

- 

- 

- 

you release the brake pedal with the gear 
selector in position A or M,
you are in position N with the brake pedal 
released and you move the gear selector to 
position A or M,
you engage reverse.

Special cases: START mode 
invoked automatically
As a safety measure or to maintain comfort 
levels in the vehicle, START mode is invoked 
automatically when:
-  You open the driver's door.
-  You unfasten the driver's seat belt.
- 

The speed of the vehicle exceeds 2 mph  
(3 km/h) with an electronic gearbox.

-  Some specific conditions (battery charge, 
engine temperature, braking assistance, 
climate control, etc.) need it to ensure 
control of a system or the vehicle.

Manual deactivation / 
reactivation
In certain circumstances, such as the need 
to maintain the temperature in the passenger 
compartment, it may be useful to deactivate the 
Stop & Start system.
The system can be deactivated at any time, 
once the ignition is switched on.
If the engine is in STOP mode, it then restarts.
The Stop & Start system is reactivated 
automatically every time the ignition is switched 
on.

The "ECO" warning light flashes for 
a few seconds, then goes off.

This operation is perfectly normal.

qualified workshop.
In the event of a fault in STOP mode, the 
vehicle may stall. All of the instrument panel 
warning lights come on. It is then necessary to 
switch the ignition off and to restart the engine 
using the key.

The Stop & Start system requires a 12 V  
battery of specific technology and 
specification.
All work on this type of battery must be 
carried out only by a PEUGEOT dealer or 
a qualified workshop.
For more information on the 12 V battery, 
refer to the corresponding section.

DrivingSpeed limiter

System which prevents the vehicle from 
exceeding the speed programmed by the 
driver.
When the programmed speed limit is reached, 
pressing the accelerator pedal in the normal 
manner no longer has any effect.
The speed limiter is switched on manually: it 
requires a programmed speed of at least  
20 mph (30 km/h).
The speed limiter is switched off by manual 
operation of the control.
The programmed speed can be exceeded 
temporarily by pressing the accelerator firmly.
To return to the programmed speed, simply 
slow down to a speed below the programmed 
speed.

DrivingRear parking sensors

Audible assistance

Visual assistance

The proximity information is given by an 
intermittent audible signal, the frequency of 
which increases as the vehicle approaches the 
obstacle.
The sound emitted by the speaker (right or 
left) indicates the side on which the obstacle is 
located.
When the distance between the vehicle and 
the obstacle becomes less than approximately 
thirty centimetres, the audible signal becomes 
continuous.

This supplements the audible signal by 
displaying bars in the screen which move 
progressively nearer to the vehicle.
When the obstacle is very close, the "Danger" 
symbol is displayed on the screen.

This system indicates the proximity of an 
obstacle (person, vehicle, tree, gate, etc.) 
entering the field of detection of sensors 
located in the bumper.

Due to blind areas, obstacles of certain types 
(posts, worksite markers, etc.) which were 
detected initially won't be any longer by the end 
of the operation.

This system cannot in any circumstances 
replace the need for vigilance on the part 
of the driver.

The system is switched on by engaging the 
reverse gear. This is accompanied by an 
audible signal.
The system is switched off when you come out

Fuel
Capacity of the tank: 50 litres approximately.
Low fuel level

When the low fuel level is reached 
this warning light comes on in the 
instrument panel.

When it first comes on, around 5 litres of fuel 
remain in the tank.
You must refuel as soon as possible to avoid 
running out of fuel.
For more information on Running out of fuel 
(Diesel), refer to the corresponding section.

Opening

F  Raise the lever.

Refuelling

F  Open the filler cap by turning it a 1/4 turn to 

the left.

A label on the inside of the fuel filler flap 
reminds you of the type of fuel to use, 
depending on your engine type.
Additions of fuel must be of at least 5 litres, in 
order to be registered by the fuel gauge.

F  Remove the filler cap and hang it on its 

carrier (on the filler flap).

F  Fill the tank. Do not continue past the third 

cut-off of the nozzle, as this may cause 
malfunctions.

F  Replace the filler cap turning it a 1/4 turn to 

the right.

F  Push the fuel filler flap to close it.

Opening the filler cap may create a noise 
a caused by an inrush of air. This vacuum 
is entirely normal and results from the 
sealing of the fuel system.

If you have put in the wrong fuel for 
your vehicle, you must have the fuel 
tank drained and filled with the correct 
fuel before starting the engine.

129

7Practical informationFuel cut-off

Your vehicle is equipped with a safety device 
which cuts off the fuel supply in the event of a 
collision.

Misfuel prevention (Diesel)

(Depending on the country of sale.)
Mechanical device which prevents filling the tank of a Diesel vehicle with petrol. It avoids the risk of 
engine damage that can result from filling with the wrong fuel.
Located in the filler neck, the misfuel prevention device appears when the filler cap is removed.
Operation

It remains possible to use a fuel can to fill 
the tank.
In order to ensure a good flow of fuel, 
do not place the nozzle of the fuel can in 
direct contact with the flap of the misfuel 
prevention device and pour slowly.

Travelling abroad
As Diesel fuel pump nozzles may be 
different in other countries, the presence 
of the misfuel prevention device may make 
refuelling impossible.
Not all Diesel vehicles are fitted with 
misfuel protection, so before travelling 
abroad, we recommend that you check 
with the PEUGEOT dealer network, 
whether your vehicle is suitable for the 
fuel pumps in the country in which you 
intend to travel.

When a petrol filler nozzle is introduced into the 
fuel filler neck of your Diesel vehicle, it comes 
into contact with the flap. The system remains 
closed and prevents filling.
Do not persist but introduce a Diesel type 
filler nozzle.

130

Practical informationCompatibility of 
fuels
Fuel used for petrol engines
The petrol engines are compatible with biofuels 
that conform to current and future European 
standards and can be obtained from filling 
stations:

Petrol that meets the EN228 standard, 
mixed with a bio-fuel meeting the 
EN15376 standard.

The only petrol additives authorised for 
use are those that meet the B715001 
standard.

Fuel used for Diesel engines
The Diesel engines are compatible with 
biofuels that conform to current and future 
European standards and can be obtained from 
filling stations:

Diesel fuel that meets standard 
EN590 mixed with a biofuel that meets 
standard EN14214 (possibly containing 
up to 7% Fatty Acid Methyl Ester),

Diesel fuel that meets standard 
EN16734 mixed with a biofuel that 
meets standard EN14214 (possibly 
containing up to 10% Fatty Acid Methyl 
Ester),
Paraffinic Diesel fuel that meets 
standard EN15940 mixed with a biofuel 
that meets standard EN14214 (possibly 
containing up to 7% Fatty Acid Methyl 
Ester).
The use of B20 or B30 fuel that meets 
the standard EN16709 is possible 
with your Diesel engine. However, this 
use, even occasional, requires strict 
application of the special servicing 
conditions referred to as "Arduous 
conditions".

The only Diesel additives authorised for 
use are those that meet the B715000 
standard.

Diesel at low temperature
At temperatures below 0°C (+32°F), the 
formation of paraffins in summer-type diesel 
fuels could entail an abnormal operation 
of the fuel supply circuit. To avoid this, we 
recommend using winter-type diesel fuel and 
keeping the fuel tank more than 50% full.
If, despite this, at temperatures below -15°C 
(+5°F) the engine has problems starting, 
just leave the vehicle in a garage or heated 
workshop for a little while.

For more information, contact a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

The use of any other type of (bio)fuel 
(vegetable or animal oils, pure or diluted, 
domestic fuel...) is strictly prohibited (risk 
of damage to the engine and fuel system).

Travelling abroad
Certain fuels could damage the engine of your

7Practical informationAdBlue® and SCR system for BlueHDi Diesel engines

SCR system
Using a fluid called AdBlue® containing urea, a 
catalytic converter turns up to 85% of nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) into nitrogen and water, which are 
harmless to health and the environment.

TheAdBlue® is contained in a specific tank of 
approximately 17 litres. Its capacity allows a 
driving range of around 12,500 miles  
(20,000 km). An alert system is triggered 
automatically once the reserve level is reached: 
you can then drive for a further 1,500 miles 
(2,400 km) before the tank is empty.

During each scheduled service of your vehicle 
by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop, 
the AdBlue® tank is refilled in order to allow 
normal operation of the SCR system.

If the estimated mileage of your vehicle 
between two services is greater than  
12,500 miles (20,000 km), it will be necessary 
to top-up the AdBlue®.

Once the AdBlue® tank is empty, a system 
required by regulations prevents starting 
of the engine.
If the SCR system is faulty, the level of 
emissions from your vehicle will no longer 
meet the Euro 6 standard: your vehicle 
becomes polluting.
In the event of a confirmed fault with the 
SCR system, you must go to a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop as soon 
as possible: after a running distance of 
650 miles (1,100 km), a system will be 
triggered automatically to prevent engine 
starting.
In either case, a range indicator gives you 
the distance you can travel before the 
vehicle is immobilised.

To assure respect for the environment and 
conformity with the new Euro 6 emissions 
standard, without adversely affecting the 
performance or fuel consumption of Diesel 
engines, PEUGEOT has taken the decision to 
equip its vehicles with an effective system that 
associates the SCR system (Selective Catalytic 
Reduction) with a particle filter (FAP) for the 
treatment of exhaust gases.

132

Practical informationTopping-up the AdBlue®
Filling the AdBlue® tank is an operation 
included in every routine service on your 
vehicle by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.
Nevertheless, given the capacity of the tank, it 
may be necessary to top-up the fluid between 
services, more particularly if an alert (warning 
lamps and a message) signals the requirement.
You can go to a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.
If you envisage topping-up yourself, please 
read the following warnings carefully.

Freezing of the AdBlue®
AdBlue® freezes at temperatures below 
around -11°C.
The SCR system includes a heater for the 
AdBlue® tank, allowing you to continue 
driving in all weather conditions.

Precautions in use
AdBlue® is a urea-based solution. This liquid is 
non-flammable, colourless and odourless (kept 
in a cool area).
In the event of contact with the skin, wash the 
affected area with soap and water. In the event 
of contact with the eyes, wash (irrigate) the 
eyes copiously under running water or with an 
eye wash solution for at least 15 minutes. If 
a burning sensation or irritation persists, get 
medical attention.
If swallowed, immediately wash out the mouth 
with clean water and then drink plenty of water.
In certain conditions (high ambient 
temperature, for example), the risk of release of 
ammonia cannot be excluded: do not inhale the 
fluid. Ammonia vapour has an irritant effect on 
mucous membranes (eyes, nose and throat).

Keep AdBlue® out of the reach of children, 
in its original container or bottle.
Never transfer AdBlue® to another 
container: it would lose its purity.

Use only AdBlue® fluid that meets the  
ISO 22241 standard.

Never dilute AdBlue® with water.
Never pour AdBlue® into the Diesel fuel 
tank.

The supply in a non-drip container or bottle 
simplifies topping-up. You can obtain 1.89 litre 
(half a US gallon) bottles or 5 litre containers 
from a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

Never top-up from an AdBlue® dispenser 
reserved for heavy goods vehicles.

133

7Practical informationProcedure
Before topping-up, ensure that the vehicle is 
parked on a flat and level surface.
In wintry conditions, ensure that the 
temperature of the vehicle is above -11°C. 
Otherwise the AdBlue® may be frozen and 
so cannot be poured into its tank. Park your 
vehicle in a warmer area for a few hours to 
allow the top-up to be carried out.

F  Switch of the ignition and remove the key.

Recommendations on storage
AdBlue® freezes below around -11°C and 
deteriorates above 25°C. It is recommended 
that bottles or containers be stored in a cool 
place and protected from direct sunlight.
Under these conditions, the fluid can be kept 
for at least a year.
If the fluid has frozen, it can be used once 
it has completely thawed out at ambient 
temperature.

Never store bottles or containers of 
AdBlue® in your vehicle.

Do not dispose of AdBlue® bottles or 
containers in the household waste.
Place them in a container provided for 
this purpose or take them to your dealer.

F  Unclip the plastic valve.

F 

Insert your fingers into the aperture and 
turn the blue cap a 6th of a turn anti-
clockwise.

F  Carefully lift off the cap, without dropping it.

134

Practical informationF  After emptying the bottle, wipe away any 

spillage around the tank filler using a damp 
cloth.

If any additive is spilt or splashed, wash 
immediately with cold water or wipe with a 
damp cloth.
If the additive has crystallised, clean it off 
using a sponge and hot water.

F  Refit the blue cap to the tank and turn it a 

6th of a turn clockwise, to its stop.

F  Replace the plastic valve, clipping it in the 

opening.

F  Return the storage box containing the tools 

to its location.

F  Replace the boot floor and close the boot.

Once the AdBlue tank has been filled, 
make sure that the driver as well as the 
passengers exit the vehicle, then lock it.
After a minimum delay of 5 minutes 
without opening it, unlock the vehicle and 
switch the ignition on without starting.
After a minimum of 10 seconds, start the 
vehicle.

Never dispose of AdBlue® additive 
bottles in the household waste. Place 
them in a container provided for this 
purpose or take them to your dealer.

F  Get a bottle of AdBlue®. After first 

checking the use-by date, read carefully 
the instructions on use on the label before 
pouring the contents of the bottle into your 
vehicle's AdBlue® tank.

Important: if your vehicle's AdBlue® tank is 
completely empty - which is confirmed by 
the alert displays and the impossibility of 
starting the engine - you must add at least 
3.8 litres (so two 1.89 litre bottles).

Practical informationChecking levels

Check all of these levels regularly, in line with the manufacturer's service schedule. Top them up if necessary, unless otherwise indicated.
If a level drops significantly, have the corresponding system checked by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop.

Take care when working under the bonnet, as certain areas of the engine may be extremely hot (risk of burns) and the cooling fan could start at 
any time (even with the ignition off).

Engine oil level

Checking using the dipstick

This level is checked using the 
dipstick located under the bonnet.  
To find this gauge, see the description 
of the engine compartment.

To ensure the accuracy of the reading, your 
vehicle must be on a level surface, with the 
engine off for at least 30 minutes.

It is normal to top-up the oil level between 
services (or oil changes). PEUGEOT 
recommends that you check the level, and 
top up if necessary, every 3,000 miles  
(5,000 km).

For more information about , and in particular 
the dipstick location, refer to the corresponding 
section.

The check and top-up must only be done with 
the engine cold.
A low coolant level presents a risk of serious 
damage to your engine.
The coolant level should be close to the "MAX" 
mark but should never exceed it.
If the level is close to or below the "MIN" mark, 
it is essential to top-up.

When the engine is hot, the temperature of the 
coolant is regulated by the fan.
In addition, as the cooling system is 
pressurised, wait at least one hour after 
switching off the engine before carrying out any 
work.
To avoid the risk of scalding when you need to 
top-up in an emergency, place a cloth around 
the cap and unscrew the cap by two turns to 
allow the pressure to drop.
Once the pressure has dropped, remove the 
cap and top-up the level.

the hub cap using the wheel wrench1 by 
pulling at the valve aperture.
When refitting the wheel, after tightening 
the wheel bolts, refit the hub cap, starting 
by placing its aperture in line with the 
valve and then pushing it into place all 
round its edge with the palm of your hand.

Removing a wheel
Parking the vehicle

Immobilise the vehicle where it does not 
block traffic: the ground must be level, 
stable and non-slippery.
Apply the parking brake, switch off the 
ignition and engage first gear* to lock the 
wheels.
Check that the parking brake warning 
lamp illuminates steadily in the instrument 
panel.
The occupants must get out of the vehicle 
and wait where they are safe.
Make sure that the jack is correctly 
positioned at one of the vehicle's jacking 
points.
Incorrect use of the jack could cause the 
vehicle to drop.
Never go underneath a vehicle raised 
using a jack; use an axle stand.

*  Position R for an electronic gearbox; P for 

an automatic gearbox.

List of operations

Procedure for starting the engine using another battery or charging a discharged battery.
General points
Lead-acid starter batteries

Access to the battery

Batteries contain harmful substances 
such as sulphuric acid and lead.
They must be disposed of in 
accordance with regulations and must 
not, in any circumstances, be discarded 
with household waste.
Take used remote control batteries and 
vehicle batteries to a special collection 
point.

Protect your eyes and face before 
handling the battery.
All operations on the battery must be 
carried out in a well ventilated area and 
away from naked flames and sources of 
sparks, so as to avoid the risk of explosion 
or fire.
Wash your hands afterwards.

172

Versions equipped with Stop & Start are 
fitted with a 12 V lead-acid battery of 
specific technology and specification.
Its replacement should be carried out 
only by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

If you have an electronic or automatic 
gearbox, never try to start the engine by

In the event of a breakdownStarting using another 
battery
When your vehicle's battery is discharged, the 
engine can be started using a slave battery 
(external or on another vehicle) and jump lead 
cables or a battery booster.

Never try to start the engine by connecting 
a battery charger.
Never use a 24 V or higher battery 
booster.
Check beforehand that the slave battery 
has a nominal voltage of 12 V and a 
minimum capacity equal to that of the 
discharged battery.
The two vehicles must not be in contact 
with each other.
Switch off the electrical consumers on 
both vehicles (audio system, wipers, 
lighting, ...).
Ensure that the jump lead cables do not 
pass close to moving parts of the engine 
(cooling fan, belts, ...).
Do not disconnect the (+) terminal when 
the engine is running.

F  Start the engine of the vehicle with the 

good battery and leave it running for a few 
minutes.

F  Operate the starter on the broken down 

vehicle and let the engine run.

switch off the ignition and wait a few moments 
before trying again.
F  Wait until the engine returns to idle then 
disconnect the jump lead cables in the 
reverse order.

F  Refit the plastic cover to the (+) terminal, if 

your vehicle has one.

F  Allow the engine to run for at least  

30 minutes, by driving or with the vehicle 
stationary, so that the battery reaches an 
adequate state of charge.

Some functions, including Stop & Start, 
are not available if the battery is not 
sufficiently charged.

173

F  Raise the plastic cover on the (+) terminal, 

if your vehicle has one.

F  Connect the red cable to the positive 
terminal (+) of the flat battery A (at the 
metal elbow) then to the positive terminal 
(+) of the slave battery B or the booster.
F  Connect one end of the green or black 
cable to the negative terminal (-) of the 
slave battery B or the booster (or earth 
point on the other vehicle).

F  Connect the other end of the green or black 

cable to the earth point C on the broken 
down vehicle.

8In the event of a breakdownCharging the battery using 
a battery charger
For optimum service life of the battery, it is 
essential to maintain an adequate state of 
charge.
In some circumstances it may be necessary to 
charge the battery:
- 

If you use your vehicle essentially for short 
journeys.
If the vehicle is to be taken off the road for 
several weeks.

- 

Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

If you envisage charging your vehicle's 
battery yourself, use only a charger 
compatible with lead-based batteries of a 
nominal voltage of 12 V.

Follow the instructions for use provided by 
the charger manufacturer.
Never reverse polarities.

It is not necessary to disconnect the 
battery.

174

F  Switch off the ignition.
F  Switch off all electricity consuming devices 

(audio system, lighting, wipers, etc.).

F  Switch off the charger B before connecting 
the cables to the battery, so as to avoid any 
dangerous sparks.

F  Ensure that the charger cables are in good 

F 

condition.
 Raise the plastic cover, if your vehicle has 
one, on the (+) terminal.

F  Connect the charger B cables as follows:

-  The positive (+) red cable to the (+) 

terminal of the battery A.

-  The negative (-) black cable to the earth 

point C on the vehicle.

F  At the end of the charging operation, switch 
off the charger B before disconnecting the 
cables from the battery A.

If this label is present, it is essential to 
use only a 12 V charger to avoid causing 
irreversible damage to the electrical 
components related to the Stop & Start 
system.

Never try any charge a frozen battery - 
Risk of explosion!
If the battery has frozen, have it checked 
by a PEUGEOT dealer or by a qualified 
workshop who will check that the internal 
components have not been damaged and 
that the container has not cracked, which 
would mean a risk of toxic and corrosive 
acid leaking.

is higher than that of the towed vehicle.
The driver must remain at the wheel of the 
towed vehicle and must have a valid driving 
licence.
When towing a vehicle with all four wheels 
on the ground, always use an approved 
towing arm; rope and straps are prohibited.
The towing vehicle must move off gently.
When the vehicle is towed with its engine 
off, there is no more braking and steering 
assistance.

In the following cases, you must always call 
on a professional recovery service :
- 

vehicle broken down on a motorway or 
fast road,
four-wheel drive vehicle,

- 
-  when it is not possible to put the gearbox 

into neutral, unlock the steering, or 
release the parking brake,
towing with only two wheels on the 
ground,

- 

-  where there is no approved towing arm 

available...

178

In the event of a breakdownEngines and 
specifications

The engine specifications (displacement, max. 
power, max. speed, energy, CO2 emissions, 
etc.) associated with your vehicle are 
mentioned in the registration certificate, and in 
the commercial documents.
These characteristics correspond to the values 
type-approved on a test bed, under conditions 
defined in European legislation (Directive 
1999/99/EC).
For more information, contact a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

Weights and towed 
loads

The weights and towed loads relating to your 
vehicle are stated in the registration certificate, 
and in the sales documentation.
These values are also shown on the 
manufacturer's nameplate or label.
For more information, contact a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.
The mass in working order is equal to the 
weight when empty + driver (75 kg).
The GTW values and the towable loads listed 
are valid for a maximum altitude of 1,000 
additional metres.
The weight of the braked trailer can be 
increased, within the GTW limit, if the GVW 
of the towing vehicle is reduced by an equal 
amount.
The recommended nose weight corresponds 
to the weight permitted on the tow-bar 
(dismantlable with or without a tool).
GVW: gross vehicle weight, the maximum 
authorised vehicle weight.
GTW: Gross train weight

High ambient temperatures may result 
in a reduction in the performance of the 
vehicle to protect the engine. When the 
ambient temperature is above 37°C, limit 
the weight towed.

Towing with a towing vehicle which is only 
slightly laden may negatively affect its 
handling.
Towing a trailer increases the braking 
distance.
The speed of a towing vehicle must not 
exceed 60 mph (100 km/h) (comply with 
the legislation in force in your country).

When the ambient temperature is high, 
leaving the engine running for 1 to 2 minutes 
after stopping the vehicle to allow it to cool is 
recommended.

Technical dataIdentification markings

Various visible markings for the identification of your vehicle.

A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) 

under the bonnet.
This number is engraved on the bodywork 
near the passenger compartment filter.

D Manufacturer's label.

The number is indicated on a self-
destroying label affixed to the lower part 
of the right hand centre pillar.

The vehicle may be originally equipped 
with tyres with higher load and speed 
indices than those indicated on the label, 
without affecting inflation pressure.

Checking tyre pressures
The tyre pressures should be checked when 
cold at least monthly.
The pressures given on the label are valid for 
cold tyres. If you have driven for more than  
10 minutes or more than 6 miles (10 kilometres) 
at more than 30 mph (50 km/h), the tyres will be 
warm. In this case 0.3 bar (30 kPa) should be 
added to the pressures given on the label.

B Vehicle identification number on the 

dashboard.
The number is recorded on a label, visible 
through the windscreen.

Low tyre pressure introduces the risk of a 
burst tyre.

Never reduce the pressure of a warm tyre.

C Tyre/paint label.

This label is affixed to the centre pillar on 
the driver’s side.
It bears the following information:
- 

The tyre pressures, for unladen and 
laden conditions.
The tyre sizes.
The spare tyre inflation pressure.
The paint colour code.

- 
- 
- 

Low tyre pressures increase fuel 
consumption.

Your audio system is coded in such a way that 
it will only operate in your vehicle.

As a safety measure, the driver must 
only carry out operations which require

RDS, if displayed, makes it possible 
to continue listening to the same radio 
station using the alternative frequencies 
function. However, in certain conditions, 
coverage of an RDS station may not be 
assured throughout the entire country 
as radio stations do not cover 100% of 
the territory. This explains the loss of 
reception of the station during a journey.

Information and advice

The audio system will only play files 
with extension ".mp3" or ".wma" and 
a compression rate that is constant or 
variable between 32 Kbps and  
320 Kbps.

File names should have less than  
20 characters, avoiding special 
characters (e.g.: “ ? ; ù) so as to avoid 
any reading or display problems.

Playlists accepted are types .m3u and .pls.
The number of files is limited to 5,000 in 
500 directories on a maximum of 8 levels.

On a single disc, the CD player can 
read up to 255 MP3 files spread 
over 8 directory levels. However, it is 
recommended that this be kept to 2 levels 
so as to limit the time taken to access and 
play the CD.
The folder structure is not observed during 
playback.

AUDIO and TELEMATICSIn order to be able to play a burned 
CDR or CDRW, select standards  
ISO 9660 level 1, 2 or Joliet if possible 
when burning the CD.
If the disc is burned in another format, it 
may not be played correctly.
It is recommended that the same 
burning standard is always used on an 
individual disc, with the lowest speed 
possible (4x maximum) for the best 
acoustic quality.
In the particular case of a multi-
session CD, the Joliet standard is 
recommended.

Do not connect a hard disk or USB device 
other than audio players to the USB 
port. This may cause damage to your 
installation.

seconds to several minutes.
The playlists are updated every time the 
ignition is switched off or a USB memory 
stick is connected.
Play starts automatically after a certain 
amount of time depending on the capacity 
of the USB memory stick.

Onboard audio: le Sound Staging 
d'Arkamys©.
With Sound Staging, the driver and the 
passengers are immersed into a "sound 
stage" recreating the natural atmosphere 
of a theatre: truly centre stage in surround 
sound.
This new sensation is possible thanks 
to the software installed in the radio 
which processed the digital signals of the 
media players (radio, CD, MP3...) without 
changing the setting of the loudspeakers. 
This process takes into account the 
features of the passenger compartment 
for optimum performance.
The Arkamys© software installed in your 
audio system processes the digital signal 
of all the media players (radio, CD, MP3...) 
and makes it possible to recreate a 
natural sound setting, with a harmonious 
placement of the instruments and 
voices in space, facing the passengers, 
positioned at the height of the windscreen.

AUDIO and TELEMATICSFrequently asked questions

The following tables contain answers to the most frequently asked questions.

QUESTION

RESPONSE

SOLUTION

There is a difference in sound quality between 
the different audio sources (radio, CD...).

To allow for optimal listening quality, the audio 
settings (Volume, Bass, Treble, Ambience, 
Loudness) can be tailored to different 
sound sources, which can generate audible 
differences when changing source (radio, CD...).

Check that the audio settings (volume, bass, 
treble, ambience, loudness) are adapted to 
the sources listened to. It is advisable to set 
the AUDIO functions (Bass, Treble, Front-
Rear Fader, Left-Right Balance) to the middle 
position, select the musical ambience "None" 
and set the loudness correction to the "Active" 
position in CD mode or to the "Inactive" position 
in radio mode.

When changing the settings for treble and bass, 
the ambience setting is deselected.
When changing the ambience setting, treble 
and bass are reset to zero.

Choosing an ambience imposes settings for 
treble and bass. Modifying one without the other 
is not possible.

Modify the treble and bass settings or the 
ambience setting to obtain the desired sound 
quality.

.AUDIO and TELEMATICSQUESTION

RESPONSE

SOLUTION

When changing the balance setting, distribution 
is deselected.

Choosing a distribution setting imposes a 
balance setting. Modifying one without the other 
is not possible.

Modify the balance setting or the distribution 
setting to obtain the desired sound quality.

The reception quality of the tuned radio station 
gradually deteriorates or the stored stations are 
not working (no sound, 87.5 Mhz is displayed ...).

The vehicle is too far from the transmitter of 
the station or no transmitter is present in the 
geographical area.

Activate the RDS mode and start a new search 
for the station so that the system can check 
whether a stronger transmitter is available in the 
geographic area.

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, 
basement car parks...) block reception, including 
in RDS mode.

This phenomenon is normal and does not 
indicate a failure of the audio equipment.

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for 
example when going through an automatic car 
wash or in an underground car park).

Have the antenna checked by the PEUGEOT 
network.

Sound cut-outs of 1 to 2 seconds in radio mode. During this brief sound cut-out, the RDS 

searches for another frequency giving better 
reception of the station.

Switch off the RDS function if the phenomenon 
is too frequent and always on the same route.

The traffic announcement (TA) is displayed. I do 
not receive any traffic information.

The radio station does not broadcast traffic 
information.

Tune to a radio station which broadcasts traffic 
information.

Information and advice

The audio system can only play 
files with ".mp3", ".wma" or ".wav" 
extensions.

A high compression rate could damage 
the quality of the sound.

File names should have less than  
20 characters, avoiding special 
characters (e.g.: “ ? ; ù) so as to avoid 
any reading or display problems.

Playlists accepted are types .m3u  
and .pls.
The system can recognise up to 5,000 files 
in 500 folders on 8 levels.

Playing a compilation

Insert an MP3 compilation 
in the CD player.

The system creates playlists (temporary 
memory); this operation can take from a 
few seconds to several minutes.

To play a disc which has already 
been inserted, press the SRC/
BAND button repeatedly until the 
source CD is displayed.

Press one of the buttons to select 
the next or previous track.

On a given disc, the CD player can read 
up to 255 MP3 files spread over 8 levels. 
However, it is recommended that this 
be kept to 2 levels so as to limit the time 
taken to access and play the CD.
The folder structure is not observed during 
playback.

In order to be able to play a burned 
CDR or CDRW, select standards  
ISO 9660 level 1, 2 or Joliet if possible 
when burning the CD.
If the disc is burned in another format, it 
may not be played correctly.
It is recommended that the same 
burning standard is always used on an 
individual disc, with the lowest speed 
possible (4x maximum) for the best 
acoustic quality.
In the particular case of a multi-
session CD, the Joliet standard is 
recommended.

AUDIO and TELEMATICSFrequently asked questions
The following tables contain answers to the most frequently asked questions.

QUESTION

RESPONSE

SOLUTION

There is a difference in sound quality between 
the different audio sources (radio, CD...).

To allow for optimal listening quality, the audio 
settings (Volume, Bass, Treble, Ambience, 
Loudness) can be tailored to different sound 
sources, which can generate audible differences 
when changing source (radio, CD...).

Check that the audio settings (volume, bass, 
treble, ambience, loudness) are adapted to 
the sources listened to. It is advisable to set 
the AUDIO functions (Bass, Treble, Front-
Rear Fader, Left-Right Balance) to the middle 
position, select the musical ambience "None" 
and set the loudness correction to the "Active" 
position in CD mode or to the "Inactive" position 
in radio mode.

When changing the settings for treble and bass, 
the ambience setting is deselected.
When changing the ambience setting, treble and 
bass are reset to zero.
The reception quality of the tuned radio station 
gradually deteriorates or the stored stations are 
not working (no sound, 87.5 Mhz is displayed ...).

Choosing an ambience imposes settings for 
treble and bass. Modifying one without the other 
is not possible.

Modify the treble and bass settings or the 
ambience setting to obtain the desired sound 
quality.

The vehicle is too far from the transmitter of 
the station or no transmitter is present in the 
geographical area.

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, 
basement car parks...) block reception, including 
in RDS mode.

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for 
example when going through a car wash or into 
an underground car park).

Activate the RDS mode and start a new search 
for the station so that the system can check 
whether a stronger transmitter is available in the 
geographic area.
This phenomenon is normal and does not 
indicate a failure of the audio equipment.

Have the antenna checked by the PEUGEOT 
network.

The different functions and settings 
described vary according to the version 
and configuration of your vehicle.

As a safety measure and because it 
requires sustained attention by the 
driver, the pairing of a Bluetooth mobile 
telephone with the Bluetooth hands-free 
system of your audio system must be 
done with the vehicle stationary and the 
ignition on.

The system is protected in such a way that 
it will only operate in your vehicle.
The display of the Energy Economy 
Mode message signals that a change to 
standby is imminent.

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, 
basement car parks...) block reception, including 
in RDS mode.

This phenomenon is normal and does not 
indicate a failure of the audio equipment.

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for 
example when going through a car wash or into 
an underground car park).

Have the aerial checked by a Brand dealer.

I cannot find some radio stations in the list of 
stations received.
The name of the radio station changes.

The station is not received or has changed its 
name in the list.
Some radio stations send other information 
in place of their name (the title of the song for 
example).
The system interprets these details as the 
station name.

QUESTION
Playback of my USB memory stick starts only 
after a very long wait (around 2 to 3 minutes).

The CD is ejected every time or is not played.

RESPONSE
Some files supplied with the memory stick 
may greatly slow down access to reading 
the memory stick (multiplication by 10 of the 
catalogue time).

The CD is upside down, cannot be read, does 
not contain audio files or contains audio files of 
a format not recognised by the audio system.
The CD has been recorded in a format that is 
not compatible with the player (udf,...).
The CD is protected by an anti-pirating system 
not recognised by the audio system.

There is a long waiting period following the 
insertion of a CD or connection of a USB 
memory stick.

Upon insertion of a new key, the system reads 
a certain amount of data (directory, title, artist, 
etc.). This may take from a few seconds to a few 
minutes.

The CD sound is of poor quality.

The CD used is scratched or of poor quality.

Some information characters in the currently 
playing media are not displayed correctly.

Playback of streaming files does not start.

Names of tracks and playing time are not 
displayed on the audio streaming screen.

40

The audio settings (bass, treble, ambience) are 
unsuitable.
The audio system does not display some types 
of characters.

The connected device does not automatically 
launch playback.
The Bluetooth profile does not allow the transfer 
of this information.

SOLUTION
Delete the files supplied with the memory stick 
and limit the number of sub-folders in the file 
structure on the memory stick.

Check that the CD is inserted in the player the 
right way up.
Check the condition of the CD: the CD cannot 
be played if it is too badly damaged.
Check the content in the case of a recorded CD: 
consult the advice in the "AUDIO" section.
The audio system CD does not read DVDs.
Due to insufficient quality, certain burned CDs 
will not be read by the audio system.
This is perfectly normal.

Insert good quality CDs and store them in 
suitable conditions.
Return bass and treble settings to 0, without 
selecting an ambience.
Use standard characters to name tracks and 
folders.

Start playback from the device.

PEUGEOT Connect NavTelephone

QUESTION
I cannot connect my Bluetooth telephone.

RESPONSE
The telephone's Bluetooth function may be 
switched off or the telephone may not be visible.

SOLUTION
Check that your telephone has Bluetooth 
switched on.
Check in the telephone settings that it is "visible 
to all".

The Bluetooth telephone is not compatible with 
the system.

You can check the compatibility of your 
telephone on the Brand's website (services).

The volume of the telephone connected in 
Bluetooth mode is inaudible.

The sound depends on both the system and the 
telephone.

Increase the volume of the audio system, to 
maximum if required, and increase the volume 
of the telephone if necessary.

Some contacts are duplicated in the list.

Ambient noise affects the quality of the 
telephone call.

Reduce the ambient noise level (close the windows, 
reduce the booster fan speed, slow down, ...).

The options for synchronising contacts are 
synchronising the contacts on the SIM card, the 
contacts on the telephone, or both. When both 
synchronisations are selected, some contacts 
may be duplicated.

Select "Display SIM card contacts" or "Display 
telephone contacts".

The contacts are listed in alphabetical order.

Some telephones offer display options. 
Depending on the settings chosen, contacts can 
be transferred in a specific order.

Modify the telephone directory display settings.

The system does not receive SMS.

The Bluetooth mode does not permit sending 
SMS text messages to the system.

QUESTION
When changing the setting of treble and bass, 
the equalizer setting is deselected.
When changing the equalizer setting, the treble 
and bass settings are reset.

When changing the balance setting, distribution 
is deselected.
When changing the distribution setting, the 
balance setting is deselected.

There is a difference in sound quality between 
the different audio sources.

RESPONSE
The selection of an equalizer setting imposes 
the settings for treble and bass and vice-versa.

SOLUTION
Modify the treble and bass or equalizer settings 
to obtain the desired musical ambience.

The selection of a distribution setting imposes 
the balance settings and vice-versa.

Modify the balance setting or the distribution 
setting to obtain the desired sound quality.

To allow for optimal listening quality, the 
audio settings can be tailored to different 
sound sources, which can generate audible 
differences when changing source.

Check that the audio settings are adapted to 
the sources listened to. It is recommended 
that the audio settings (Bass, Treble, Balance) 
be adjusted to the middle position, select the 
"None" musical ambience and set the loudness 
correction to the "Active" position in CD mode or 
to the "Inactive" position in radio mode.

Turn the ignition on to increase the charge of 
the battery.

When the engine is off, the system stops after 
several minutes of use.

When the engine is switched off, the system's 
operating time depends on the state of charge 
of the battery.
In normal off state, the system automatically 
goes into energy economy mode to maintain an 
adequate charge in the battery.

The date and time cannot be set.

Setting of the date and time is only available 
if the synchronisation with the satellites is 
deactivated.

Settings menu / Options / Time-Date setting. 
Select the "Time" tab and deactivate the "GPS 
synchronisation" (UTC).

Frequently asked 
questions
The following information groups together the 
answers to the most frequently asked questions 
concerning your audio system.

21

.PEUGEOT Connect RadioRadio

QUESTION
The reception quality of the tuned radio station 
gradually deteriorates or the stored stations are 
not working (no sound, 87.5 Mhz is displayed ...).

RESPONSE
The vehicle is too far from the transmitter of 
the station or no transmitter is present in the 
geographical area.

SOLUTION
Activate the "RDS" function by means of the 
upper band to enable the system to check 
whether there is a more powerful transmitter in 
the geographical area.

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, 
basement car parks...) block reception, including 
in RDS mode.

This phenomenon is normal and does not 
indicate a failure of the audio equipment.

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for 
example when going through a car wash or into 
an underground car park).

Have the aerial checked by a Brand dealer.

I cannot find some radio stations in the list of 
received stations.
The name of the radio station changes.

The station is not received or has changed its 
name in the list.

Press the round arrow on the "List" tab of the 
"Radio" page.

Some radio stations send other information 
in place of their name (the title of the song for 
example).
The system interprets these details as the 
station name.

22

PEUGEOT Connect RadioMedia

QUESTION
Playback of my USB memory stick starts only 
after a very long wait (around 2 to 3 minutes).

RESPONSE
Some files supplied with the memory stick 
may greatly slow down access to reading 
the memory stick (multiplication by 10 of the 
catalogue time).

SOLUTION
Delete the files supplied with the memory stick 
and limit the number of sub-folders in the file 
structure on the memory stick.

Some information characters in the currently 
playing media are not displayed correctly.

The audio system does not display some types 
of characters.

Use standard characters to name tracks and 
folders.

Playback of streaming files does not start.

The connected device does not automatically 
launch playback.

Start playback from the device.

Names of tracks and playing time are not 
displayed on the audio streaming screen.

The Bluetooth profile does not allow the transfer 
of this information.

23

.PEUGEOT Connect RadioTelephone

QUESTION
I cannot connect my Bluetooth telephone.

RESPONSE
The telephone's Bluetooth function may be 
switched off or the telephone may not be visible.

SOLUTION
Check that your telephone has Bluetooth 
switched on.
Check in the telephone settings that it is "visible 
to all".

The Bluetooth telephone is not compatible with 
the system.

You can check the compatibility of your 
telephone on the Brand's website (services).

The volume of the telephone connected in 
Bluetooth mode is inaudible.

The sound depends on both the system and the 
telephone.

Increase the volume of the audio system, to 
maximum if required, and increase the volume 
of the telephone if necessary.

Ambient noise affects the quality of the 
telephone call.

Reduce the ambient noise level (close the 
windows, reduce the booster fan speed, slow 
down, ...).

The contacts are listed in alphabetical order.

Some telephones offer display options. 
Depending on the settings chosen, contacts can 
be transferred in a specific order.

Modify the telephone directory display settings.

24

PEUGEOT Connect RadioSettings

QUESTION
When changing the setting of treble and bass, 
the equalizer setting is deselected.
When changing the equalizer setting, the treble 
and bass settings are reset.

When changing the balance setting, distribution 
is deselected.
When changing the distribution setting, the 
balance setting is deselected.

There is a difference in sound quality between 
the different audio sources.

RESPONSE
The selection of an equalizer setting imposes 
the settings for treble and bass and vice-versa.

SOLUTION
Modify the treble and bass or equalizer settings 
to obtain the desired musical ambience.

The selection of a distribution setting imposes 
the balance settings and vice-versa.

Modify the balance setting or the distribution 
setting to obtain the desired sound quality.

To allow for optimal listening quality, the 
audio settings can be tailored to different 
sound sources, which can generate audible 
differences when changing source.

Check that the audio settings are adapted to the 
sources listened to. Adjust the audio functions 
to the middle position.

When the engine is off, the system stops after 
several minutes of use.

When the engine is switched off, the system's 
operating time depends on the state of charge 
of the battery.
Stopping is normal; the system automatically 
goes into energy economy mode to maintain an 
adequate charge in the battery.

Turn the ignition on to increase the charge of 
the battery.
