SEAT BELTS (1/4)
Always wear your seat belt when trav-
elling  in  your  vehicle.  You  must  also 
comply with the legislation of the par-
ticular country you are in.

Before starting, first adjust your driv-
ing position, then ask all occupants 
to adjust their seat belts to ensure 
optimum protection.

Incorrectly  adjusted  or 
twisted  seat  belts  may 
cause injuries in the event 
of an accident.

Use  one  seat  belt  per  person, 
whether child or adult.
Even pregnant women should wear 
a seat belt. In this case, ensure that 
the lap belt is not exerting too much 
pressure  on  the  abdomen,  but  do 
not allow any slack.

Adjusting your driving 
position
–  Sit well back in your seat (having 
first  removed  your  coat  or  jacket). 
This is essential to ensure your back 
is positioned correctly;

–  adjust  the  distance  between  the 
seat  and  the  pedals.  Your  seat 
should  be  as  far  back  as  possible 
while  still  allowing  you  to  depress 
the clutch pedal fully. The seatback 
should be adjusted so that your arms 
are slightly bent when you hold the 
steering wheel;

–  adjust the position of your head-
rest. For the maximum safety, your 
head must be as close as possible to 
the headrest;

–  adjust the height of the seat. This 
adjustment allows you to select the 
seat  position  which  offers  you  the 
best possible view;

–  adjust the position of the steering 

wheel.

1

2

Adjusting the seat belts
Sit  with  your  back  firmly  against  the 
seatback.
Shoulder strap 1 should be as close as 
possible to the base of the neck but not 
on it.
Lap belt 2 should be worn flat over the 
thighs and against the pelvis.
The  belt  should  be  worn  so  that  it  is 
as close as possible to your body, i.e.: 
avoid wearing heavy clothing or keep-
ing bulky objects under the belts, etc.

ing on buckle 3).
If the belt jams, allow it to return slightly 
before attempting to unwind it again.
If your seat belt is completely jammed, 
pull slowly, but firmly, so that just over 
3 cm unwinds. Allow it to return slightly 
before attempting to unwind it again.
If there is still a problem, contact an ap-
proved dealer.

SEAT BELTS (4/4)
The following information applies to the vehicle’s front and rear seat belts.

–  No modification may be made to the component parts of the originally fitted restraint system: seat belts, seats and 

their mountings. For special operations (e.g. fitting child seats), contact an authorised dealer.

– Do not use devices which allow any slack in the belts (e.g. clothes pegs, clips, etc.): a seat belt which is worn too 
loosely may cause injury in the event of an accident.

–  Never wear the shoulder strap under your arm or behind your back.
–  Never use the same belt for more than one person and never hold a baby or child on your lap with your seat belt around 

them.

–  The belt should never be twisted.
–  Following an accident, have the seat belts checked and replaced if necessary. Always replace your seat belts as soon as 

they show any signs of wear.

–  Make sure that the buckle is inserted into the appropriate catch.
–  Ensure that no objects are placed in the area around the seat belt catch as they could prevent it from being properly se-

cured.

–  Make sure the seat belt catch is properly positioned (it should not be hidden away, crushed or flattened by people or ob-

jects).

1.26

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS (1/4)
Depending  on  the  vehicle,  they  are 
composed of:
–  seat  belt  inertia  reel  pretension-

ers;

–  driver’s lap belt pretensioners;
–  chest-level load limiter;
–  airbags  driver  and  passenger 

front.

These systems are designed to act in-
dependently or together when the vehi-
cle is subjected to a frontal impact.
Depending  on  the  severity  of  the 
impact, the system can trigger:
–  seat belt locking;
–  the seat belt inertia reel pretensioner 
(which engages to correct seat belt 
slack);

–  the lap belt pretensioners to hold the 

occupant in his seat;

–  the front airbag.

1

2

Pretensioners
The  pretensioners  hold  the  seat  belt 
against the body, holding the occupant 
more securely against the seat, thus in-
creasing the seat belt’s efficiency.
In the event of a severe frontal impact 
and if the ignition is switched on, the 
system may engage the following de-
pending on the force of the impact:
–  seat belt inertia reel pretensioner 1 
which instantly retracts the seat belt;
–  the  lap  belt  pretensioner  2  for  the 

driver only.

–  Have  the  entire  restraint 
system checked following 
an accident.

– No  operation  whatso-
ever  is  permitted  on  any  part 
of  the  system  (pretensioners, 
airbags, computers, wiring) and 
the system components must not 
be reused on any other vehicle, 
even if identical.

–  To  avoid  incorrect  triggering  of 
the  system  which  may  cause 
injury,  only  qualified  personnel 
from  an  approved  dealer  may 
work on the pretensioner and air 
bag system.

–  The electric trigger system may 
only  be  tested  by  a  specially 
trained  technician  using  special 
equipment.

–  When  the  vehicle  is  scrapped, 
contact  an  approved  dealer  for 
disposal of the pretensioner and 
airbags gas generators.

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS (2/4)
Load limiter
Above a certain severity of impact, this 
mechanism is used to limit the force of 
the belt against the body so that it is at 
an acceptable level.

driver and passenger front 
Airbags
Fitted  to  the  driver  and  passenger 
sides.
The presence of this equipment is indi-
cated by the word “Airbag” on the steer-
ing wheel, dashboard (in area airbag A) 
and, depending on the vehicle, a label 
on the lower section of the windscreen.
Each airbag system consists of:
–  an airbag and gas generator fitted on 
the steering wheel for the driver and 
in the dashboard for the passenger;
–  an electronic unit for system monitor-
ing which controls the gas generator 
electrical trigger system;
–  a single å warning light on the 
instrument panel.

A

The airbag system uses py-
rotechnic  principles.  This 
explains  why,  when  the 
airbag inflates, it will gener-
ate heat, produce smoke (this does 
not mean that a fire is about to start) 
and make a banging noise. In a situ-
ation where an airbag is required, it 
will inflate immediately and this may 
cause some minor, superficial graz-
ing to the skin or other problems.

1.28

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS (3/4)

Operating faults
This warning light å will light up on 
the instrument panel when the ignition 
is switched on and then go out after a 
few seconds.
If it does not light up when the ignition 
is switched on, or comes on when the 
engine is running, there is a fault in the 
system.
Contact your approved Dealer as soon 
as possible. Your protection will be re-
duced until this fault is rectified.

Operation
This system is only operational when 
the ignition is switched on.
In a severe frontal impact, the airbags 
inflate  rapidly,  cushioning  the  impact 
of the driver's head and chest against 
the steering wheel and of the front pas-
senger against the dashboard. The air-
bags then deflate immediately so that 
the passengers are not in any way hin-
dered from leaving the vehicle.

1.29

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS (4/4)
All of the warnings below are given so that the airbag is not obstructed in any way when it is inflated and also to prevent 
the risk of serious injuries caused by items which may be dislodged when it inflates.

Warnings concerning the driver’s airbag
– Do not modify the steering wheel or the steering wheel boss.
– Do not cover the steering wheel boss under any circumstances.

–  Do not attach any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the steering wheel boss.
–  The steering wheel must not be removed (except by qualified personnel from our Network).
–  When driving, do not sit too close to the steering wheel. Sit with your arms slightly bent (see the information on “Adjusting 

your driving position” in Section 1). This will allow sufficient space for the air bag to deploy correctly and be fully effective.

Warnings concerning the passenger airbag
–  Do not attach or glue any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the dashboard on or near the airbag.
–  Do not place anything between the dashboard and the passenger (pet, umbrella, walking stick, parcels, etc.).
–  The passenger must not put his or her feet on the dashboard or seat as there is a risk that serious injuries may occur. In 

general, parts of the body should be kept away from the dashboard (knees, hands, head, etc.).

–  The devices in addition to the front passenger seat belt should be reactivated as soon as a child seat is removed, to ensure 

the protection of the passenger in the event of an impact.

A REAR-FACING CHILD SEAT MUST NOT BE FITTED TO THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNLESS 

THE ADDITIONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS, IE. THE PASSENGER AIR BAG, ARE DEACTIVATED.

(refer to the information on “Child safety: deactivating/activating the front passenger airbag” in Section 1)

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE REAR SIDE SEAT BELTS
Force limiter
Above a certain severity of impact, this 
mechanism is used to limit the force of 
the belt against the body so that it is at 
an acceptable level.

–  Have  the  entire  restraint 
system checked following 
an accident.

– No operation whatsoever 
is  permitted  on  any  part  of  the 
system (air bags, electronic con-
trol units, wiring) and the system 
components must not be reused 
on any other vehicle, even if iden-
tical.

–  Only  qualified  personnel  from 
our Network may work on the air 
bags; otherwise the system may 
trigger  accidentally  and  cause 
injury.

1.31

SIDE PROTECTION DEVICES
Side Airbags
An  airbag  can  be  fitted  to  each  front 
seat and the rear side seats, which are 
deployed on the side of the seat (door 
side)  to  protect  the  occupants  in  the 
case of a severe side impact.

Curtain Airbags
These are airbag fitted along the sides 
of the vehicle in the ceiling which trigger 
along the front and rear door side win-
dows to protect the passengers in case 
of a severe side impact.

Depending on the vehicle, a mark-
ing on the windscreen informs you 
of the presence of additional means 
of restraint (air bags, pretensioners, 
etc.) in the passenger compartment.

1.32

Warning relating to the side airbag 
– Fitting seat covers: seats equipped with an airbag require covers spe-
cifically designed for your vehicle. Contact an approved Dealer to find out 
if these covers are available. The use of any covers other than those de-
signed for your vehicle (and including those designed for another vehicle) may 
affect the operation of the airbags and reduce your protection.

–  Do not place any accessories, objects or even pets between the seatback, the 
door and the internal fittings. Do not cover the seatback with any items such as 
clothes or accessories. This may prevent the air bag from operating correctly 
or cause injury when the airbag is deployed.

–  No work or modification whatsoever may be carried out on the seat or internal 

fittings, except by qualified personnel from an approved Dealer.

Operating faults
å  This  warning  light  comes  on 
when  the  engine  is  started  and  then 
goes out after approximately three se-
conds.
If it does not come on when the ignition 
is switched on or if it stays on, there is a 
fault in the system.
Contact your approved Dealer as soon 
as possible.
Your protection will be reduced until this 
fault is rectified.

ADDITIONAL METHODS OF RESTRAINT
All of the warnings below are given so that the airbag is not obstructed in any 
way when it is inflated and also to prevent the risk of serious injuries caused 
by items which may be dislodged when it inflates.

The airbag is designed to complement the action of the seat belt. Both the 
air bags and seat belts are integral parts of the same protection system. 
It is therefore essential to wear seat belts at all times. If seat belts are not 
worn, the occupants are exposed to the risk of serious injury in the event 
of an accident. It may also increase the risk of minor superficial injuries occurring 
when the airbag is deployed, although such minor injuries are always possible 
with air bags.
If the vehicle should overturn or in the event of a rear impact, however severe, 
the pretensioners and airbags are not always triggered. Impacts to the underside 
of the vehicle, e.g. from pavements, potholes or stones, can all trigger these sys-
tems.
–  No work or modification whatsoever may be carried out on any part of the 
airbag system (airbags, pretensioners, computer, wiring harness, etc.), except 
by qualified Network personnel.

–  To ensure that the system is in good working order and to avoid accidental trig-
gering of the system which may cause injury, only qualified Network personnel 
may work on the airbag system.

–  As a safety precaution, have the airbag system checked if your vehicle has 

been involved in an accident, or is stolen or broken into.

–  When selling or lending the vehicle, inform the user of these points and hand 

over this handbook with the vehicle.

–  When scrapping your vehicle, contact your approved Dealer for disposal of the 

gas generator(s).

CHILD SAFETY: General information (1/2)
Carrying children
Please ensure that you comply with the 
legislation of your country.
Children, and adults, must be correctly 
seated and strapped in for all journeys. 
The children being carried in your vehi-
cle are your responsibility.
A child is not a miniature adult. Children 
are at risk of specific injuries as their 
muscles  and  bones  have  not  yet  fin-
ished  growing.  The  seat  belt  alone 
would not provide suitable protection. 
Use an approved child seat and ensure 
you use it correctly.

A  collision  at  30  mph 
(50 km/h) is the same as fall-
ing a distance of 10 metres. 
Transporting a child without 
a restraint is the equivalent of allow-
ing him or her to play on a fourth-
floor balcony without railings.
Never travel with a child held in your 
arms. In the event of an accident, 
you will not be able to keep hold of 
the  child,  even  if  you  yourself  are 
wearing a seat belt.
If your vehicle has been involved in 
a  road  accident,  replace  the  child 
seat  and  have  the  seat  belts  and 
ISOFIX anchorage points checked.

To prevent the doors being 
opened,  use  the  “Child 
safety” device (refer to the 
information  on  “Opening 
and closing the doors” in Section 1).

1.34

Driver’s  responsibility 
when parking or stopping 
the vehicle
Never  leave  an  animal, 
child or adult who is not self-suffi-
cient alone on your vehicle, even for 
a short time.
They may pose a risk to themselves 
or to others by starting the engine, 
activating  equipment  such  as  the 
electric  windows  or  by  locking  the 
doors.
Also, in hot and/or sunny weather, 
please remember that the tempera-
ture inside the passenger compart-
ment increases very quickly.
RISK  OF  DEATH  OR  SERIOUS 
INJURY.

CHILD SAFETY: General information (2/2)
Using a child seat
The level of protection offered by the 
child seat depends on its ability to re-
strain your child and on its installation. 
Incorrect installation compromises the 
protection it offers the child in the event 
of harsh braking or an impact.
Before purchasing a child seat, check 
that it complies with the regulations for 
the country you are in and that it can 
be fitted in your vehicle. Consult an ap-
proved dealer to find out which seats 
are recommended for your vehicle.
Before  fitting  a  child  seat,  read  the 
manual and respect its instructions. If 
you  experience  any  difficulties  during 
installation,  contact  the  manufacturer 
of the equipment. Keep the instructions 
with the seat.

Set a good example by always fas-
tening your seat belt and teaching 
your child:
–  to strap themselves in correctly;
–  to always get in and out of the car 
at the kerb, away from busy traf-
fic.

Do  not  use  a  second-hand  child 
seat  or  one  without  an  instruction 
manual.
Check that there are no objects in 
the vicinity of the child seat which 
could impede its operation.

Never  leave  a  child  unat-
tended in the vehicle.
Check  that  your  child  is 
always strapped in and that 
the  belt  or  safety  harness  used  is 
correctly  set  and  adjusted.  Avoid 
wearing bulky clothing which could 
cause the belts to slacken.
Never let your child put their head or 
arms out of the window.
Check that the child is in the correct 
position for the entire journey, espe-
cially if asleep.

CHILD SAFETY: choosing a child seat

Rear-facing child seats
A baby’s head is, proportionally, heavier 
than that of an adult and its neck is very 
fragile. Transport  the  child  in  this  po-
sition for as long as possible (until the 
age of 2 at the very least). It supports 
both the head and the neck.
Choose a bucket type seat for best side 
protection and change it as soon as the 
child’s head is higher than the shell.

Forward-facing child seats
The child’s head and abdomen need to 
be protected as a priority. A forward-fac-
ing child seat which is firmly attached to 
the vehicle will reduce the risk of impact 
to the head. Ensure your child travels in 
a forward-facing seat with a harness for 
as long as their size permits.
Choose a bucket type seat for optimum 
side protection.

Booster cushions
From  15  kg  or  4  years,  the  child  can 
travel using a booster seat, which will 
enable  the  seat  belt  to  be  adapted 
to  suit  his/her  size  and  shape.  The 
booster seat cushion must be fitted with 
guides to position the seat belt on the 
child’s thighs rather than the stomach. 
It is recommended that you use a seat-
back fitted with a belt strap guide which 
can be adjusted in terms of height to 
position the seat belt in the centre of the 
shoulder. It must never rest on the neck 
or on the arm.
Choose a bucket type seat for optimum 
side protection.

1.36

Before  using  an  ISOFIX 
child  seat  that  you  pur-
chased for another vehicle, 
check that its installation is 
authorised.  Consult  the  list  of  ve-
hicles which can be fitted with the 
seat from the equipment manufac-
turer.

CHILD SAFETY: choosing a child seat mounting (1/2)
There are two ways of attaching child 
seats:  via  the  seat  belt  or  using  the 
ISOFIX system.
Attachment via the seat belt
The  seat  belt  must  be  adjusted  to 
ensure that it is effective in the event of 
harsh braking or an impact.
Ensure  that  the  strap  paths  indicated 
by the child seat manufacturer are re-
spected.
Always check that the seat belt is cor-
rectly  fastened  by  pulling  it  up,  then 
pulling it out fully whilst pressing on the 
child seat.
Check that the seat is correctly held by 
moving  it  from  side  to  side  and  back 
to front: the seat should  remain firmly 
fixed.
Check that the child seat has not been 
installed at an angle and that it is not 
resting against a window.

The  seat  belt  must  never 
be  twisted  or  the  tension 
relieved.  Never  pass  the 
shoulder  strap  under  the 

arm or behind the back.
Check  that  the  seat  belt  has  not 
been damaged by sharp edges.
If the seat belt does not operate nor-
mally,  it  will  not  protect  the  child. 
Consult an approved dealer. Do not 
use this seat until the seat belt has 
been repaired.

Do  not  use  the  child  seat 
if it may unfasten the seat 
belt restraining it: the base 
of the seat must not rest on 
the buckle and/or catch of the seat 
belt.

Attachment using the ISOFIX 
system
Authorised ISOFIX child seats are ap-
proved  in  accordance  with  regulation 
ECE-R44 in one of the three following 
scenarios:
–  ISOFIX  universal  3-point  forward-

facing seat;

–  ISOFIX semi-universal 2-point seat;
–  specific.
For the latter two, check that your child 
seat can be installed by consulting the 
list of compatible vehicles.
Attach the child seat with the ISOFIX 
locks, if these are provided. The ISOFIX 
system allows quick, easy, safe fitting.
The ISOFIX system consists of 2 rings 
and, in some cases, a third ring.

No  modifications  may  be 
made  to  the  component 
parts of the restraint system 
(ISOFIX  seat  belts,  seats 
and their mountings) originally fitted.

1.37

The rings are located on the rear seat-
backs and indicated by the symbol .
In all cases, attach the strap hook to the 
corresponding ring 2 and 3 and place 
the seat in the desired position.
Pull the belt so that the back of the child 
seat comes into contact with the back 
of the vehicle seat.

The third ring 2 or 3 is used to attach 
the upper strap on some seats ISOFIX.

Attachment using the ISOFIX 
system (continued)
The  two  rings 1  are  located  between 
the seatback and the seat base of the 
seat and are identified by a marking.
To access the rings, insert your finger in 
the cover and pull.
Note:  Keep  the  covers  you  have  re-
moved in a storage compartment so as 
not to lose or damage them.

The  child  seat  strap must 
be  attached  to  the  corre-
sponding ring.
Do  not  use  any  other 

mounting point.

the 

The 
ISOFIX  anchorage 
points  have  been  exclu-
sively  designed  for  child 
seats  with 
ISOFIX 
system. Never fit a different type of 
child seat, seat belt or other objects 
to  these  anchorage  points.  Check 
that  nothing  is  obstructing  the  an-
chorage points.
If your vehicle has been involved in 
a  road  accident,  have  the  ISOFIX 
anchorage points checked and re-
place your child seat.

1.38

CHILD SAFETY: fitting a child seat, general information (1/2)
Some seats are not suitable for fitting 
child seats. The diagram on the follow-
ing  page  shows  you  how  to  attach  a 
child seat.
The types of child seats indicated may 
not be available. Before using a differ-
ent child seat, check with the manufac-
turer that it can be fitted.

In the front seat
The  laws  concerning  children  travel-
ling in the front passenger seat differ in 
every country. Consult the legislation in 
force and follow the indications on the 
diagram on the following page.
Before fitting a child seat in this seat (if 
authorised):
–  lower the seat belt as far as possible;
–  move the seat as far back as possi-

ble;

–  gently  tilt  the  seatback  away  from 

vertical (approximately 25°);

–  on equipped vehicles, raise the seat 

base as far as possible.

In all situations, reinsert the headrest to 
its full extent so that it does not interfere 
with the child seat (see the information 
on “Front headrests” in Section 1);

Fit the child seat in a rear 
seat wherever possible.
Check that when installing 
the child seat in the vehicle 
it is not at risk of coming loose from 
its base.
If you have to remove the headrest, 
check that it is correctly stored so 
that it does not come loose under 
harsh braking or impact.
Always attach the child seat to the 
vehicle even if it is not in use so that 
it does not come loose under harsh 
braking or impact.

After installing the child seat, when this 
is  possible,  you  can  move  the  vehi-
cle seat forward if necessary (so as to 
leave enough space in the rear seats 
for passengers or other child seats). In 
the case of a rear-facing child seat, do 
not let it touch the dashboard or move it 
to the furthest forward position.
Do not change other settings after in-
stalling the child seat.

RISK  OF  DEATH  OR 
SERIOUS INJURY: before 
fitting  a  rear-facing  child 
seat  to  this  seat,  check 
that  the  air  bag  has  been  deacti-
vated  (refer  to  the  information  on 
“Child  safety:  deactivating/activat-
ing the front passenger air bag” in 
Section 1).

1.39

CHILD SAFETY: fitting a child seat, general information (2/2)
In the rear side seat
A carrycot can be installed across the 
vehicle  and  will  take  up  at  least  two 
seats.
Position the child with their feet nearest 
the door.
Move the front seat as far forward as 
possible  to  install  a  rear-facing  child 
seat, then move back the seat in front 
as far as it will go, although without al-
lowing it to come into contact with the 
child seat.
For the safety of a child facing forwards, 
move the seat in front of the child as 
far  forward  as  possible,  remember-
ing to move the seatback forwards to 
avoid contact between the seat and the 
child’s legs.
In all situations, remove the rear head-
rests  (refer  to  the  information  on  the 
“Rear  headrests”  in  Section  3).  This 
must  be  done  before  fitting  the  child 
seat.
Check that the forward-facing child seat 
is resting against the back of the vehi-
cle seat.

Fit the child seat in a rear 
seat wherever possible.

1.40

Ensure  that  the  child  seat 
or  the  child’s  feet  do  not 
prevent the front seat from 
locking  correctly.  Refer  to 
the information on the “Front seat” 
in Section 1.

When  fitting  a  child  seat 
(Group 2 or 3 booster seat), 
check that the seat belts op-
erate (wind) correctly: refer 
to  Section  1  “Rear  seat  belts”.  If 
necessary, adjust the position of the 
vehicle seat.

CHILD SEATS: attachment by seat belt (1/3)

RISK  OF  DEATH  OR 
SERIOUS INJURY: Before 
installing a child seat on the 
front passenger seat, check 
that  the  airbag  has  been  deacti-
vated (please refer to “Child safety: 
front passenger airbag deactivation 
and activation” in Section 1).

Using a child safety system

Power-assisted steering
Variable power-assisted steering
The  variable  power  assisted  steering 
system is equipped with an electronic 
control system which alters the level of 
assistance to suit the vehicle speed.
Steering is made easier during parking 
manoeuvres (for added comfort) while 
the  force  needed  to  steer  increases 
progressively  as  the  speed  rises  (for 
enhanced safety at high speeds).

1

Adjusting the steering wheel 
height and depth
Lower  the  lever  1  and  position  the 
steering wheel in the required position.
Then, raise the lever fully, beyond the 
point of resistance to lock the steering 
wheel.
Make  sure  that  the  steering  wheel  is 
correctly locked.

For  safety  reasons,  only 
adjust  the  steering  wheel 
when the vehicle is station-
ary.

1.74

Never  leave  the  steering  wheel  at 
full lock while stationary.

With  the  engine  switched  off,  or  if 
there is a system fault, it is still pos-
sible to turn the steering wheel. The 
force required will be greater.

Do not switch off the engine 
when driving downhill and, 
as  a  general  rule,  when 
driving (the power-assisted 
steering and brake cannot operate 
normally).

EXTERIOR LIGHTING AND SIGNALS (2/6)
 Automatic main beam 
Depending on the vehicle, this system 
switches the main beam headlights on 
and off automatically. It uses a camera 
located  behind  the  interior  rear-view 
mirror to detect vehicles that are being 
followed and those coming in the oppo-
site direction.
The main beam headlights come on au-
tomatically if:
–  exterior light is weak;
–  no other vehicles or lighting are de-

tected;

–  the vehicle speed is above approxi-

mately 25 mph (40 km/h).

If any of the above conditions are not 
fulfilled, the system switches to dipped 
beam headlights.

The “automatic main beam 
headlights”  system  should 
under no circumstances be 
used to replace driver atten-
tion  and  responsibility  with  regard 
to  vehicle  lighting  and  adapting  to 
light, visibility and traffic conditions.

The system may encounter difficul-
ties under certain conditions, inclu-
ding:
–  extreme weather conditions (rain, 

snow, fog, etc.);

–  obstruction  in  front  of  the  wind-

screen or camera;

–  when a following or oncoming ve-
hicle has weak or hidden lighting;
–  incorrect  settings  for  the  front 

headlights;

–  reflective systems;
–  ...

REAGENT TANK (1/4)
Please ensure that you comply with the 
legislation of your country.
It is important to remember that failure 
to  respect  regulations  in  force  could 
lead to legal action being taken against 
the vehicle owner.

Operating principle
The reagent is intended for diesel en-
gines fitted with the SCR (selective cat-
alytic reduction) system.
The use of reagents reduces exhaust 
emissions  by  transforming  the  pollut-
ants into water vapour and nitrogen.

Reagent quality
Use  only  reagents  which  conform 
to standard ISO 22241 and in accord-
ance  with  the  mark  on  the  tank  filler 
cap.

1.98

A

Filling
Capacity  of  the  fuel  tank:  3.52  gal 
(16 litres) approximately.
With the ignition switched off, open the 
cover A, then unscrew the cap 1.
Note:  Ammonium  hydroxide  vapour 
may  escape  from  the  cap  opening 
when the tank temperature is high.

Vehicle fitted with the Stop and 
Start function
To  fill  up  with  reagent,  the  engine 
must  be  stopped  (and  not  on 
standby):  stop  the  engine  (please 
see “Starting, stopping the engine” 
in Section 2).

If  the  “XXX  MILES  (XXX 
KM) Failure Top up AdBlue” 
warning message appears, 
fill  the  reagent  tank  and 

refer to the filling instructions.
Risk of immobilisation of the ve-
hicle.

Fuel filler cap: this is spe-
cific.
If  you  have  to  replace  it, 
make  sure  it  is  identical 
to the original cap. Contact an ap-
proved Dealer. Do not wash the filler 
area with a high pressure washer.

REAGENT TANK (2/4)
Precautions for use
When filling, handle the reagent care-
fully.
They  can  damage  clothes,  shoes, 
bodywork components etc.
If  the  reagent  overflows,  or  contami-
nates any paintwork, clean the affected 
area quickly with plenty of cold water 
and a soft cloth.
Note: If the reagent crystallises, use a 
soft sponge.

In extreme cold weather conditions
Fill the reagent tank as soon as pos-
sible  when  the  warning  light  
and  the  message  “Top  up  AdBlue 
before 1200 km” are displayed.
The reagent fluid freezes below about 
-10°C.
In these conditions, do not attempt fill-
ing when the fluid is frozen. In the event 
of  needing  to  top  up  or  fill  the  tank 
with reagent ( on), park the ve-
hicle in a hotter location if possible so 
that the reagent becomes liquid again. 
Otherwise,  have  a  qualified  profes-
sional top up or fill up with reagent fluid.

The reagent must not come 
into  contact  with  eyes  or 
skin. If it does, wash the af-
fected  area  with  plenty  of 
cold water. If necessary, consult a 
doctor.

After filling the reagent tank, check 
that the cap and cover are closed, 
start the engine and WAIT 10 sec-
onds with the vehicle stationary, 
engine  running  before  setting  off 
again.
If this operation is not carried out, 
the  filling  of  the  tank  will  not  be 
taken  into  account  automatically 
until after several dozens of minutes 
of driving.
The  message  “---  Top  up AdBlue” 
and/or  the  warning  lights  will  con-
tinue to appear until the filling has 
been registered by the system.

No  work  whatsoever  is 
permitted  on  any  part  of 
the  system.  To  prevent 
damage, only qualified per-
sonnel from our network may work 
on the system.

–  using leaded petrol;
–  using  fuel  or  lubrication  additives 

which are not approved.
Or operating faults such as:
–  faulty ignition system, running out of 
fuel or disconnected spark plugs re-
sulting in the engine misfiring or cut-
ting out when driving;

–  loss of power,
as  they  may  cause  the  catalytic  con-
verter to overheat and thus reduce its 
efficiency,  or  damage  it  irreparably 
and cause heat damage to the vehi-
cle.

2.12

Starting problems
To  avoid  damaging  the  catalytic  con-
verter, do not keep trying to start the 
engine  (using  the  start  button,  or  by 
pushing or towing the vehicle) without 
having identified and corrected the 
starting fault.
If the fault cannot be identified, do not 
keep trying to start the engine, but con-
tact an approved Dealer.

Do not park the vehicle or 
run the engine in locations 
where  combustible  sub-
stances  or  materials  such 
as  grass  or  leaves  can  come  into 
contact with the hot exhaust system.

If, after approximately 20 minutes, the 
indicator  light  remains  lit,  consult  an 
Approved Dealer.
Note: if the vehicle is stopped before 
the  warning  light  disappears,  you  will 
have to restart the process from the be-
ginning.

SPECIAL FEATURES OF PETROL VERSIONS (2/2)/PARTICLE FILTER
Particle filter
The particle filter is used in the treat-
ment of exhaust gases from petrol en-
gines. 
When driving, depending on the grade 
of  fuel  used,  it  is  possible  that  white 
smoke may be emitted. This is due to 
the exhaust particle filter being cleaned 
automatically, and does not affect the 
way the vehicle runs.
Depending on the vehicle, the warning 
light  displayed on the instrument 
panel indicates that the filter is becom-
ing clogged and requires cleaning. To 
clean it, when the  warning light 
appears, and as traffic conditions and 
speed  limits  allow,  drive  at  between 
about 31 mph (50 km/h) and 68 mph 
(110 km/h) until the light goes out. 
After  between  approximately  5  and 
20 minutes, the warning light should go 
out.

If  the  filter  becomes  saturated,  the 
©  warning  light  and,  depending 
on the vehicle, the  warning light 
will appear on the instrument panel, ac-
companied by the message “Check in-
jection”. In this case, please consult an 
Authorised Dealer.
If the ® warning light and, depend-
ing on the vehicle, the  warning 
light  appears,  accompanied  by  the 
“Engine failure hazard” message, stop 
the vehicle, switch off the engine and 
contact an Approved Dealer.

Warning  light  ®  re-
quires you to stop immedi-
ately,  for  your  own  safety, 
as soon as traffic conditions 
allow. Switch off the engine and do 
not restart it. Contact an approved 
Dealer.

SPECIAL FEATURES OF DIESEL VERSIONS
Diesel engine speed
Diesel engines are fitted with an injec-
tion pump which prevents the engine 
speed being exceeded irrespective of 
the gear selected.
If  the  message  “Check  antipollution 
system” is displayed along with warn-
ing lights Ä and ©, consult an 
authorised dealer immediately.
When  driving,  depending  on  the  fuel 
grade  used,  it  is  possible  that  white 
smoke may be emitted.
This is due to the exhaust particle filter 
being cleaned automatically, and does 
not affect the way the vehicle runs.

Precautions to be taken in 
winter
To avoid any faults in icy weather:
–  ensure that the battery is always fully 

charged,

–  always  keep  the  diesel  tank  rela-
tively full to avoid water vapour con-
densing in it and accumulating at the 
bottom of the tank.

Do not park the vehicle or 
run the engine in locations 
where  combustible  sub-
stances  or  materials  such 
as  grass  or  leaves  can  come  into 
contact with the hot exhaust system.

Running out of fuel
If  the  tank  has  been  completely 
drained, the system must be reprimed 
after  the  tank  is  refilled:  See  “Fuel 
tank” in section 1 before restarting the 
engine.

ELECTRONIC PARKING BRAKE (2/3)

Special cases
To  park  on  a  slope  or  while  towing  a 
trailer,  for  example,  pull  switch  1  for 
a  few  seconds  to  gain  the  maximum 
braking.
To park the vehicle without applying the 
electronic  parking  brake  (if  there  is  a 
risk of freezing, for example):
–  with  the  engine  running,  while  si-
multaneously depressing the brake 
pedal  and  the  switch  1,  stop  the 
engine  (not  standby  for  vehicles 
fitted with Stop and Start);

–  with a gear or position P engaged, 
release  the  brake  pedal  and  the 
switch 1.

For vehicles fitted with a Stop and Start 
function,  with  the  engine  on  standby, 
the electronic parking brake is automat-
ically activated if the driver unfastens 
their  seat  belt  and  opens  the  driver’s

2.18

ELECTRONIC PARKING BRAKE (3/3)

Versions with an automatic 
gearbox
For safety reasons, automatic release 
is  deactivated  when  the  driver’s  door 
is  open  or  not  shut  properly  and  the 
engine is running (in order to prevent 
the  vehicle  from  moving  without  the 
driver).  The  “Release  parking  brake 
manually”  message  appears  on  the 
instrument  panel  when  the  driver  de-
presses the accelerator.

In  the  event  of  message 
“Electric  failure  DANGER” 
or  “Check  battery”,  manu-
ally  activate  the  electronic 
parking brake by pulling switch 1 (or 
position the gear lever in P for au-
tomatic gearboxes) before stopping 
the engine. 
Risk of loss of immobilisation of the 
vehicle.
Contact an authorised dealer.

If  no  lights  or  sounds  are 
apparent,  this  indicates 
a  fault  in  the  instrument 
panel.  This  indicates  that 
it  is  essential  to  stop  immediately 
(as soon as traffic conditions allow). 
Ensure that the vehicle is correctly 
immobilised and contact an appro-
ved Dealer.

Never  leave  your  vehicle 
without moving the selector 
lever to position P. This is 
because  when  the  vehicle 
is stationary with the engine running 
and  a  gear  engaged,  the  vehicle 
may  begin  to  move  if  you  accele-
rate.
There is a risk of accidents.

Operating faults
–  If there is a fault, the © warning 
light  illuminates  on  the  instrument 
panel  accompanied  by  the  “Check 
parking  brake”  message  and,  in 
some  cases,  the  }   warning 
light.
Please contact an authorised dealer 
as soon as possible.

–  If there is an assisted parking brake 
fault, the warning light ® comes 
on, along with the message “Braking 
system fault”, a beep and, in some 
cases, the warning light }.
This  means  that  you  must  stop  as 
soon as traffic conditions allow.

It  is  therefore  essential  to 
immobilise  the  vehicle  by 
engaging first gear (manual 
gearbox) or position P (au-
tomatic  gearbox).  If  the  slope  re-
quires it, chock the vehicle.

2.19

Gear change indicator 2
Depending on the vehicle, to obtain op-
timum  consumption  levels,  a  warning 
light on the instrument panel lets you 
know the best time to move up or down 
a gear:
Š move up a gear;
‰ move down a gear.
If you regularly follow this indicator, you 
will reduce your vehicle’s fuel consump-
tion.

DRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING (1/5)
Fuel consumption is accredited in ac-
cordance  with  a  standard  regulatory 
method.  Identical  for  all  manufactur-
ers,  this  enables  vehicles  to  be  com-
pared with one another. Consumption 
in real time depends on vehicle usage 
conditions, the equipment fitted and the 
user’s  driving  style.  To  optimise  fuel 
consumption, please refer to the follow-
ing advice.
Depending on the vehicle, you will have

formation relating to your last journey.

This indicates:
–  average fuel consumption;
–  number of miles/kilometres travelled;
–  number  of  miles/kilometres  saved. 
This corresponds to driving without 
fuel consumption (deceleration and/
or foot off the accelerator pedal).

An overall rating from 0 to 100 is dis-
played to let you assess your eco driv-
ing performance. The higher the rating, 
the lower the fuel consumption.
Eco  advice  is  given  to  help  improve

DRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING (3/5)
ECO mode
ECO  mode  is  a  function  which  opti-
mises  fuel  consumption.  It  acts  upon 
certain  power  consuming  systems  in 
the  vehicle  (heating,  air  conditioning, 
power-assisted  steering  etc.)  and  on 
certain  driving  actions  (acceleration, 
gear changing, cruise control, deceler-
ation etc.).
Limiting acceleration enables low fuel 
consumption in urban and surrounding 
areas. When ECO mode is in use, it is 
normal to notice a change in the heat-
ing level.
Activating the function
The function can be activated:
–  by pressing switch 4.
–  Depending on the vehicle, from the 
navigation menu on the multimedia 
screen (please refer to the multime-
dia instructions).
The warning light  comes on on 
the instrument panel to confirm activa-
tion.

While driving, it is possible to leave the 
ECO mode temporarily in order to im-
prove engine performance.
For this, depress the accelerator pedal 
firmly and fully.
ECO  mode  is  reactivated  when  you 
take pressure off the accelerator pedal.

2.22

DRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING (4/5)

–  Do not overrev the engine in the in-

termediate gears.

  You should always use the highest 

gear possible.

–  Avoid sudden acceleration.
–  Brake as little as possible. If you an-
ticipate  an  obstacle  or  bend  in  ad-
vance, you may then simply release 
the accelerator pedal.

–  Do  not  try  to  maintain  the  same 
speed up a hill, accelerate no more 
than you would on flat ground. Keep 
your foot in the same position on the 
accelerator pedal.

–  Double declutching and accelerating 
before switching off are unnecessary 
in modern vehicles.

–  Bad weather, flooded roads:

Do  not  drive  through 
floods  if  the  water  is 
above the lower edge of 
the wheel rims.

Obstructions to the driver
On  the  driver’s  side,  only 
use  mats  suitable  for  the 
vehicle,  attached  with  the 
pre-fitted  components,  and  check 
the fitting regularly. Do not lay one 
mat on top of another.
There  is  a  risk  of  wedging  the 
pedals.

2.23

Driving advice, Eco-driving
Behaviour
–  Drive carefully for the first few miles 
until the engine reaches its normal 
operating  temperature,  rather  than 
let it warm up while the vehicle is sta-
tionary.

–  Speed is expensive.
–  Dynamic driving with a lot of frequent 
acceleration  and  braking  is  expen-
sive on fuel in comparison to the time 
saved.

DRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING (5/5)

Tyres
–  An underinflated tyre increases fuel 

consumption.

–  Opt for the highest speed pressure 
or the pressure recommended to op-
timise  fuel  consumption  indicated 
on edge of the driver’s door (please 
refer to the information on “Tyre infla-
tion pressure” in Section 4).

–  The use of non-recommended tyres 

can increase fuel consumption.

Advice on use
–  Favour the ECO mode.
–  Electricity  is  fuel;  switch  off  all  the 
electrical  components  which  are 
not really needed. However (safety 
first), keep your lights on when the 
visibility is bad (“see and be seen”).

–  Use  the  air  vents.  Driving  with  the 
windows open at 60 mph (100 km/h) 
will  increase  fuel  consumption  by 
4%.

–  Never  fill  the  fuel  tank  right  to  the 

brim to avoid overflow.

2.24

–  In  vehicles  fitted  with  air  condi-
tioning,  it  is  normal  to  observe  an 
increase in fuel consumption (espe-
cially in urban conditions) when it is 
used. For vehicles fitted with manual 
air conditioning, switch off the system 
when it is not required.
Recommendations  for  reducing 
consumption and therefore help-
ing to preserve the environment:
If the vehicle has been parked in the 
sun,  open  the  doors  for  a  few  mo-
ments to let the hot air escape before 
starting the engine.

–  Do  not  leave  an  empty  roof  rack 

fitted to the vehicle.

–  It is better to fit a trailer for bulky ob-

–  When  towing  a  caravan,  fit  a  wind 

deflector and adjust it carefully.

–  Avoid using the car for door-to-door 
calls (short journeys with long waits 
in  between)  because  the  engine 
never reaches its normal operating 
temperature.

jects.

MAINTENANCE AND ANTIPOLLUTION ADVICE
Your vehicle complies with criteria for 
recycling and recovering vehicles at the 
end of their service life, which entered 
into force in 2015.
Some parts of your vehicle have there-
fore been designed to facilitate future 
recycling.
These  parts  are  easy  to  remove  so 
that they can be recovered and reproc-
essed by recycling companies.
By  virtue  of  its  design,  moderate  fuel 
consumption  and  initial  settings,  your 
vehicle also conforms to current anti-
pollution  regulations.  The  manufac-
turer is actively striving to reduce pol-
lutant  exhaust  gas  emissions  and  to 
save energy. But the fuel consumption 
of your vehicle and the level of pollutant 
exhaust  gas  emissions  are  also  your 
responsibility.  Ensure  that  it  is  main-
tained and used correctly.

In  addition,  replacing  engine,  fuel 
supply  system  and  exhaust  compo-
nents with parts other than those origi-
nally  recommended  by  the  manufac-
turer may alter your vehicle so that it 
no  longer  complies  with  anti-pollution 
regulations.
Have  your  vehicle  adjusted  and 
checked by an authorised dealer, in ac-
cordance with the instructions given in 
your  maintenance  schedule:  they  will 
have all the equipment necessary for 
ensuring that your vehicle is maintained 
to its original standard.

Engine adjustments
–  Spark  plugs:  for  optimum  condi-
tions of use, output and performance 
the specifications laid down by our 
Design Department must be strictly 
applied.
If the spark plugs have to be changed, 
use the make, type and gap specified 
for your vehicle’s engine. Contact an 
authorised dealer for this.

 

Maintenance
It  is  important  to  remember  that  fail-
ure to respect antipollution regulations 
could lead to legal action being taken 
against the vehicle owner.

–  Ignition and idle speed: no adjust-

ment is needed.

–  Air filter, fuel filter: a choked ele-
ment  will  reduce  efficiency.  It  must 
be replaced.

Exhaust gas monitoring 
system
The exhaust gas monitoring system will 
detect any operating faults in the vehi-
cle’s antipollution system.
If this system malfunctions, toxic sub-
stances  may  be  released  into  the  at-
mosphere or damage may occur.
Ä This  warning  light  on  the  in-
strument panel will indicate if 
there are any faults in the system:
This  lights  up  when  the  ignition  is 
switched  on  and  goes  out  when  the 
engine is started.
–  If it lights up continuously, consult an 
approved Dealer as soon as possi-
ble;

–  if it flashes, reduce the engine speed 
until the light stops flashing. Contact 
an authorised dealer as soon as pos-
sible.
 Refer  to  the  information  on 

“Reagent tank” in Section 1.

ENVIRONMENT
Your  vehicle  has  been  designed  with 
respect for the environment in mind for 
its entire service life: during production, 
use and at the end of its life.
This  commitment  is  illustrated  by  the 
Renault eco² signature.

Manufacture
Your vehicle has been manufactured at 
a factory which complies with a policy 
to  reduce  the  environmental  impact 
on the surrounding areas (reduction of 
water and energy consumption, visual 
and noise pollution, atmospheric emis-
sions and waste water; sorting and re-
using waste).

Emissions
Your  vehicle  has  been  designed  to 
emit  fewer  greenhouse  gases  (CO2) 
while in use, and therefore to consume 
less fuel (eg. 140 g/km, equivalent to 
5.3 l/100 km for a diesel vehicle).
Our vehicles are also equipped with a 
particle filter system including a cata-
lytic converter, an oxygen sensor and 
an  active  carbon  filter  (the  latter  pre-
vents vapour from the fuel tank being 
released into the open air).
For certain diesel vehicles, this system 
also has a particle filter to reduce the 
volume of soot particles emitted.

Please make your own 
contribution towards 
protecting the environment 
too
–  Worn parts replaced in the course of 
routine  vehicle  maintenance  (vehi-
cle battery, oil filter, air filter, batter-
ies, etc.) and oil containers (empty or 
filled with used oil) must be disposed 
of through specialist organisations.

–  At  the  end  of  the  vehicle’s  service 
life,  it  should  be  sent  to  approved 
centres to ensure that it is recycled.
–  In all cases, comply with local legis-

lation.

Recycling
Your  vehicle  is  85%  recyclable  and 
95% recoverable.
To achieve these objectives, many of 
the vehicle components have been de-
signed to enable them to be recycled. 
The  materials  and  structures  have 
been carefully designed to allow these 
components to be easily removed and 
reprocessed by specialist companies.
In  order  to  preserve  raw  material  re-
sources, this vehicle incorporates nu-
merous parts made from recycled plas-
tics or renewable materials (vegetable 
or  animal-derived  materials  such  as 
cotton or wool).

TYRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (1/3)

1

2

3

If the vehicle is equipped with the func-
tion, this system monitors the tyre pres-
sure.

Operating principle
Each wheel (except for the emergency 
spare wheel) has a sensor in the infla-
tion valve which periodically measures 
the tyre pressure.
The system displays the current pres-
sures  on  the  instrument  panel  1  and 
alerts the driver in the event of insuffi-
cient pressure.

Resetting the standard level 
for the tyre pressures
This should be done:
–  when  the  standard  tyre  pressure 
needs  to  be  changed  to  adapt  to 
usage conditions (empty, carrying a 
load, motorway driving, etc.);

–  after  swapping  a  wheel  (however 

this practice is not recommended);

–  after changing a wheel.
It should always be done after checking 
the tyre pressure of all four tyres when 
cold.
Tyre pressures must correspond to the 
current  usage  of  the  vehicle  (empty, 
carrying a load, motorway driving, etc.).

Resetting can also be done from the 
multifunction screen 3 if your vehi-
cle is fitted with a navigation system. 
Select  the  menu  “Vehicle”,  “Tyre 
pressure”.

Resetting procedure
With the ignition on:
–  repeatedly  and  briefly  press  con-
trol 2 to select the tyre pressure dis-
play  and  the  “Tyre  pressure”  func-
tion;

–  press and hold (around 3 seconds) 
the button 2 to launch the reset. The 
flashing tyres followed by the mes-
sages  “Learning  TP  initiated”  and 
then “Tyres location in progress” in-
dicates that the reset request for the 
tyre  pressure  reference  value  has 
been acknowledged.

Reset can take several minutes of driv-
ing.
If  the  resetting  is  followed  by  short 
trips,  the  message  “Tyres  location  in 
progress”  can  remain  displayed  after 
successive restarts.
Note
The standard tyre pressure cannot be 
less than that recommended and indi-
cated on the door frame.

at least one wheel is not fitted with sen-
sors  (e.g.  emergency  spare  wheel). 
Otherwise,  consult  an  authorised 
dealer.

The sudden loss of pressure in a tyre (burst tyre, etc.) cannot be detected by the 
system.

TYRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (3/3)
“Tyres location failure”
This  message  “Tyres  location  failure” 
appears  when  driving  if  one  or  more 
wheels have been fitted with sensors 
not recognised by Renault.
Consult an approved dealer

Readjustment of tyre 
pressures
The  tyre  pressures  should  be  ad-
justed when cold (please refer to the 
label located on the edge of the driver’s 
door). If the tyre pressures cannot be 
checked when the tyres are cold, the 
recommended pressures should be in-
creased by 0.2 to 0.3 bar (3 PSI).
Never deflate a hot tyre.

Replacing wheels/tyres
This  system  requires  specific  equip-
ment  (wheels,  tyres,  hubcaps,  etc.). 
Please see the information on “Tyres” 
in Section 5.
Contact an approved Dealer to fit new 
tyres and to find out about available ac-
cessories compatible with the system 
and  available  from  your  dealer  net-
work: the use of any other accessory 
could affect the correct operation of the 
system or damage a sensor.

Emergency spare wheel
If the vehicle is equipped with an emer- 
gency  spare  wheel,  it  will  not  have  a 
sensor.

Tyre repair product and 
inflation kit
Because  the  valves  are  specially  de-
signed, only use equipment approved 
by the approved network. Please refer 
to “Tyre inflation kit” in Section 5.

Changing a wheel
The system may take sev-
eral minutes depending on 
use for the new wheel po-
sitions and pressures to be recog-
nised; check the tyre pressures after 
all operations.

This  function  is  an  addi-
tional driving aid.
However,  the  function  is 
not intended to replace the 
driver.  It  cannot,  therefore,  under 
any circumstances replace the vig-
ilance  or  the  responsibility  of  the 
driver. Check the tyre pressures, in-
cluding the emergency spare wheel, 
once a month.

DRIVING CORRECTION DEVICES AND AIDS (1/10)
Depending on the vehicle, they will con-
sist of:
–  ABS (anti-lock braking system) ;
–  ESC (electronic stability control) 
with understeer control and trac-
tion control;

–  emergency brake assist;
–  advanced traction control;
–  active emergency braking;
–  hill start assistance.

These functions are an ad-
ditional aid in the event of 
critical  driving  conditions, 
enabling the vehicle behav-
iour to be adapted to suit the driving 
conditions.
The functions do not take the place 
of the driver. They do not increase 
the  vehicle’s  limits  and  should 
not encourage you to drive more 
quickly. Therefore, they can under 
no circumstances replace the vigi-
lance or responsibility of the driver 
when manoeuvring the vehicle (the 
driver  must  always  be  ready  for 
sudden incidents which may occur 
when driving).

2.30

ABS (anti-lock braking 
system)
Under heavy braking, the ABS prevents 
the  wheels  from  locking,  allowing  the 
stopping distance to be managed and 
keeping control of the vehicle.
Under these circumstances, the vehi-
cle can be steered to avoid an obstacle 
whilst braking. In addition, this system 
can increase stopping distances, par-
ticularly on roads with low surface grip 
(wet ground etc.).
You  will  feel  a  pulsation  through  the 
brake  pedal  each  time  the  system  is 
activated. The ABS does not in any way 
improve the vehicle's physical perform-
ance relating to the road surface and 
roadholding. It is still essential to follow 
the rules of good driving practice (such 
as driving at a safe distance from the 
vehicle in front etc.).

In  an  emergency,  apply  firm  and 
continuous pressure to the brake 
pedal.  There  is  no  need  to  pump 
it  repeatedly.  The ABS  will  modu-
late the force applied in the braking 
system.

DRIVING CORRECTION DEVICES AND AIDS (3/10)
Electronic stability control 
ESC with understeer control 
and traction control
Electronic stability control ESC
This system helps you to keep control 
of the vehicle in critical driving condi-
tions (avoiding an obstacle, loss of grip 
on a bend, etc.).
Operating principle
A sensor in the steering wheel detects 
the direction selected by the driver.
Other  sensors  throughout  the  vehicle 
measure the actual direction.
The  system  compares  driver  input  to 
the actual trajectory of the vehicle and 
corrects the trajectory if necessary by 
controlling the braking of certain wheels 
and/or engine power. In the event that 
the system is engaged, indicator light 
 flashes on the instrument panel.

Understeer control
This system optimises the action of the 
ESC in the case of pronounced under-
steer (loss of front axle road holding).
Traction control
This system helps to limit wheelspin of 
the drive wheels and to control the ve-
hicle when pulling away accelerating or 
decelerating.
Operating principle
Using  the  wheel  sensors,  the  system 
measures and compares the speed of 
the drive wheels at all times and slows 
down their over-rotation. If a wheel is 
starting to slip, the system brakes au-
tomatically until the drive supplied be-
comes compatible with the level of grip 
under the wheel again.
The  system  also  adjusts  the  engine 
speed  to  the  grip  available  under  the 
wheels, independently of the pressure 
exerted on the accelerator pedal.

2.32

DRIVING CORRECTION DEVICES AND AIDS (4/10)

The traction control system offers ad-
ditional safety. It is recommended that 
you  do  not  drive  with  the  function  di-
sabled.  Correct  this  as  soon  as  pos-
sible by pressing the switch 1 again.
Note: The function is reactivated auto-
matically when the ignition is switched 
on or when a speed of approximately 
24 mph (40 km/h) is exceeded.

Emergency brake assist
This  system  supplements  the  ABS 
and helps reduce vehicle stopping dis-
tances.
Operating principle
The  system  detects  an  emergency 
braking situation. In this case, the brak-
ing  assistance  immediately  develops 
maximum power and may trigger ABS 
regulation. ABS braking is maintained 
as  long  as  the  brake  pedal  is  not  re-
leased.
Hazard warning lights illumination
Depending on the vehicle, these may 
light up in the event of sudden decel-
eration.

Deactivating the function
(depending on vehicle)
In some situations (driving on very wet 
ground: snow, mud, etc. or driving with 
snow  chains  fitted),  the  system  may 
reduce the engine output to limit wheel-
spin. If this is not required, it is possible 
to deactivate the function by pressing 
switch 1.
The message “TRACTION CONTROL 
OFF”  is  displayed  on  the  instrument 
panel to inform you.

These functions are an ad-
ditional aid in the event of 
critical  driving  conditions, 
enabling the vehicle behav-
iour to be adapted to suit the driving 
conditions.
The functions do not take the place 
of the driver. They do not increase 
the  vehicle’s  limits  and  should 
not encourage you to drive more

Advanced traction control
If  fitted  on  the  vehicle,  grip  control 
makes it easier to control the vehicle on 
low grip surfaces (soft ground, etc.).

For your safety, please re-
spect the speed limit.
When  they  need  to  be  re-
placed,  only  tyres  of  the 
same make, size, type and profile 
should be used on a single axle.
They must: either have a load ca-
pacity and speed rating at least 
equal  to  those  of  the  original 
tyres, or conform to those recom-
mended by an authorised dealer.
Failure  to  heed  these  instructions 
could  endanger  your  safety  and 
affect  your  vehicle’s  roadworthi-

If the driver depresses the brake pedal 
and the system still detects a risk of col-
lision, the brake force is increased.
If  the  driver  fails  to  react  following 
an  alert  of  an  imminent  collision,  the 
system activates the brakes.

Active emergency braking
Using the sensor 3, the system calcu-
lates the distance separating the vehi-
cle from the one in front and alerts the 
driver if there is a risk of a front-end col-
lision. The driver can then brake the ve-
hicle to limit the damage arising from a 
collision.
Note: make sure that the radar 3 is not 
obscured (by dirt, mud, snow etc. or by 
the fitting of accessories such as bull 
bars).

Operation
While driving (at speeds of between 20 
and 85 mph (30 and 140 km/h)), if there 
is a risk of collision with the vehicle in 
front,  the  warning  light  4  will  be  dis-
played on the instrument panel in red, 
alongside a beep.

The  system  only  detects  vehicles 
driving in the same direction of traf-
fic. The system cannot detect mo-
torcycles because of the difficulty in 
forecasting their trajectory.

Active emergency braking
This function is an additional driving aid. However, this function is not 
under any circumstances intended to replace the due care and attention 
of the driver, who should at all times be in control of the vehicle.

System servicing/repairs
–  In the event of an impact, the sensor alignment may become changed, and its 
operation will consequently be affected. Deactivate the function, then consult 
an authorised dealer.

–  Any work in the area where the radar is located (repairs, replacements, touch-

ing up of paintwork) must be carried out by a qualified professional.

–  Fitting accessories which may block the radar is prohibited (bull bars etc.).
Only an authorised dealer is qualified to service the system.
In the event of system disturbance
Some conditions can disturb or damage the operation of the system, such as:
–  a complex environment (metal bridge, etc.);
–  poor weather conditions (snow, hail, black ice, etc.).

Limitation of the system operation
– The system will only respond to vehicles which are moving or which have been sensed as moving.
–  A vehicle travelling in the opposite direction will not trigger any alert or any action on the system operation.
–  The sensor area should be kept clean and free of any modifications in order to ensure the proper operation of the system.
–  The system cannot respond to small vehicles such as motorbikes or bicycles as effectively as to other vehicles.
Deactivating the function
The function should be deactivated if:
–  the brake lights are not functioning;
–  the front of the vehicle has undergone an impact or been damaged;
–  the vehicle is being towed (breakdowns).
Halting the function
You can halt the active braking function at any time by tapping the accelerator pedal.

Hill start assistance
Depending  on  the  gradient  of  the  in-
cline,  this  system  assists  the  driver 
when starting on a hill. It prevents the 
vehicle from rolling backwards by au-
tomatically  applying  the  brakes  when 
the driver lifts his/her foot off the brake 
pedal to depress the accelerator pedal.
System operation
It only operates when the gear lever is 
in a position other than neutral (other 
than  N  or  P  for  automatic  transmis-
sions)  and  the  vehicle  is  completely 
stationary (brake pedal depressed)
The  system  holds  the  vehicle  for  ap-
proximately 2 seconds. The brakes are 
then released (the vehicle will move ac-
cording to the slope).

The  hill  start  assistance 
system  cannot  completely 
prevent  the  vehicle  from 
rolling backwards in all sit-
uations (extremely steep gradients, 
etc.).
In all cases, the driver may depress 
the brake pedal to prevent the vehi-
cle from rolling backwards.
The  hill  start  assistance  function 
should  not  be  used  for  prolonged 
stops: use the brake pedal.
This function is not designed to im-
mobilise the vehicle permanently.

Remember that driving a vehicle off-
road is very different to driving it on 
the road.
To  make  the  most  of  your  vehicle 
in an off-road situation, we recom-
mend that you are trained to drive a 
4x4 (4WD) vehicle.
The  safety  of  both  you  and  your 
passengers  is  your  responsibility, 
and depends on your skill and the 
care you take when driving off-road.

“4WD Lock" mode
To activate this mode, turn selector 1 to 
the “4WD Lock” position. The selector 
the returns to the “AUTO” position. The 
’ indicator light will light up on the 
instrument panel.
Operating principle
“4WD  Lock”  mode  distributes  the 
engine  torque  between  the  front  and 
rear axles in order to optimise the per-
formance capacity of the vehicle in off-
road situations. This mode should only 
be used in extreme driving conditions 
(mud, steep slopes, sand).
To deactivate this mode, turn selector 1  
to the “4WD Lock” position again. The 
warning  light  goes  out  on  the  instru-
ment panel.

Note:  If  the  vehicle  speed  exceeds 
approximately  24.8  mph  (40  km/h)  in 
“4WD  Lock”  mode,  the  system  auto-
matically  switches  back  to  “AUTO” 
mode.
The ’ warning light goes out and 
the  warning light comes on.
Special features of the 
4-wheel drive transmission
The vehicle may make more noise when 
the “AUTO" or "4WD Lock" modes are 
activated. This is normal. If the system 
detects a difference in the dimensions 
of  the  front  and  rear  wheels  (eg.  un-
derinflation, severe wear on an axle), 
the  system  automatically  switches  to 
"2WD" mode.
The message “4WD unavailable unsuit-
able tyres” is displayed on the instru-
ment panel. Drive as soon as possible 
at  a  moderate  speed  to  an  approved 
dealer.

This  problem  may  be  resolved  by 
changing  the  tyres.  Always  use  four 
identical  tyres  (same  brand,  profile, 
etc.) and with similar wear.
In the event of excessive wheelspin, the 
mechanical components may overheat.
If this happens:
–  at  first,  the  ’   warning  light 
comes on. “4WD Lock” mode is still 
active  –  however,  we  recommend 
that you stop as soon as possible to 
allow the system to cool down (until 
the warning light goes out);

–  if the wheels still spin, the system au-
tomatically switches to “2WD” mode 
to  protect  the  mechanical  compo-
nents.
The message “4WD overheating” is 
displayed  on  the  instrument  panel. 
The mode cannot be changed while 
the message is displayed.

TRANSMISSION: 4-wheel drive (4WD) (3/4)
After stopping the engine, the system 
may  take  up  to  five  minutes  to  cool

When “4WD Lock" mode is active, the 
ABS switches to off-road mode. In this 
case,  the  wheels  may  lock  intermit-
tently to achieve better grip, thus reduc-
ing braking distances on soft ground. 
When this mode is active:
–  the vehicle’s manoeuvrability is lim-
ited  during  braking.  This  operating 
mode is therefore not recommended 
in very low-grip conditions (eg. ice).

Electronic stability program and 
traction control when driving off-
road
When  driving  on  soft  ground  (sand, 
mud, deep snow), we recommend that 
you  deactivate  the  ESC  function  by 
pressing the “ESC” switch.
In this case, only individual wheel brak-
ing  remains  active.  This  function  ap-
plies the brake to any wheel that is slip-
ping, allowing the engine torque to be 
transferred to the wheels with the most 
grip.  This  is  particularly  useful  when 
crossing a bridge.
All  the  ESC  functions  will  be  reacti-
vated when the vehicle speed reaches 
approximately 31 mph (50 km/h) (24.8 
mph  [40  km/h]  in  4WD  Lock  mode), 
when the engine is restarted or when 
the “ESC” switch is pressed again.

–  there  may  be  some  noise.  This  is 
normal, and does not indicate an op-
erating fault.

Operating faults
If the system detects an operating fault, 
it  automatically  switches  to  “2WD” 
mode. The message “Check 4WD” is 
displayed on the instrument panel, and 
the ‘  and ©  warning  lights 
come on.
Drive as soon as possible at a moder-
ate speed to an approved dealer.
For certain operating faults, the system 
may not be able to switch to “2WD" or 
"4WD Lock" mode. "AUTO" mode re-
mains active.
Contact an approved dealer as soon as 
possible.

TRANSMISSION: 4-wheel drive (4WD) (4/4)

All-wheel drive system
– Irrespective of the mode selected, do not start the engine if one or more wheels are not in contact with the ground 
(eg. when the vehicle is on a jack or roller bench).
– Do not turn the mode selector when cornering, reversing or if the wheels are spinning excessively. Only select the 

“2WD”, “AUTO” or “4WD Lock” mode when the vehicle is being driven in a straight line.

–  Only use tyres which meet the required specifications.
–  “4WD Lock” mode is exclusively reserved for driving off-road. The use of this mode in any other conditions may adversely 

affect the vehicle’s manoeuvrability and damage its mechanical components.

–  Always ensure tyres with identical specifications are fitted to all four wheels (brand, size, structure, wear etc.). Fitting tyres 
of different sizes to the front and rear wheels and/or left and right wheels may have serious consequences for the tyres, 
gearbox, transfer gearbox and the rear differential pinions.

LANE DEPARTURE WARNING (1/3)
This  system  notifies  the  driver  when 
they accidentally cross a continuous or 
broken line.
This function uses a camera attached 
to the windscreen, behind the rear-view 
mirror.

This function is a driving aid in the event of the accidental crossing of 
a continuous or broken line in the road. However, the function is not in-
tended to replace the driver. The function can be disrupted under certain 
conditions, including:

–  poor visibility (rain, snow, fog, dirty windscreen, glare of the sun, partially ob-

scured road lines, etc.);
–  roads with tight bends;
–  closely following a vehicle in the same lane;
–  worn road markings, difficult to distinguish or spaced very widely apart;
–  narrow roads;
–  ...
In this case, the line visibility indicators remain uncoloured on the instrument 
panel to indicate that the function will not operate (lines not detected).
Under no circumstances should this function replace the driver’s care or respon-
sibility whilst performing manoeuvres.

A

This  system  alerts  the  driver  to  other 
vehicles in the detection zone A.
The system is activated when the vehi-
cle’s speed is between approximately 
30  km/h  (19  mph)  and  140  km/h 
(87 mph).
This function uses sensors 1 installed 
in  the  front  and  rear  bumper  of  both 
sides.

Special feature
Make sure that the sensors are not ob-
scured (by dirt, mud, snow, etc.).
If a sensor is obscured, the message 
“Blind spotclean sensor” will appear on 
the  instrument  panel.  Clean  the  sen-
sors.

This  function  is  an  addi-
tional  aid  which  indicates 
other  vehicles  in  the  blind 
spot area.

It can never in any case be a subs-
titute  for  care  nor  for  the  driver’s 
responsibility while in charge of his 
vehicle.
The  driver  should  always  look  out 
for sudden hazards during driving: 
make sure while manoeuvring that 
there are no moving or movable ob-
jects (such as a child, an animal, a 
pushchair or a bicycle) or small or

Indicator 4
An indicator light 4 is located on each 
door mirror 5.
Note:  Clean  the  door  mirrors  5  regu-
larly, so that the indicator lights 4 can 
be seen properly.

Operation
This function will indicate:
–  when the vehicle speed is between 
approximately 30 km/h (19 mph) and 
140 km/h (87 mph);

–  when another vehicle is in the blind 
spot area and travelling in the same 
direction as your vehicle.

If  another  vehicle  is  being  overtaken, 
the indicator 4 will be activated only if 
that vehicle remains in the blind spot for 
more than one second.

Display B
The function is activated and has not 
detected any vehicles.

Display C
Initial  warning:  the  indicator  light  4 
shows that a vehicle has been detected 
in the blind spot.

Display D
When the direction indicator is activa-
ted, the indicator light 4 flashes when a 
vehicle is detected in the blind spot on 
the side towards which you are about to 
steer. If you cancel the direction indica-
tor, the function will return to the initial 
warning (display C).

Note: The system’s detection range 
operates  according  to  a  standard 
lane  width.  If  you  are  driving  in 
narrow  traffic  lanes,  it  may  detect 
vehicles in other lanes.

– The  system’s  detection 
range  operates  according 
to a standard lane width. If 
you are driving in wide traf-
fic  lanes,  the  system  might  not 
be able to detect a vehicle in the 
blind spot.

–  The  system  might  be  disrupted 
momentarily  if  it  is  exposed  to 
strong  electromagnetic  waves 
(as  beneath  high-tension  power 
lines)  or  to  very  poor  weather 
conditions  (heavy  rain,  snow, 
etc.).  Remain  aware  of  driving 
conditions.

There is a risk of accidents.

Conditions for non-function
–  If the object is not moving;
–  if traffic is heavy;
–  the road is winding;
–  if front and rear sensors both detect 
objects at the same time (e.g. when 
passing an articulated lorry).

Switching on
Press switch 1 on side . The indica-
tor light  comes on, lit orange, and 
the  message  “Speed  limiter”  appears 
on the instrument panel, accompanied 
by  dashes  to  indicate  that  the  speed 
limiter function is activated and waiting 
to store a limited speed.
To store the current speed, press the 
switch 2 on side a (+): the limited speed 
will replace the dashes.
The minimum stored speed is 20 mph 
(30 km/h).

The  speed  limiter  function  helps  you 
stay within the driving speed limit that 
you choose, known as the limit speed.

If you wish, you can associate the 
speed  limiter  and  the  “Overspeed 
alert” function (please refer to the in-
formation on the “Overspeed alert” 
in Section 2).

CRUISE CONTROL-SPEED LIMITER: speed limiter function (2/3)

Varying the limit speed
The speed limiter can be changed by 
repeatedly pressing the switch 2:
–  side a (+) to increase the speed;
–  side b (-) to reduce the speed.

Exceeding the limit speed
It is possible to exceed the limit speed 
at any time. To do this: press the accel-
erator pedal firmly and fully (beyond 
the resistance point).
While the speed is being exceeded, the 
speed limiter flashes red on the instru-
ment panel.
Then,  release  the  accelerator:  the 
speed  limiter  function  will  return  as 
soon as you reach a speed lower than 
the stored speed.
Limited speed cannot be maintained
If driving up or down a steep gradient, 
the  system  is  unable  to  maintain  the 
limited  speed:  the  memorised  speed 
flashes red on the instrument panel and 
a  beep  sounds  at  regular  intervals  to 
inform you.

The speed limiter function is 
in no way linked to the brak-
ing system.

Driving
When a limited speed has been stored 
and this speed is not reached, driving is 
similar to driving a vehicle without the 
speed limiter function.
Once  you  have  reached  the  stored 
speed,  no  effort  on  the  accelera-
tor  pedal  will  allow  you  to  exceed 
the  programmed  speed  except  in  an 
emergency  (refer  to  information  on

When  the  speed  limiter  is  put  on 
standby,  pressing  side  a  (+)  on 
the  switch  2  reactivates  the  func-
tion  without  taking  into  account 
the stored speed: it is the speed at 
which the vehicle is moving that is 
taken into account.

OVERSPEED ALERT (1/3)

1

The overspeed alert with signage panel 
recognition notifies the driver that they 
are  exceeding  the  speed  limit  for  the 
section of road on which they are cur-
rently travelling.

Once the speed limiter is activated, you 
can adjust the speed limiter indication 
displayed by the system.
In  the  event  of  exceeding  the  speed 
limit, the sign display is modified (the 
characters change to red or the circle 
around the sign flashes) no notify you.
Special situation
The system does not take into account 
exceptional speed limit measures, such 
as peak pollution days.

Operating principle
The system detects speed limit signs 
on the side of the road and displays the 
speed limit.
This  mainly  uses  information  taken 
from  the  camera  1,  attached  to  the 
windscreen behind the rear-view mirror.
Note: Make sure the windscreen is not 
obstructed (dirt, ice, snow, etc.).
With the engine running, once you have 
activated the system, dashes on the in-
strument panel notify the driver that the 
system is running.
When  a  speed  limit  sign  is  detected, 
this speed will replace the dashes for 
a few seconds, after which the dashes 
will come on again until the next speed 
limit sign is detected.

2.55

OVERSPEED ALERT (3/3)
Operating fault
The  system  cannot  detect  the  speed 
limit if:
–  the windscreen is not clean;
–  the camera is blinded by the sun;
–  there  is  insufficient  visibility  (night, 

fog, etc.);

–  the signs are not legible (snow, etc.) 
or are hidden (by another vehicle or 
by trees).

This function is an additional driving aid. However, this function is not 
under any circumstances intended to replace the due care and attention 
of the driver, who should at all times be in control of the vehicle.
The driver should always adapt their speed to the traffic conditions, re-

gardless of the system indications.
The system enables maximum speed signs to be detected and does not detect 
other traffic signage.
The driver should not, however, ignore signs which are not detected by the system 
and should as a priority comply with the traffic signage and the highway code.
In the event of poor visibility (fog, snow, frost, etc.), it is possible that the system 
may not indicate the correct speed to the driver.
The driver should always adapt their speed to the traffic conditions, regardless of 
the system indications.

cruising speed saved) (O).

This  function  is  an  addi-
tional driving aid. However, 
the  function  does  not  take 
the  place  of  the  driver. 
Therefore, it can under no circum-
stances replace the driver’s respon-
sibility to respect speed limits and to 
be vigilant (the driver must always 
be  ready  to  brake).  Cruise  control 
must not be used in heavy traffic, on 
undulating or slippery roads (black 
ice, aquaplaning, gravel) and during 
bad weather (fog, rain, side winds 
etc.).
There is a risk of accidents.

PARKING DISTANCE CONTROL (1/5)
Operating principle
Ultrasonic sensors in the rear bumper 
measure the distance between the ve-
hicle and an obstacle.
This  measurement  is  indicated  by 
beeps which become more frequent the 
closer you come to the obstacle, until 
they become a continuous beep when 
the  vehicle  is  approximately  20  to 
30 centimetres from the obstacle.
The  system  detects  obstacles  to  the 
front, the rear and the sides of the ve-
hicle.
The  parking  distance  control  system 
is  only  activated  when  the  vehicle  is 
driven at a speed below approximately 
6 mph (10 km/h).
The  parking  distance  control  system 
does not take into account towing and 
load carrying systems etc.

Special features
Ensure that the ultrasonic sensors indi-
cated by arrows 1 are not obscured (by 
dirt, mud, snow, etc.).

This  function  is  an  addi-
tional aid that indicates the 
distance between the vehi-
cle  and  an  obstacle  whilst 

reversing, using sound signals.
Under  no  circumstances  should  it 
replace the driver’s care or respon-
sibility whilst reversing.
The driver should always be ready 
for  sudden  incidents  while  driv-
ing:  always  ensure  that  there  are 
no small, narrow moving obstacles 
(such as a child, animal, pushchair, 
bicycle, stone, post, etc.) in the blind 
spot when manoeuvring.

If a side obstacle is detected:
–  the beeps become faster and then 
sound continuously as the obstacle 
gets nearer. Green, orange and red 
zones will be displayed on the dis-
play D;

–  if there is no risk of collision, no beep 
will sound when approaching the ob-
stacle. Green, orange and red zones 
will be displayed interspersed on the

Detection of obstacles to the side
Depending  on  the  direction  of  the 
wheels, the system determines the tra-
jectory of the vehicle and notifies the 
driver of any risk or otherwise of a col-
lision with an obstacle 3 to the side of 
the vehicle.

An  impact  to  the  under-
side  of  the  vehicle  while 
manoeuvring  (e.g.  strik-
ing  a  post,  raised  kerb  or 
other street furniture) may result in 
damage to the vehicle (e.g. defor-
mation of an axle).
To avoid any risk of accident, have 
your  vehicle  checked  by  an  ap-
proved Dealer.

Operation
Moving into reverse gear, the camera 1 
located on the tailgate provides a view 
of the area behind the vehicle on the 
multimedia screen 2, accompanied by 
one or two moving or fixed guide lines 4 
and 3.
This system is initially used with the aid 
of several gauges (mobile for trajectory 
and fixed for distance). When the red 
zone is reached, use the bumper image 
to stop accurately.

tres from the vehicle;

–  B  (yellow)  approximately  70  centi-

metres from the vehicle;

–  C (green) approximately 150 centi-

metres from the vehicle.

This gauge remains fixed and indicates 
the vehicle trajectory if the wheels are 
in line with the vehicle.

4 moving guide line:
This is shown in blue on the multifunc-
tion  screen 2.  It  indicates  the  vehicle 
trajectory according to the position of 
the steering wheel.

The screen shows a reverse mirror 
image.
The  frames  are  a  representation 
projected onto flat ground; this in-
formation  must  not  be  taken  into 
account  when  superimposed  on  a 
vertical  object  or  an  object  on  the 
ground.
Objects which appear on the edge 
of the screen may be deformed.
In very bright light (snow, vehicle in 
sunshine  etc.),  the  camera  vision 
may be adversely affected.
If the boot is open or poorly closed, 
the message “Boot open” appears 
and the camera display disappears.

This function is an additional 
aid.  It  cannot,  therefore, 
under  any  circumstances 
replace the vigilance or the 

responsibility of the driver.
The driver should always be ready 
for  sudden  incidents  while  driv-
ing:  always  ensure  that  there  are 
no small, narrow moving obstacles 
(such as a child, animal, pushchair, 
bicycle, stone, post, etc.) in the blind 
spot when manoeuvring.

–  parallel parking;
–  perpendicular parking;
–  angle parking;
–  moving  out  of  a  parallel  parking 

space.

From  the  multifunction  screen,  select 
the manoeuvre to be performed.
Note:  When  starting  the  vehicle,  or 
after  successfully  completed  parallel 
parking  using  the  system,  the  default 
manoeuvre proposed by the system is 
assistance in exiting a parallel parking 
space. In other cases, the default ma-
noeuvre can be set from the multifunc-
tion screen.

Operation
Parking
As  long  as  the  vehicle  speed  is  less 
than  20  mph  (30  km/h),  the  system 
looks for available parking spaces on 
both sides of the vehicle.
Once a space has been found, it is dis-
played on the multifunction screen, indi-
cated by a small letter “P”. Drive slowly, 
with the indicators activated on the side 
of the space, until the message “Stop” 
is displayed, alongside a beep. 
The space is then indicated on the mul-
tifunction screen by a capital “P”.

ASSISTED PARKING (4/4)

This function is an additional driving aid. However, this function is not under any circumstances intended to replace the 
due care and attention of the driver, who should at all times be in control of the vehicle.
Make sure that the manoeuvre complies with the applicable traffic regulations at your location.

–  The driver should always look out for sudden hazards during driving: always ensure that there are no moving obstacles 
(such as a child, animal, pram, bicycle, etc.) or small, narrow objects such as stones or posts in your path when manoeu-
vring.

–  The system cannot detect objects located in the sensor blind spots.
–  When manoeuvring, the steering wheel may turn quickly: do not put your hands inside, and make sure that nothing is caught 

inside.

–  Always visually check that the parking space proposed by the system is still available and contains no obstacles.
–  The system should be deactivated when towing a trailer.

mode.

Operation
With the selection lever 1 in position P, 
switch on the ignition.
To move out of position P, you must de-
press the brake pedal before pressing 
the unlocking button 2.
With  your  foot  on  the  brake  pedal 
(warning light Ó on the display 3 
goes out), move the lever out of posi-
tion P.
Only engage D or R when the vehi-
cle is stopped, with your foot on the 
brake and the accelerator pedal re-
leased.

2.72

Driving in automatic mode
Move lever 1 to position D.
In  most  road  conditions  you  will  en-
counter, you will not need to touch your 
lever again: the gears will change au-
tomatically at the right time and at the 
most  suitable  engine  speed  because 
the  automatic  system  takes  into  ac-
count the vehicle load and road contour 
and adjusts itself to the particular driv-
ing style you have chosen.
Economical driving
When  driving,  always  leave  the  lever 
in position D, keeping the accelerator 
pedal lightly depressed to ensure auto-
matic gear changes at a lower engine 
speed.
Accelerating and overtaking
Depress  the  accelerator  pedal  firmly 
and  fully  (so  that  it  goes  beyond  the 
kickdown point).
This will enable you to change down 
to  the  optimum  gear  within  the 
engine range.

AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (2/3)

Special cases
In certain driving conditions (for exam-
ple, engine protection, operation of the 
Electronic Stability Programme: the au-
tomatic system may change gear auto-
matically.
Likewise, to prevent incorrect manoeu-
vres, a gear change may be refused by 
the automatic system: in this case the 
gear display flashes for a few seconds 
as a warning.

1

Special circumstances
–  If the bends and road surface do 
not  allow  you  to  stay  in  automatic 
mode  (e.g.  in  the  mountains),  we 
recommend  that  you  change  to 
manual mode. This will prevent the 
automatic  gearbox  from  changing 
gear repeatedly when climbing, and 
permit  engine  braking  on  long  de-
scents.

–  In  cold  weather,  start  the  engine 
and  wait  a  few  seconds  before 
moving the selector lever from posi-
tion P or N and engaging it in D or R 
to prevent the engine stalling.

Driving in manual mode
With the selection lever 1 in position D, 
move the lever to the left.
Shifting the lever repeatedly allows you 
to change gears manually:
–  to  move  down  through  the  gears, 

push the lever forwards;

–  to move up through the gears, push 

the lever backwards.

The gear selected is displayed on the 
instrument panel.

When  facing  uphill,  to  remain 
stopped, do not keep your foot on 
the accelerator.
Risk  of  overheating  the  automatic 
gearbox.

2.73

AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (3/3)
Parking the vehicle
When the vehicle is stopped, move the 
lever to position P while keeping your 
foot on the brake pedal: the gearbox is 
in neutral and the drive wheels are me-
chanically locked by the driveshaft.
Apply the handbrake or, depending 
on the vehicle, ensure that the elec-
tronic parking brake is applied.

Maintenance period
Refer  to  the  maintenance  document 
for your vehicle or consult an Approved 
Dealer to check whether the automatic 
gearbox  requires  scheduled  mainte-
nance.
If it does not need to be serviced, there 
is no need to top up the oil.

4

Operating faults
–  when  driving,  if  the  message 
“Check  auto  gearbox”  appears  on 
the instrument panel, it indicates a 
failure.
Contact  your  approved  Dealer  as 
soon as possible;

–  when  driving,  if  the  message 
“Gearbox  overheating”  appears  on 
the instrument panel, stop as soon 
as possible to let the gearbox cool 
down  and  wait  for  the  message  to 
disappear;

–  If  a  vehicle  with  an  automatic 
gearbox breaks down, refer to the 
information on “Towing” in Section 5.

When setting off, if the lever is locked 
in  position  P  even  though  you  are 
pressing the brake pedal, the lever can 
be released manually. To do this, insert 
a tool (with a hard rod) into the slot 4 to 
unlock the lever.
Contact an authorised dealer as soon 
as possible.

For safety reasons, do not 
switch off the ignition before 
the  vehicle  has  come  to  a 
complete standstill.

An  impact  to  the  under-
side  of  the  vehicle  while 
manoeuvring  (e.g.:  strik-
ing  a  post,  raised  kerb  or 
other street furniture) may result in 
damage to the vehicle (e.g.: defor-
mation of an axle).
To avoid any risk of accident, have 
your  vehicle  checked  by  an  ap-
proved Dealer.

Switching the air 
recirculation on
Press the button 2: the warning light B 
comes  on.  In  these  conditions,  air  is 
taken from the passenger compartment 
and is recycled, with no air being taken 
from outside the vehicle.

Air recirculation is for:
–  isolating the vehicle from the exter-
nal atmosphere (driving in polluted 
areas, etc.);

–  lowering  the  passenger  compart-
ment temperature as quickly as pos-
sible.

Prolonged use of air recirculation can lead to condensation forming on the side 
windows and windscreen, and discomfort due to the use of non-renewed air in 
the passenger compartment. We therefore advise you to return to normal mode 
(external air) as soon as the air recirculation function is no longer required, by 
pressing the button 6 again.

speed: it gradually increases). This 
may take several minutes.
Generally speaking, unless there is 
a particular reason not to, the dash-
board air vents should remain open.

it manually.
Note:
–  during recirculation, air is taken from 
the  passenger  compartment  and 
is recycled, with no air being taken 
from outside the vehicle;

–  air recirculation allows the external 
atmosphere to be cut off (when driv-
ing in polluted areas, etc.);

–  lowering  the  passenger  compart-
ment temperature as quickly as pos-
sible.

The demisting/de-icing will still take 
priority over the air recirculation.

Manual use
Pressing the button 9 allows air recir-
culation to be forced. In this case, the 
integrated warning light comes on and 
the indicator D goes out.
Prolonged use of this position may lead 
to  odours,  caused  by  non-renewal  of 
air, and the formation of condensation 
on the windows.
We therefore advise you to return to au-
tomatic mode as soon as air recircula-
tion is no longer needed, by pressing 
button 9.

Stopping the system
To stop the system, press the button 1 
OFF  (the  integrated  warning  light 
comes  on)  or,  depending  on  the  ve-
hicle,  reduce  the  fan  speed  down  to 
a  minimum  by  pressing  the  button  6 
marked  by  OFF  as  many  times  as  is 
necessary.
To start, press the switch 7.

AIR CONDITIONING: information and operating instructions (1/2)
Advice on use
In some situations (air conditioning off, 
air  recirculation  activated,  ventilation 
speed  at  zero  or  low  etc.),  you  may 
notice that condensation starts to form 
on the windows and windscreen.
If there is condensation, use the “Clear 
View” function to remove it, then use 
the air conditioning in automatic mode 
to stop it forming again.

Fuel consumption
You will normally notice an increase in 
fuel  consumption  (especially  in  town) 
when the air conditioning is operating.
For vehicles fitted with air conditioning 
with no automatic mode, switch off the 
system when it is not required.
Advice  for  reducing  consumption 
and helping to preserve the environ-
ment
Drive with the air vents open and the 
windows closed.
If  the  vehicle  has  been  parked  in  the 
sun, open the doors for a few moments 
to let the hot air escape before starting 
the engine.

Vehicles  equipped  with  ECO 
mode:  once  activated,  ECO  mode 
may reduce the performance of the 
air conditioning. Please refer to the 
information on “Driving advice, Eco-
driving” in Section 2.

Maintenance
Refer  to  the  Maintenance  Document 
for your vehicle for the inspection fre-
quency.

Do not add anything to the 
vehicle’s  ventilation  circuit 
(for  example,  to  remove 
bad odours).

There  is  a  risk  of  damage  or  of 
fire.

Use the air conditioning system reg-
ularly, even in cold weather, running 
it at least once a month for approxi-
mately 5 minutes.

Operating faults
As  a  general  rule,  contact  your  ap-
proved dealer in the event of an oper-
ating fault.
–  Reduction in de-icing, demisting 

or air conditioning performance.
This may be caused by the passen-
ger compartment filter cartridge be-
coming clogged.

–  No cold air is being produced.

Check that the controls are set cor-
rectly and that the fuses are sound. 
Otherwise, switch off the system.

Presence of water under the 
vehicle
After  prolonged  use  of  the  air  condi-
tioning  system,  it  is  normal  for  water 
to be present under the vehicle. This is 
caused by condensation.

Do not open the refriger-
ant fluid circuit. The fluid 
may damage eyes or skin.

Closing the bonnet
Before closing the bonnet, make sure 
that nothing has been left in the engine 
compartment.
To close the bonnet, replace the stay 4 
in its holder 5. Hold the middle of the 
bonnet and guide it down to one foot 
(30 cm) above the closed position, then 
release. It will latch automatically under 
its own weight.

After carrying out any work 
in  the  engine  compart-
ment,  check  that  nothing 
has been left behind (cloth, 

tools, etc.).
These may damage the engine or 
cause a fire.

Ensure  that  the  bonnet  is 
properly locked.
Check  that  nothing  is  pre-
venting the catch from lock-

ing (gravel, cloth, etc.).

In the event of even a slight 
impact involving the radia-
tor  grille  or  bonnet,  have 
the bonnet lock checked by 
an approved dealer as soon as pos-
sible.

ENGINE OIL LEVEL: general information
It is normal for an engine to use oil for 
B
lubrication and cooling of moving parts 
and it is normal to top up the level be-
tween oil changes.
However,  contact  your  approved 
Dealer if more than 0.5 litres is being 
consumed every 600 miles (1,000 km) 
after the running in period.
Oil change frequency: check the oil 
level from time to time and certainly 
before any long journey to avoid the 
risk of damaging your engine.

–  Remove the dipstick and wipe with a 

clean, lint-free cloth;

–  push the dipstick in as far as it will 
go (for vehicles equipped with a cap-
type dipstick C, screw the cap in as 
far as it will go);

–  take out the dipstick again;
–  read  the  level:  it  should  never  fall 
below  minimum  mark A  or  exceed 
maximum mark B.

Once  the  operation  has  been  com-
pleted,  ensure  that  the  dipstick  is 
pushed  in  as  far  as  it  will  go  or  that 
the  “cap-type  dipstick”  is  completely 
screwed in.

Reading the oil level
The oil level should be read with the ve-
hicle on level ground, after the engine 
has been switched off for some time.
The  dipstick  must  be  used  to  read 
the  exact  oil  level  and  make  sure 
that the maximum level has not been 
exceeded  (risk  of  engine  damage). 
Refer to the following pages.
The  instrument  panel  display  only 
alerts the driver when the oil level is at 
its minimum.

to  the  engine  and  catalytic  con-
verter.
If  the  level  exceeds  the  maximum 
level, do not start your vehicle and 
contact an authorised dealer.

In order to prevent splashback, it is 
recommended that a funnel be used 
when topping up/filling with oil.

Before  performing  any 
action  in  the  engine  com-
partment, the ignition must 
be switched off (please see

Topping up/filling
The  vehicle  must  be  parked  on  level 
ground  and  the  engine  should  be 
stopped and cold (for instance, before 
the engine is started up for the first time 
in the day).

Before  performing  any 
action  in  the  engine  com-
partment, the ignition must 
be switched off (please see 
the  information  on  “Starting,  stop-
ping the engine” in Section 2).

–  Unscrew cap 1;
–  top up the level (as a guide, the ca-
pacity  between  the  minimum  and 
maximum reading on the dipstick 2 
is between 1.5 and 2 litres, depend-
ing on the engine);

–  wait for approximately 10 minutes to 

allow the oil to flow into the engine;

–  check the level using the dipstick 2 

(as described above).

Once  the  operation  has  been  com-
pleted,  ensure  that  the  dipstick  is 
pushed  in  as  far  as  it  will  go  or  that 
the  “cap-type  dipstick”  is  completely 
screwed in.

In order to prevent splashback, it is 
recommended that a funnel be used 
when topping up/filling with oil.

BODYWORK MAINTENANCE (1/3)
A  well-maintained  vehicle  will  last 
longer. It is therefore recommended to 
maintain the exterior of the vehicle reg-
ularly.
Your vehicle has been treated with very 
effective  anti-corrosion  products.  It  is 
nevertheless subject to various outside 
influences.
Corrosive agents in the atmosphere
–   atmospheric  pollution  (built-up  and 

industrial areas);

–   saline  atmospheres  (near  the  sea, 

particularly in hot weather);

–   seasonal and damp weather condi-
tions (e.g. road salt in winter, water 
from road cleaners, etc.).

Minor impacts
Abrasive action
Dust and sand in the air, mud, road grit 
thrown up by other vehicles, etc.
You should take a number of minor pre-
cautions in order to safeguard your ve-
hicle against such risks.

grime;

You should
Wash  your  car  frequently,  with  the 
engine off, with cleaning products rec-
ommended by the manufacturer (never 
use  abrasive  products).  Rinse  thor-
oughly beforehand with a jet:
–   spots  of  tree  resin  and  industrial 

–   mud in the wheel arches and under-
neath  the  body  which  forms  damp 
patches;

–   bird  droppings,  which  cause  a 
chemical reaction with the paint that 
rapidly discolours paintwork and 
may even cause the paint to peel 
off;
 wash  the  vehicle  immediately  to 
remove these marks since it is im-
possible to remove them by polish-
ing;

–   salt, particularly in the wheel arches 
and underneath the body after driv-
ing in areas where the roads have 
been gritted.

 

Remove any plant matter (resin, leaves, 
etc.) from the vehicle regularly.

Respect local regulations about wash-
ing vehicles (e.g. do not wash your ve-
hicle on a public highway).
Observe the vehicle stopping distances 
when driving on gravelled surfaces to 
prevent paint damage.
Repair, or have repaired quickly, areas 
where the paint has been damaged, to 
prevent corrosion spreading.
Remember to visit the body shop pe-
riodically  in  order  to  maintain  your 
anti-corrosion  warranty.  Refer  to  the 
Maintenance Document.
If  it  is  necessary  to  clean  mechani-
cal  components,  hinges,  etc.,  spray 
them  with  products  approved  by  our 
Technical Department to protect them 
after they have been cleaned.

We have selected special products 
to care for your vehicle and you can 
obtain these from the manufactur-
er’s accessory outlets.

BODYWORK MAINTENANCE (2/3)
What you should not do
Wash the vehicle in bright sunlight or 
freezing temperatures.
Do not scrape off mud or dirt without 
pre-wetting.
Allow dirt to accumulate on the exterior.
Allow rust to form following minor im-
pacts.
Do not use solvents not approved by 
our  Technical  Department  to  remove 
stains as this could damage the paint-
work.
Do not drive in snow or muddy condi-
tions without washing the vehicle, par-
ticularly  under  the  wheel  arches  and 
body.

Degrease or clean using 
high-pressure  cleaning 
equipment  or  by  spray-
ing  on  products  not  ap-
proved by our Technical 
Department:

–   mechanical  components 

(e.g.: 

engine compartment);

–   underbody;
–   parts  with  hinges  (e.g.:  inside  the 

–   painted plastic external fittings (e.g.: 

doors);

bumpers).

Doing this could give rise to corrosion 
or operational faults.

4.16

BODYWORK MAINTENANCE (3/3)
Vehicles with a matte paint 
finish
This type of paint requires certain pre-
cautions.
You should do the following
Wash the vehicle by hand using plenty 
of water, using a soft cloth or a gentle 
sponge.
Do not do the following
Use wax-based products (polishing).
Rub too hard.
Wash  the  vehicle  in  a  roller-type  car 
wash.
Attach stickers to the paintwork (risk of 
leaving marks).

Using a roller type car wash
Return  the  windscreen  wiper  stalk  to 
the Park position (refer to the informa-
tion on the “Windscreen washer, wiper” 
in  Section  1).  Check  the  mounting  of 
external accessories, additional lights 
and mirrors, and ensure that the wiper 
blades are secured with adhesive tape.
Remove  the  radio  aerial  mast  if  your 
vehicle is fitted with this equipment. 
Remember to remove the tape and refit 
the antenna after washing.

Wash 
the  vehicle 
using a high-pressure 
cleaning device.

Cleaning the headlights
As the headlights are made of plastic 
“glass”, use a soft cloth or cotton wool 
to  clean  them.  If  this  does  not  clean 
them  properly,  moisten  the  cloth  with 
soapy water, then wipe clean with a soft 
damp cloth or cotton wool.
Finally, carefully dry off with a soft dry 
cloth.
Do not use cleaning products con-
taining  alcohol  or  utensils  (e.g.:  a 
scraper).

4.17

INTERIOR TRIM MAINTENANCE (1/2)
A  well-maintained  vehicle  will  last 
longer. It is therefore recommended to 
maintain the interior of the vehicle regu-
larly.
A  stain  should  always  be  dealt  with 
swiftly.
Whatever type of stain is on the trim, 
use cold (or warm) soapy water with 
natural soap.
Detergents (washing-up liquid, pow-
dered products, alcohol-based prod-
ucts) should not be used.
Use a soft cloth.
Rinse and soak up the excess.

Glass instrument panel
(e.g.  instrument  panel,  clock,  exterior 
temperature display, radio display, etc.)
Use a soft cloth (or cotton wool).
If  this  does  not  clean  them  properly, 
use a soft cloth (or cotton wool) slightly 
moistened with soapy water and then 
wipe clean with another soft damp cloth 
or cotton wool.
Finally, carefully dry off with a soft dry 
cloth.
Do not use products containing alco-
hol and/or spray fluids on the area.

Seat belts
These must be kept clean.
Use products selected by our Technical 
Department  (Approved  outlets)  or 
warm, soapy water and a sponge and 
wipe with a dry cloth.
Detergents or dyes must not be used 
under any circumstances.

4.18

Textiles (seats, door trim, etc)
Vacuum-clean the textiles regularly.
Liquid stain
Use soapy water.
Dab lightly (never rub) with a soft cloth, 
rinse and remove the excess.
Solid or pasty stain
Carefully  remove  the  excess  solid  or 
pasty  material  immediately  with  a 
spatula (working from the edges to the 
centre to avoid spreading the stain).
Clean as for a liquid stain.
Special instructions for sweets or 
chewing gum
Put an ice cube on the stain to solidify 
it, then proceed as for a solid stain.

For  further  recommendations  for 
maintaining  the  interior,  and/or  for 
any  unsatisfactory  results,  please 
see an authorised dealer.

INTERIOR TRIM MAINTENANCE (2/2)
Removal/replacing removable 
equipment originally fitted in 
the vehicle
If  you  need  to  remove  equipment  in 
order  to  clean  the  passenger  com-
partment (for example, mats), always 
ensure  that  they  are  correctly  refitted 
and are the right way around (the driv-
er’s mat should be fitted on the driver’s 
side, etc.) and fit them with the compo-
nents supplied with the equipment (for 
example, the driver mat should always 
be fixed using the pre-fitted mounting 
components).
With  the  vehicle  stationary,  always 
ensure that nothing will impede driving 
(anything obstructing the pedals, heel 
wedged by the mat etc.).

You should not:
Position  objects  such  as  deodorants, 
scents etc. near air vents as this could 
damage your dashboard trim.

Use  high-pressure 
cleaning  equipment  or 
sprays  inside  the  pas-
senger compartment: 

without  careful  use,  this  equipment 
could  impair  the  correct  functioning 
of the electrical or electronic compo-
nents  in  the  vehicle,  or  have  other 
detrimental effects.

PUNCTURE, EMERGENCY SPARE WHEEL (1/2)
In case of puncture
Depending on the vehicle, a tyre infla-
tion  kit  or  emergency  spare  wheel  is 
provided (refer to the following pages).
Special note
The  Tyre  Pressure  Monitor  function 
does not check the emergency spare 
wheel (the wheel replaced by the emer-
gency spare wheel disappears from the 
instrument panel display).
Refer  to  the  information  on  the  “Tyre 
pressure  monitoring  system” 
in 
Section 2.

If the emergency spare wheel has been stored for several years, have it 
checked by your Dealer to ensure that it is safe to use.
Vehicles fitted with an emergency spare wheel smaller than the 

four other wheels:
–  Never fit more than one emergency spare wheel to the same vehicle.
–  As the punctured wheel is wider than the emergency spare wheel, the vehicle’s 

–  Replace the emergency spare wheel as soon as possible with a wheel with the 

ground clearance is reduced.

same dimensions as the original.

–  When this is fitted to the vehicle, which must only be a temporary measure, the 
driving speed must not exceed the speed indicated on the label on the wheel.
–  Fitting an emergency spare wheel may alter the way the vehicle usually runs. 
Avoid sudden acceleration or deceleration and reduce your speed when cor-
nering.

–  If you need to use snow chains, fit the emergency spare wheel to the rear axle 

and check the tyre pressure.

5.2

PUNCTURE, EMERGENCY SPARE WHEEL (2/2)

A

Emergency spare wheel A
To get to it:
–  open the tailgate;
–  Depending on the vehicle, lift up the 

mobile floor;

–  lift the boot carpet;
–  remove the tool kit by lifting it by its 

handles;

–  unscrew the central mounting;
–  remove the emergency spare wheel.
Note: Store the punctured wheel in the 
storage  bag  provided,  along  with  the 
tool kit and put them in the boot.

If the vehicle is parked on 
the hard shoulder, you must 
warn  other  road  users  of 
your  vehicle’s  presence 
with a warning triangle or with other 
devices as per the legislation apply-
ing to the country you are in.

5.3

Do  not  attempt  to  use  the 
inflation  kit  if  the  tyre  has 
been damaged as a result 
of driving with a puncture.

You should therefore carefully check 
the  condition  of  the  tyre  sidewalls 
before any operation.
Driving  with  underinflated,  flat  or 
punctured tyres can be dangerous 
and may make the tyre impossible 
to repair.
This repair is temporary.
A  tyre  which  has  been  punctured 
should always be inspected (and re-
paired, where possible) as soon as 
possible by a specialist.
When taking a tyre which has been 
repaired using this kit to be replaced, 
you must inform the specialist.
When driving, vibration may be felt 
due  to  the  presence  of  the  repair 
product injected into the tyre.

The kit is only approved for 
inflating the tyres of the ve-
hicle  originally  equipped 
with the kit.

It  must  never  be  used  to  inflate 
the tyres of another vehicle, or any 
other inflatable object (rubber ring, 
rubber boat, etc.).
Avoid  spillage  on  skin  when  han-
dling  the  repair  product  bottle.  If 
droplets do leak out, rinse them off 
with plenty of water.
Keep the repair kit away from chil-
dren.
Do not dispose of the empty bottle 
in the countryside. Return it to your 
approved dealer or to a recycling or-
ganisation.
The  bottle  has  a  limited  service 
life which is indicated on its label. 
Check the expiry date.
Contact an approved dealer to re-
place  the  inflation  tube  and  repair 
product bottle.

TYRE PRESSURE KIT (1/3)

B

A

The  kit  repairs  tyres  when 
tread A  has  been  dam-
aged  by  objects  smaller 
than 4 mm. It cannot repair 
all types of puncture, such as cuts 
larger  than  4  mm,  or  cuts  in  tyre 
sidewall B.
Ensure also that the wheel rim is in 
good condition.
Do  not  pull  out  the  foreign  body 
causing the puncture if it is still in 
the tyre.

5.4

With  the  engine  running  and  the 
parking brake applied,
–  Unscrew the cap from recess 3 on 

the bottle;

–  unscrew the bottle cap 2;
–  screw the bottle 2 onto the compres-

sor at the bottle recess point 3; 

–  unscrew the valve cap on the rele-
vant  wheel  and  screw  the  inflation 
adapter 6 onto the valve;

–  disconnect  any  accessories  previ-
ously connected to the vehicle’s ac-
cessories sockets;

–  the plug 4 must be connected to the 

vehicle accessories socket;

–  press switch 5 to inflate the tyre to 
the recommended pressure (please 
refer to the information in the section 
on “Tyre pressure”);

In the event of a puncture, use the kit 
located  in  the  boot,  underneath  the 
boot carpet.

Before  using  this  kit,  park 
the  vehicle  at  a  sufficient 
distance from traffic, switch 
on  the  hazard  warning 
lights, apply the handbrake, ask all 
passengers to leave the vehicle and 
keep them away from traffic.

–  after a maximum of 10 minutes, stop 
inflating and read the pressure (on 
pressure gauge 1).
Note: while the container is empty-
ing (approximately 30 seconds), the 
pressure gauge 5 will briefly indicate 
a pressure of up to 6 bar. The pres-
sure will then drop.

–  adjust  the  pressure:  to  increase  it, 

continue inflating with the kit.

If  the  recommended  pressure  of 
1.8  bar  cannot  be  achieved  after 
10 minutes, repair is impossible. Do 
not drive the vehicle. Consult an au-
thorised dealer.

If the vehicle is parked on 
the hard shoulder, you must 
warn  other  road  users  of 
your  vehicle’s  presence 
with a warning triangle or with other 
devices as per the legislation apply-
ing to the country you are in.

5.5

TYRE PRESSURE KIT (3/3)

Once  the  tyre  is  correctly  inflated, 
remove the kit: slowly unscrew the in-
flation adapter 6 to prevent any repair 
product  from  escaping  and  store  the 
container  in  plastic  packaging  to  pre-
vent the product from escaping.

Nothing  should  be  placed 
around  the  driver’s  feet 
as  such  objects  may  slide 
under  the  pedals  during 
sudden  braking  manoeuvres  and 
obstruct their use.

5.6

–  Affix  the  driving  recommendation 
label to the dashboard where it can 
easily be seen by the driver;

–  Put the kit away.
–  At the end of this initial inflation op-
eration, air will still escape from the 
tyre. You must drive a short distance 
in order to seal the hole.

–  Start  immediately  and  drive  at  be-
tween  12  and  40  mph  (20  and 
60  km/h)  in  order  to  distribute  the 
product evenly in the tyre and, after 
driving for 2 miles (3 km), stop and 
check the pressure.

–  If the pressure is greater than 1.3 bar 
but  less  than  the  recommended 
pressure (refer to the label affixed to 
the edge of the driver’s door), read-
just it. Otherwise, please contact an 
authorised dealer: the tyre cannot be 
repaired.

Precautions when using the 
kit
The kit should not be operated for more 
than 10 consecutive minutes.

Please  be  aware  that  a 
poorly  tightened  or  miss-
ing valve cap can make the 
tyres less airtight and may 

lead to pressure loss.
Always use valve caps identical to 
those  fitted  originally  and  tighten 
them fully.

Following repair with the kit, 
do  not  travel  further  than 
120 miles (200 km). In addi-
tion, reduce your speed and 
under  no  circumstances  exceed 
48  mph  (80  km/h).  The  sticker, 
which you must affix in a prominent 
position on the dashboard, reminds 
you of this.
Depending on the country or local 
legislation, a tyre repaired with the 
inflation kit may need to be replaced.

Continue to crank the jack so that the 
baseplate  is  correctly  positioned  (it 
should be underneath the vehicle and 
aligned with the jack head).

Switch on the hazard warn-
ing lights.
Keep the vehicle away from 
traffic and on a level surface 

where it will not slip.
Apply the parking brake and engage 
a gear (first or reverse, or P for auto-
matic transmissions).
Ask all the passengers to leave the 
vehicle  and  keep  them  away  from 
traffic.

Vehicles equipped with a jack 
and wheelbrace
If necessary, remove the wheel trim.
Use the wheelbrace 1 to slacken off the 
wheel bolts. Position it so as to be able 
to push from above.
Crank  up  the  jack 3  by  hand  to  align 
the  jack  head  between  the  2  jacking 
points 2 closest to the relevant wheel.

If the vehicle is not equipped with a 
jack or wheelbrace, you can obtain 
these from your approved dealer.

If the vehicle is parked on 
the hard shoulder, you must 
warn  other  road  users  of 
your  vehicle’s  presence 
with a warning triangle or with other 
devices as per the legislation apply-
ing to the country you are in.

5.9

CHANGING A WHEEL (2/2)
Turn it a few times to lift the wheel off 
the ground.
Undo the bolts and take off the wheel.
Fit the emergency spare wheel on the 
central  hub  and  turn  it  to  locate  the 
mounting  holes  in  the  wheel  and  the 
hub.
Tighten  the  bolts,  checking  that  the 
wheel is correctly positioned on its hub. 
Lower the jack.
With the wheel on the ground, tighten 
the bolts fully and have the tightness of 
the bolts checked and the emergency 
spare wheel pressure checked as soon 
as possible.

If you have a puncture, re-
place the wheel as soon as 
possible.
A tyre which has been punc-
tured  should  always  be  inspected 
(and repaired, where possible) by a 
specialist.

5.10

Do not leave the tools un-
secured  inside  the  vehicle 
as  they  may  come  loose 
under  braking.  After  use, 
check that all the tools are correctly 
clipped into the tool kit, then posi-
tion it correctly in its housing: risk of 
injury.
If  wheel  bolts  are  supplied  in  the 
tool kit, only use these bolts for the 
emergency spare wheel: refer to the 
label affixed to the emergency spare 
wheel.
The  jack  is  designed  for  wheel 
changing purposes only. Under no 
circumstances should it be used for 
carrying out repairs underneath the 
vehicle or to gain access to the un-
derside of the vehicle.

TYRES (1/3)
The tyres are the only contact between 
the vehicle and the road, so it is essen-
tial to keep them in good condition.
You  must  make  sure  that  your  tyres 
conform to local road traffic regulations.

2

1

When the tread has worn down to the 
wear warning strips, these strips will 
become visible 2: it is then necessary 
to replace your tyres because the tread 
rubber  is  now  only  1.6  mm  deep  at 
most, resulting in poor road holding 
on wet roads.
An  overloaded  vehicle,  long  journeys 
by  motorway,  particularly  in  very  hot 
weather, or continual driving on poorly 
surfaced minor roads will lead to more 
rapid tyre wear and affect safety.

Maintaining the tyres
The  tyres  must  be  in  good  condition 
and the tread form must have sufficient 
depth; tyres approved by our Technical 
Department  have  tread  wear  indica-
tors 1 which are indicators moulded 
into the tread at several points.

Incidents which occur when 
driving, such as striking the 
kerb, may damage the tyres 
and wheel rims, and could 
also  lead  to  misalignment  of  the 
front or rear axle geometry. In this 
case,  have  the  condition  of  these 
checked by an approved dealer.

5.11

TYRES (2/3)
Tyre pressures
Adhere to the tyre pressures (including 
the emergency spare wheel). The tyre 
pressures should be checked at least 
once a month and additionally before 
any long journey (refer to the label af-
fixed to the edge of the driver’s door).

Incorrect  tyre  pressures 
lead to abnormal tyre wear 
and unusually hot running. 
These  are  factors  which 
may seriously affect safety and lead 
to:
–  poor road holding,
–  risk of bursting or tread separa-

tion.

The pressure depends on the load 
and  the  speed  of  use.  Adjust  the 
pressure  according  to  the  condi-
tions of use (refer to the label affixed 
to the edge of the driver’s door).

5.12

The pressures should be checked cold: 
ignore higher pressures which may be 
reached in hot weather or following a 
high speed journey.
If the tyre pressures cannot be checked 
when the tyres are cold, increase the 
pressures from 0.2 to 0.3 bar (or 3 PSI).
Never deflate a hot tyre.
Special note
Depending  on  the  vehicle,  there  may 
be an adapter which needs to be posi-
tioned on the valve before air is added.

Vehicle  fitted  with  a  tyre  pressure 
monitoring system 
In  cases  of  under-inflation  (puncture, 
low pressure, etc.), warning light  
lights  up  on  the  instrument  panel. 
Please refer to the information on the 
“Tyre  pressure  monitoring  system”  in 
Section 2.

Emergency spare wheel
Refer to the information on “Puncture” 
and “Changing a wheel” in Section 5.

Please  be  aware  that  a 
poorly  tightened  or  miss-
ing valve cap can make the 
tyres less airtight and lead 

to pressure loss.
Always use valve caps identical to 
those  fitted  originally  and  tighten 
them fully.

Changing a wheel
As the tyre pressure moni-
tor  may  take  several  min-
utes to correctly determine 
the positions of the wheels and the 
pressure values after driving, check 
the tyre pressures following any op-
eration.

TYRES (3/3)
Fitting new tyres

For your safety, please re-
spect the speed limit.
When  they  need  to  be  re-
placed,  only  tyres  of  the 
same make, size, type and profile 
should be used on a single axle.
They must: either have a load ca-
pacity  and  a  speed  capacity  at 
least equal to the original tyres, 
or  correspond  to  those  recom-
mended  by  your  authorised 
dealer.
Failure  to  heed  these  instructions 
could  endanger  your  safety  and 
affect  your  vehicle’s  roadworthi-
ness.
Risk of loss of control of the ve-
hicle.

Use in winter
Chains
For  safety  reasons,  fitting  snow 
chains to the rear axle is strictly for-
bidden.
Chains cannot be fitted to tyres which 
are larger than those originally fitted to

Snow or Winter tyres
We  would  recommend  that  these  be 
fitted to all four wheels to ensure that 
your  vehicle  retains  maximum  adhe-
sion.
Warning: These tyres sometimes have 
a  specific  direction  of  rotation  and  a 
maximum speed index which may be 
lower than the maximum speed of your 
vehicle.

Snow  chains  may  only  be 
fitted  to  tyres  of  the  same 
size  as  those  originally 
fitted to your vehicle.

Studded tyres
This  type  of  equipment  may  only  be 
used  for  a  limited  period  and  as  laid 
down by local legislation. It is neces-
sary to observe the speed specified by 
current legislation.
These  tyres  must,  at  a  minimum,  be 
fitted to the two front wheels.

In all cases, we would recommend 
that  you  contact  an  authorised 
dealer who will be able to advise you 
on the choice of equipment which is 
most suitable for your vehicle.

18”  wheels  and  larger 
cannot  be  fitted  with 
chains.
If you wish to use special 
equipment,  consult  an  approved 
dealer.

BATTERY: troubleshooting (1/2)
To avoid all risk of sparks:
–  Ensure  that  any  consumers  (cour-
tesy  lights,  etc.)  are  switched  off 
before disconnecting or reconnect-
ing the battery;

–  when  charging,  stop  the  charger 
before connecting or disconnecting 
the battery;

–  to avoid creating a short circuit be-
tween  the  terminals,  do  not  place 
metal objects on the battery;

–  always wait at least one minute after 
the  engine  has  been  switched  off 
before disconnecting a battery;

–  make  sure  that  you  reconnect  the 

battery terminals after refitting.

Before  performing  any 
action  in  the  engine  com-
partment, the ignition must 
be switched off (please see 
the  information  on  “Starting,  stop-
ping the engine” in Section 2).

Connecting a battery charger
The  battery  charger  must  be  com-
patible with a battery with nominal 
voltage of 12 volts.
Do not disconnect the battery when the 
engine is running. Follow the instruc-
tions given by the manufacturer of 
the battery charger you are using.

Special procedures may be 
required  to  charge  some 
batteries. Contact your ap-
proved dealer.

Avoid all risk of sparks which may 
cause an immediate explosion, and 
charge  the  battery  in  a  well  venti-
lated area. Risk of serious injury.

Handle the battery with care 
as it contains sulphuric acid, 
which  must  not  come  into 
contact with eyes or skin. If 
it does, wash the affected area with 
plenty  of  cold  water.  If  necessary, 
consult a doctor.
Keep naked flames, red hot objects 
and  sparks  away  from  the  battery 
components  as  there  is  a  risk  of 
explosion.

Please  note  when  work-
ing close to the engine that 
it  may  be  hot. The  engine 
cooling  fan  may  also  start 
at any moment. The  warning 
light in the engine compartment re-
minds you of this.
Risk of injury.

5.27

BATTERY: troubleshooting (2/2)
Starting the vehicle using the 
battery from another vehicle
If you have to use the battery from an-
other  vehicle  to  start,  obtain  suitable 
jump leads (with a large cross section) 
from an approved dealer or, if you al-
ready  have  jump  leads,  ensure  that 
they are in perfect condition.
The two batteries must have an iden-
tical nominal voltage of 12 volts. The 
battery  supplying  the  current  should 
have a capacity (amp-hours, Ah) which 
is at least the same as that of the dis-
charged battery.
Ensure that there is no risk of contact 
between the two vehicles (risk of short 
circuiting  when  the  positive  terminals 
are connected) and that the discharged 
battery  is  properly  connected.  Switch 
off your vehicle ignition.
Start the engine of the vehicle supply-
ing the current and run it at a moderate 
speed.

Maximum permissible load on roof
* Towing weight (towing a caravan, boat, etc.)
Towing is prohibited when the MTR - MMAC calculation is equal to zero, or when the MTR is equal to zero (or is not listed) on 
the identification plate.
–  It is important to comply with the towing weights, governed by local legislation in each country and, in particular, laid down in 

75 kg (including carrying device)

the Road Traffic Regulations. Contact an approved Dealer about any towing equipment.

–  When towing, under no circumstances may the total train weight (vehicle + trailer) be exceeded. However the following is 

permitted:
–  rear axle MMTA exceeded by no more than 15%,
–  maximum MMAC exceeded by no more than 10% or 100 kg (whichever is reached first).
In either case, the maximum speed of the vehicle and trailer must not exceed 60 mph (100 km/h) and the tyre pressures must 
be increased by 0.2 bar (3 PSI).

–  The engine output and climbing capability are reduced with altitude. We recommend that the maximum load be reduced by 

 

10% at an altitude of 1,000 metres and by an additional 10% for each 1,000 metres thereafter.

6.7

REPLACEMENT PARTS AND REPAIRS
Original parts are based on strict specifications and are subject to highly-specialised tests. Therefore, they are of at least the same 
level of quality as the parts fitted originally.
If you always fit genuine replacement parts to your vehicle, you will ensure that it performs well. Furthermore, repairs carried out 
within the manufacturer’s Network using original parts are guaranteed according to the conditions set out on the reverse of the 
repair order.
