.OverviewEco-driving

Eco-driving is a range of everyday practices that allow the motorist to optimise their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

Optimise the use of your gearbox

With a manual gearbox, move off gently and change up without waiting. 
During acceleration, change up early.

With an automatic gearbox, give preference to automatic mode and 
avoid pressing the accelerator pedal heavily or suddenly.

The gear shift indicator invites you to engage the most suitable gear: 
as soon as the indication is displayed in the instrument panel, follow it 
straight away.
For vehicles fitted with an automatic gearbox, this indicator appears 
only in manual mode.

Drive smoothly
Maintain a safe distance between vehicles, use engine braking rather 
than the brake pedal, and press the accelerator progressively. These 
practices contribute towards a reduction in fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions and also help to reduce the background traffic noise.

If your vehicle has cruise control, make use of the system at speeds 
above 25 mph (40 km/h) when the traffic is flowing well.

Control the use of your electrical 
equipment
Before moving off, if the passenger compartment is too warm, ventilate it 
by opening the windows and air vents before using the air conditioning.
Above 30 mph (50 km/h), close the windows and leave the air vents 
open.
Remember to make use of equipment that can help keep the 
temperature in the passenger compartment down (sunroof, window 
blinds, etc.).
Switch off the air conditioning, unless it has automatic regulation, as 
soon as the desired temperature is attained.
Switch off the demisting and defrosting controls, if not automatic.
Switch off the heated seat as soon as possible.

Switch off the headlamps and front foglamps when the level of light 
does not require their use.

Avoid running the engine before moving off, particularly in winter; your 
vehicle will warm up much faster while driving.

As a passenger, if you avoid connecting your multimedia devices 
(film, music, video game, etc.), you will contribute towards limiting the 
consumption of electrical energy, and so of fuel.
Disconnect your portable devices before leaving the vehicle.

10

Eco-drivingLimit the causes of excess consumption

Spread loads throughout the vehicle; place the heaviest items in the 
bottom of the boot, as close as possible to the rear seats.
Limit the loads carried in the vehicle and reduce wind resistance 
(roof bars, roof rack, bicycle carrier, trailer, etc.). Use a roof box in 
preference.
Remove roof bars and roof racks after use.

At the end of winter, remove snow tyres and refit your summer tyres.

Observe the recommendations on 
maintenance
Check the tyre pressures regularly, when cold, referring to the label in 
the door aperture, on the driver's side.
Carry out this check in particular:
- 
- 
- 
Do not forget the spare wheel and the tyres on any trailer or caravan.

before a long journey,
at each change of season,
after a long period out of use.

Have your vehicle serviced regularly (engine oil, oil filter, air filter, 
passenger compartment filter, etc.) and observe the schedule of 
operations recommended in the manufacturer's service schedule.

When refuelling, do not continue after the third cut-off of the nozzle to 
avoid any overflow.

At the wheel of your new vehicle, it is only after the first 1 800 miles 
(3 000 kilometres) that you will see the fuel consumption settle down to 
a consistent average.

InstrumentsService indicator
System which informs the driver when the 
next service is due, in accordance with the 
manufacturer's servicing schedule.
The point at which the next service is due is 
calculated from the last service indicator zero 
reset.
It is determined by two parameters:
- 
- 

the distance travelled (in miles (km)),
the time elapsed since the last service 
(in months).

The distance remaining to be travelled may be 
weighted by the time factor, depending on the 
use made of the vehicle.

Operation
When the ignition is switched on, you must press 
the INFO button several times in succession 
until the service indicator is displayed. The 
distance recorder display line indicates the 
number of miles or kilometres remaining and 
the time elapsed line indicates the number of 
months remaining before the next service is due.

Service overdue
Each time the ignition is switched on, the 
"ROUTINE MAINTENANCE REQUIRED" symbol 
is displayed for a few seconds to indicate that the 
service must be carried out without delay.

Example: the screen indicates that the service 
is overdue. This service must be carried out by 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.

Example: the screen indicates that 7300 miles 
(kilometres) remain before the next service is 
due.

The symbol "--" remains displayed until 
the first service of a new vehicle has 
been carried out.

1InstrumentsResetting the service indicator to 
zero
Your CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop 
carries out this operation after each service.
If you have carried out your vehicle's service 
yourself, the zero reset procedure is the 
following:
F  switch off the ignition,
F  press the INFO button several times in 
succession until the service indicator is 
displayed,

F  press and hold the INFO button for a few 

seconds until the spanner flashes,

F  press the INFO button while the spanner 
is flashing to change the display "---" to 
"CLEAR" then the time remaining before 
the next service is due is displayed.

After a certain distance and a certain 
time, the display of "---" is reset 
automatically and the display indicates 
the time remaining before the next 
service is due.

InstrumentsCoolant temperature  
gauge

Range

When the engine is 
running, this indicates the 
temperature of the coolant.

When the engine is 
running, this indicates 
the distance which can 
still be travelled with the 
fuel remaining in the tank 
based on the average 
fuel consumption over the 
last few miles/kilometres 
travelled.

When the range is less than 30 miles (50 km), 
dashes are displayed.
Refuel as soon as possible. The display of the 
range is updated.

If the bar is close to the critical position located 
on the right, the temperature is too high.
The symbol flashes when your engine is 
overheating.
You must stop your vehicle as soon as it is 
safe to do so.
Wait a few minutes before switching off the 
engine.

Wait for the engine to cool before 
topping up the level. The cooling system 
is pressurised.
To avoid any risk of scalding, unscrew 
the cap by two turns to allow the 
pressure to drop.
When the pressure has dropped, 
remove the cap and top up the level, 
if necessary.
Contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

This value may vary following a change 
in the style of driving or the relief, 
resulting in a large variation in the 
current fuel consumption.
If you only add a few litres, the value 
displayed will be incorrect. Therefore, 
you must fill the tank whenever 
possible.

When you disconnect the battery, 
the previous fuel consumption data 
is lost and the value displayed will be 
different from that displayed before the 
battery was disconnected. The distance 
displayed must be considered an 
approximate indication.

Ease of use and comfortVentilation
Air intake
The air circulating in the passenger compartment 
is filtered and originates either from the outside via 
the grille located at the base of the windscreen or 
from the inside in air recirculation mode.

Air treatment
The incoming air follows various routes 
depending on the controls selected by the 
driver:
- 

direct arrival in the passenger 
compartment (air intake),
passage through a heating circuit (heating),
passage through a cooling circuit (air 
conditioning).

3Ease of use and comfortRecommendations for ventilation and air conditioning

In order for these systems to be fully effective, follow the operation and maintenance 
guidelines below:
F  To obtain an even air distribution, take care not to obstruct the exterior air intake grilles 
located at the base of the windscreen, the nozzles, the vents and the air outlets, as well 
as the air extractor located in the boot.

F  Do not cover the sunshine sensor, located on the dashboard; this is used for regulation 

of the air conditioning system.

F  Operate the air conditioning system for at least 5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a month 

to keep it in perfect working order.

F  Ensure that the passenger compartment filter is in good condition and have the filter 

elements replaced regularly.

  We recommend the use of a combined passenger compartment filter. Thanks to its 

special active additive, it contributes to the purification of the air breathed by the 
occupants and the cleanliness of the passenger compartment (reduction of allergic 
symptoms, bad odours and greasy deposits).

F  To ensure correct operation of the air conditioning system, you are also advised to have 

F 

it checked regularly as recommended in the maintenance and warranty guide.
If the system does not produce cold air, switch it off and contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

When towing the maximum load on a steep gradient in high temperatures, switching off the 
air conditioning increases the available engine power and so improves the towing ability.

If after an extended stop in sunshine, 
the interior temperature is very high, first 
ventilate the passenger compartment for 
a few moments.
Put the air flow control at a setting high 
enough to quickly change the air in the 
passenger compartment.

Humid air cooled quickly by the 
vehicle's air conditioning system may 
produce condensation at the vent 
outlets.
This phenomenon disappears after a 
few seconds.

The condensation created by the air 
conditioning results in a discharge 
of water under the vehicle which is 
perfectly normal.

Observe the driving regulations and remain 
vigilant whatever the traffic conditions.
Pay close attention to the traffic and keep your 
hands on the wheel so that you are ready to 
react at any time to any eventuality.
On a long journey, a break every two hours is 
strongly recommended.
In difficult weather, drive smoothly, anticipate 
the need to brake and increase the distance 
from other vehicles.

Driving on flooded roads

We strongly advise against driving on flooded 
roads, as this could cause serious damage 
to the engine or gearbox, as well as to the 
electrical systems of your vehicle.

Never drive in a depth of water which 
could cover the axles, the wheel shafts 
and which could enter the exhaust.

If you are obliged to drive through water:

Important!

- 

- 
- 

- 

check that the depth of water does not 
exceed 25 cm, taking account of waves 
that might be generated by other users,
deactivate the Stop & Start system,
drive as slowly as possible without 
stalling. In all cases, do not exceed 6 mph 
(10 km/h),
do not stop and do not switch off the 
engine.

On leaving the flooded road, as soon as 
circumstances allow, make several light brake 
applications to dry the brake discs and pads.
If in doubt on the state of your vehicle, contact 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.

Never drive with the parking brake 
applied - Risk of overheating and 
damage to the braking system!
Risk of fire!
As the exhaust system of your vehicle 
is very hot, even several minutes after 
switching off the engine, do not park 
or run the engine over areas where 
inflammable substances and materials 
are present: grass, leaves, etc.

Never leave a vehicle unsupervised 
with the engine running. If you have 
to leave your vehicle with the engine 
running, apply the parking brake 
and put the gearbox into neutral or 
position N or P, depending on the type 
of gearbox.

4DrivingGear shift indicator*

System which reduces fuel consumption by advising the driver to change gear on vehicles fitted with a manual gearbox.

Operation
The system intervenes only when driving 
economically.
Depending on the driving situation and your 
vehicle's equipment, the system may advise 
you to skip one or more gears. You can 
follow this instruction without engaging the 
intermediate gears.
The gear recommendations should not 
be considered compulsory. In fact, the 
configuration of the road, the amount of traffic 
and safety remain determining factors when 
choosing the best gear. Therefore, the driver 
remains responsible for deciding whether or not 
to follow the advice given by the system.
This function cannot be deactivated.

A symbol appears in the instrument panel 
when the system suggests changing to a more 
suitable gear:

- 

for a change up,

or

- 

for a change down.

In the case of driving which makes 
particular demands on the performance 
of the engine (firm pressure on the 
accelerator pedal, for example, when 
overtaking...), the system will not 
recommend a gear change.
The system never suggests engaging 
reverse gear.

of the gears by the gearbox and therefore 
without any action on the part of the driver,
a manual mode for sequential changing of 
the gears by the driver using the steering 
mounted controls or the gear lever.

- 

The mode can be changed at any time.

It includes the following controls:
- 

a gear lever 1 on the centre console for 
selecting the driving mode, reverse gear

4DrivingOperation

Hill start assist

System which keeps your vehicle immobilised 
temporarily (approximately 2 seconds) when 
starting on a gradient, the time it takes to 
move your foot from the brake pedal to the 
accelerator pedal.
This function is only active when:
- 

the vehicle is completely stationary, with 
your foot on the brake pedal,

-  when certain conditions of gradient are 

met,

-  with the driver’s door closed.
The hill start assist function cannot be 
deactivated.

When the engine is not running, 
including periods on standby with 
the Stop & Start (AS&G) system, the 
function is not operative.

- 

Do not leave the vehicle while it is being 
held in the hill start assist phase.
If you need to leave the vehicle while 
the engine is running, apply the parking 
brake.

110

On an ascending slope, with the vehicle 
stationary, the vehicle is held for a brief 
moment when you release the brake pedal:
- 

if you are in first gear or neutral with a 
manual gearbox,
if you are in position D with the CVT 
gearbox.

On a descending slope, with the vehicle 
stationary and reverse gear engaged, the 
vehicle is held for a brief moment when you 
release the brake pedal.

Operating fault

If a fault occurs with the system, this warning 
lamp comes on, accompanied by a message 
in the instrument panel screen. Contact a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop to 
have the system checked.

DrivingStop & Start (Auto Stop & Go) system

The Stop & Start (Auto Stop & Go) system puts the engine temporarily into standby during stops in the traffic (red lights, traffic jams, etc.). The engine 
restarts automatically as soon as you want to move off. The restart takes place instantly, quickly and silently.
Perfect for urban use, the Stop & Start (Auto Stop & Go) system reduces fuel consumption and exhaust emissions as well as the noise level when 
stationary.

Operation
Going into engine STOP mode

The "AS&G" warning lamp comes on in 
the instrument panel or the instrument 
panel screen and the engine goes into 
standby after a few seconds:

-  with a manual gearbox, with the vehicle 

stationary and your foot on the brake, when 
you put the gear lever into neutral and 
release the clutch pedal.

If you move the gear lever, the "AS&G" 
warning lamp flashes, accompanied by 
an audible signal.
The alert stops as soon as the gear 
lever is returned to the neutral position.

When the engine is stopped 
automatically, the operation of certain 
vehicle systems, such as braking 
and power steering for example, are 
modified. Take care.

Never refuel with the engine in STOP 
mode; you must switch off the ignition 
with the key or the START/STOP 
button.

When driving, prolonged pressing of the 
clutch pedal may cause a malfunction 
of the Stop & Start (Auto Stop & Go) 
system.

The system is active again; this is confirmed by 
the "AS&G OFF" warning lamp going off in the 
instrument panel or instrument panel screen.

The system is reactivated automatically 
at every new start using the key or the 
START/STOP button.

Opening the bonnet
Before carrying out any work under the 
bonnet, deactivate Stop & Start to avoid 
any risk of injury caused by automatic 
triggering of START mode.

In the event of a malfunction with the system, 
the "AS&G OFF" warning lamp flashes in the 
instrument panel or instrument panel screen, 
and the system no longer operates.
Have it checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

In the event of a fault in STOP mode, the 
vehicle may stall. The following warning lamps 
come on in the instrument panel or instrument 
panel screen:

It is then necessary to switch off the ignition, 
then restart the engine using the key or the 
START/STOP button.

113

4DrivingUnder-inflation detection

System which continuously and automatically checks the pressures of the four tyres after switching on the ignition.
A pressure sensor is located in the valve of each tyre (except the spare wheel).
The system triggers an alert if a drop in pressure is detected in one or more tyres, compared to the reference pressure registered in the system. This 
reference pressure must be reinitialised every time the tyre pressures are adjusted or a wheel changed.
The system operates on condition that the sensor identifiers have first been memorised in the system by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.
You can memorise two sets of tyres (e.g. wheels with "standard" tyres and wheels with "winter" tyres).

The tyre under-inflation detection 
system is an aid to driving which does 
not replace the need for vigilance on 
the part of the driver.

This system does not avoid the need 
to check the tyre pressures regularly 
(including the spare wheel) and before 
a long journey.
Driving with under-inflated tyres 
adversely affects road holding, 
extends braking distances and causes 
premature tyre wear, particularly under 
arduous conditions (vehicle loaded, 
high speed, long journey).

The tyre pressures for your vehicle can 
be found on the tyre pressure label.
For more information on Identification 
markings, refer to the corresponding 
section.
The tyre pressures must be checked 
when the tyres are cold (vehicle 
stopped for 1 hour or after driving for 
less then 6 miles (10 km) at moderate 
speed). Otherwise, add 0.3 bar to the 
values indicated on the label.

Driving with under-inflated tyres 
increases fuel consumption.

114

DrivingUnder-inflation alert

The alert is given by the fixed 
illumination of this warning lamp and 
the display of a message.

F  Reduce speed immediately, avoid sudden 

steering movements or harsh brake 
applications.

F  Stop as soon as it is safe to do so.

F 

 

 
F 

If you have a compressor (the one in the 
temporary puncture repair kit, for example), 
check the four tyre pressures when cold.
If it is not possible to check the tyre 
pressures immediately, drive carefully at 
reduced speed.
or
In the event of a puncture, use the 
temporary puncture repair kit or the spare 
wheel (depending on equipment).

Reinitialising the reference 
pressure

Before reinitialising the system, ensure 
that the pressures in the four tyres are 
suitable for the conditions of use of the 
vehicle and are as specified on the tyre 
pressure label.
The under-inflation detection system 
cannot warn of an incorrect pressure at 
the time of reinitialisation.

The loss of pressure detected does not 
always lead to visible deformation of the 
tyre. Do not rely on just a visual check.

The alert is maintained until the 
reference pressure is reinitialised after 
the inflation, repair or replacement of 
the tyres concerned. In the event of 
the repair or replacement of tyres, the 
sensor identifiers must be registered in 
the system by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
The spare wheel does not have 
a sensor, so there is no need to 
reinitialise the system for driving with 
the spare wheel fitted.

The system must be reinitialised after any 
adjustment of tyre pressures and after 
changing one or more wheels.

115

4DrivingThe reinitialisation instruction is entered in 
the screen menu, with the ignition in the "ON" 
position and the vehicle stationary.

Operating fault

The flashing and then fixed illumination of the 
under-inflation warning lamp accompanied by 
the display of a message indicates a fault with 
the system.
In this case, monitoring of the tyre pressures is 
not assured.

This alert is also displayed if:
- 

at least one wheel is not fitted with a 
sensor (spare wheel in use),
a wireless device operating on the same 
frequency is close to the vehicle,
there are accumulations of snow or ice in 
the wings or wheels,
the state of charge of the tyre pressure 
monitoring system battery is too low,
the wheel sensor identifiers have not been 
memorised in the system by a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

- 

- 

- 

- 

F  Press several times on the INFO button, 
located below the instrument panel to the 
left of the steering wheel.

F  Select "REINITIALISE" (located in 
menu 2/3 or 3/3 depending on the 
instrument panel).

F  Press and hold the INFO button for at least 
3 seconds to reinitialise the under-inflation 
detection system.

Reinitialisation of the system is confirmed 
by the flashing of the warning lamp in the 
instrument panel.

116

Go to a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked 
or, after a puncture, to have the original 
wheel, equipped with a sensor, refitted.

The under-inflation alert is only reliable 
if the system has been reinitialised 
with the four tyre pressures correctly 
adjusted.

Any tyre repair or replacement on a 
wheel fitted with this system must be 
carried out by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
If you fit the second set of tyres 
memorised in the system, a fault will 
be signalled until the second set is 
selected in the configuration menu.

DrivingManaging sets of tyres

If you have had a second set of tyres registered 
by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop, 
every time you change the set of tyres (fitting 
a set of winter tyres, for example), you must 
select the set you have just fitted in the 
configuration menu.

Selection of the other set of tyres is done via 
the menu screen, with the ignition on and the 
vehicle stationary.
F  Press several times on the INFO button to 
select the menu for managing sets of tyres 
(located in menu 3/3).

The system automatically reinitialises 
the reference pressure based on the 
pressure in the new set (the under-
inflation detection warning lamp flashes 
during the operation).

After fitting the new set of tyres, you 
should check and adjust the tyre 
pressures to the values specified on the 
tyre pressure label.
For more information on Identification 
markings and in particular the 
tyre pressure label, refer to the 
corresponding section.

F  Press and hold the INFO button for at least 

3 seconds to change successively from 
set of tyres 1 to set of tyres 2 or the other 
way round.

4DrivingFour wheel drive system

System which permits the selection of a transmission mode in relation to the driving conditions.
Three transmission modes are available and can be selected manually by the driver in accordance with his requirements.

Selecting the transmission 
mode
4WD AUTO (position 1)
The vehicle operates with four wheel drive and 
provides optimum traction for all levels of grip.
This is the vehicle's normal and regular 
operating mode, the distribution of the torque 
between the front and rear axles is controlled 
automatically.
The distribution favours the front wheels, 
the transfer of torque to the rear wheels is 
managed electronically by the control unit 
in relation to the level of grip, so providing 
optimum road holding.

4WD LOCK (position 2)
The vehicle operates with four wheel drive in 
this mode also.
It is recommended when grip is particularly 
poor or difficult (sand, mud, slopes, ...).

2WD (position 3)
The vehicle operates with front two wheel drive.
This is suitable for use on a tarmac roads or 
where the driver considers that there is no risk 
of loss of grip (dry road).

The selection of this mode is 
recommended when the level of grip 
permits.

Display in the instrument panel

The transmission mode is displayed in the 
form of an intermittent display in the instrument 
panel screen when the transmission mode is 
selected.

You can change transmission mode when 
stationary or while driving.
The transmission mode can be selected by 
turning the control A.

118

DrivingAs the engine torque is applied to all 
four wheels, the condition of the tyres 
has a considerable impact on the 
performance of the vehicle.
Ensure that all four tyres are in good 
condition.
Avoid driving the vehicle in sandy or 
muddy areas or in other areas in which 
the wheels could spin.
Spinning the wheels places the 
transmission components under 
pressure and could cause a serious 
malfunction.
Do not drive the vehicle through deep 
water.
Avoid driving over excessively uneven 
terrain (risk of scraping under the body 
or of grounding on crossing a bridge).

Have your vehicle towed on a 
flatbed.
The vehicle must not be towed with the 
front or rear wheels on the ground even 
if it is in front "2WD" (2 wheel drive) 
mode.

If the replacement of a tyre is 
necessary on 4-wheel drive versions, 
it is recommended that all four tyres be 
replaced at the same time, ensuring 
that the same make, model and size is 
used on all wheels.
This is because using tyres of different 
sizes, structure or rate of wear could 
damage transmission components.

Operating faults
If the selected transmission mode display 
flashes, the vehicle switches automatically to 
front "2WD" transmission mode.
It is then no longer possible to select the 
transmission mode using the control A.
If the message "SLOW DOWN" is displayed on 
the instrument panel, let the transmission cool 
down then wait for the display to clear before 
setting off again.
If "4WD" and "LOCK" are displayed alternately 
and if "SERVICE REQUIRED" is displayed in 
the instrument panel, the system has failed and 
the safety system has been activated.
Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop without delay.

119

4DrivingCruise control

System which automatically maintains the vehicle speed at the value programmed by the driver, without any action on the accelerator pedal.

The cruise control is switched on manually: 
the vehicle speed must be at least 25 mph 
(40 km/h) and second gear or higher must be 
engaged in the case of a manual gearbox.

The cruise control is switched off manually, by 
an action on the brake or clutch pedal or if the 
ASC system is triggered.

The programmed speed can be exceeded 
temporarily by pressing the accelerator pedal.

To return to the programmed speed, simply 
release the accelerator pedal.
Switching off the ignition cancels any 
programmed speed value.

The cruise control cannot, in any 
circumstances, take the place of the 
need to comply with speed limits or of 
the vigilance of the driver.

from exceeding the programmed speed.
To prevent the mat from becoming 
caught under the pedals:
- 

ensure that the mat is positioned 
correctly,
never fit one mat on top of another.

DrivingParking sensors

Rear parking sensors

This system indicates the proximity of an 
obstacle (person, vehicle, tree, gate, etc.) 
which comes within the field of detection of 
sensors located in the bumper.
Certain types of obstacle (stake, roadworks 
cone, etc.) detected initially will no longer be 
detected at the end of the manoeuvre due to 
the presence of blind spots.

Audible assistance
The proximity information is given by an 
intermittent audible signal, whose frequency 
increases as the vehicle approaches the 
obstacle.
Below a certain distance between the vehicle 
and the obstacle, the audible signal becomes 
continuous.

This function cannot, in any 
circumstances, take the place of the 
vigilance of the driver.

The system is switched on by engaging reverse 
gear. This is accompanied by an audible signal.
The indicator lamp in the button comes on to 
confirm that the system is active.
The system is deactivated when you come out 
of reverse gear.

123

124

The detection zone modification information is 
indicated by an audible signal:
- 

double signal on vehicles fitted with a 
towbar,
single signal on vehicles which are not 
fitted with a towbar.

DrivingVisual assistance

This supplements the audible 
signal by displaying bars in the 
screen, in front of or behind the 
vehicle.

These bars flash at the start of the manoeuvre 
then become fixed from a certain distance 
between the vehicle and the obstacle.

Front parking sensors

The front parking sensors are triggered when 
an obstacle is detected in front, a gear is 
engaged (position D for vehicles with a CVT 
gearbox) and the speed of the vehicle remains 
below 6 mph (10 km/h).
The front parking sensors are interrupted if 
the vehicle stops for more than five seconds 
in forward gear, if no further obstacles are 
detected or when the speed of the vehicle 
exceeds 6 mph (10 km/h).

Deactivation / Activation of the 
front and rear parking sensors
The function is deactivated by pressing this 
button. The indicator lamp in the button 
goes off.
Pressing this button again reactivates the 
function. The indicator lamp in the button 
comes on.

Remember to deactivate the system if 
towing a trailer or caravan.

Operating fault

In the event of an problem, when reverse gear 
is engaged this lamp in the button flashes, 
accompanied by an audible signal.

If one of the sensors is faulty, it 
flashes in the instrument panel 
screen.

Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

In bad weather or in winter, ensure that 
the sensors are not covered with mud, 
ice or snow.
When the vehicle is moving at a speed 
below 6 mph (10 km/h), certain sound 
sources (motorcycle, lorry, pneumatic 
drill, etc.) may trigger the audible 
signals of the parking sensor system.

125

4DrivingReversing camera

Linked with the navigation option, the reversing 
camera complements the parking sensor 
system and is activated automatically when 
reverse gear is engaged.

The image from the camera is displayed in the 
navigation screen.
The zone (A) represents the upper part of the 
rear bumper.
The red line represents the distance of 50 cm 
from the edge of the rear bumper.
The green lines represent the width of the 
vehicle increased by 20 cm on each side.
The marks on the green lines correspond to the 
edges of the rear bumper (B), then the distance 
of 1 metre from the edge of the rear bumper (C) 
and 2 metres (D).

126

In no circumstances can the reversing 
camera replace the need for vigilance 
on the part of the driver.

Clean the reversing camera from time 
to time using a soft dry cloth.

High pressure jet wash
When washing your vehicle, do not 
direct the lance to within 30 cm of the 
camera lens.

DrivingLighting controls

Stalk for selecting and switching the vehicle's 
front and rear exterior lamps.

In some weather conditions (e.g. low 
temperature or humidity), the presence 
of misting on the internal surface of the 
glass of the headlamps and rear lamps 
is normal; it disappears after the lamps 
have been on for a few minutes.

Main lighting
The various front and rear lamps of the vehicle 
are designed to adapt the lighting progressively 
in relation to the climatic conditions and so 
ensure the best visibility for the driver:
- 
- 

sidelamps, to be seen,
dipped beam headlamps to see without 
dazzling other drivers,

-  main beam headlamps to see clearly when 

the road is clear.

Additional lighting
Other lamps are provided to fulfil the 
requirements of particular driving conditions:
rear foglamps to be seen from a distance,
- 
front foglamps for even better visibility,

Trajectory control systems

Safety

traction control (TCl),
active stability control (ASC).

Associated systems which contribute to the directional stability of the vehicle within the limits of the laws of physics:
- 
- 
Traction control and active stability control
Traction control optimises traction to prevent 
wheel spin, by acting on the brakes of the 
driving wheels and on the engine.
Active stability control acts on the brake of one 
or more wheels and on the engine to keep the 
vehicle on the trajectory required by the driver.

Activation
These systems are activated automatically 
each time the vehicle is started.

Deactivation
In exceptional conditions (starting a vehicle 
which is bogged down, stuck in snow, on soft 
ground, ...), it may be advisable to deactivate 
the ASC system, so that the wheels can move 
freely and regain grip.

The driver must ensure that passengers use 
the seat belts correctly and that they are all 
fastened before setting off.
Wherever you are seated in the vehicle, 
always fasten your seat belt, even for short 
journeys.
Do not interchange the seat belt buckles as 
they will not fulfill their role fully.
The seat belts are fitted with an inertia reel 
permitting automatic adjustment of the 
length of the strap to your size. The seat belt 
is stowed automatically when not in use.
Before and after use, ensure that the seat 
belt is reeled in correctly.
The lower part of the strap must be 
positioned as low as possible on the pelvis.
The upper part must be positioned in the 
hollow of the shoulder.
The inertia reels are fitted with an automatic 
locking device which comes into operation in 
the event of a collision, emergency braking 
or if the vehicle rolls over. You can release 
the device by pulling the strap firmly and 
then releasing it so that it reels in slightly.

- 

In order to be effective, a seat belt must:
be tightened as close to the body as 
- 
possible,
be pulled in front of you with a smooth 
movement, checking that it does not 
twist,
be used to restrain only one person,
not bear any trace of cuts or fraying,
not be converted or modified to avoid 
affecting its performance.

- 
- 
- 

In accordance with current safety 
regulations, for all repairs on your vehicle's 
seat belts, go to a qualified workshop with 
the skills and equipment needed, which a 
CITROËN dealer is able to provide.
Have your seat belts checked regularly by 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop, 
particularly if the straps show signs of 
damage.
Clean the seat belt straps with soapy 
water or a textile cleaning product, sold by 
CITROËN dealers.
After folding or moving a seat or rear bench 
seat, ensure that the seat belt is positioned 
and reeled in correctly.

Recommendations for children
Use a suitable child seat if the passenger is 
less than 12 years old or shorter than one 
and a half metres.
Never use the same seat belt to secure more 
than one person.
Never allow a child to travel on your lap.
For more information on Child seats, refer 
to the corresponding section.

In the event of an impact
Depending on the nature and 
seriousness of the impact, the 
pretensioning device may be deployed 
before and independently of the airbags. 
Deployment of the pretensioners is 
accompanied by a slight discharge of 
harmless smoke and a noise, due to the 
activation of the pyrotechnic cartridge 
incorporated in the system.
In all cases, the airbag warning lamp comes on.
Following an impact, have the seat belts 
system checked, and if necessary replaced, 
by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

SafetyAirbags
General information
System designed to contribute towards 
improving the safety of the occupants (with 
the exception of the rear centre passenger) 
in the event of violent collisions. The airbags 
supplement the action of the seat belts fitted 
with force limiters (all except the centre rear 
passenger belt).
If a collision occurs, the electronic detectors 
record and analyse the front and side impacts 
sustained in the impact detection zones:
- 

in the case of a serious impact, the airbags 
are deployed instantly and contribute 
towards better protection of the occupants 
of the vehicle (with the exception of the 
rear centre passenger); immediately after 
the impact, the airbags deflate rapidly so 
that they do not hinder visibility or the exit 
of the occupants,
in the case of a minor or rear impact or in 
certain roll-over conditions, the airbags 
may not be deployed; the seat belt 
alone contributes towards ensuring your 
protection in these situations.

- 

The airbags do not operate when the 
ignition is switched off.
This equipment will only deploy once. 
If a second impact occurs (during the 
same or a subsequent accident), the 
airbag will not be deployed again.

Front airbags

Impact detection zones
A.  Front impact zone.
B.  Side impact zone.

Deployment of one or more of the 
airbags is accompanied by a slight 
emission of smoke and a noise, due 
to the activation of the pyrotechnic 
cartridge incorporated in the system.
This smoke is not harmful, but sensitive 
individuals may experience slight 
irritation.
The noise of detonation associated with 
the deployment of one or more airbags 
may result in a slight loss of hearing for 
a short time.

System which contributes toward improving 
protection for the head and chest of the driver 
and front passenger in the event of a front 
impact.
The driver's airbag is fitted in the centre of the 
steering wheel; the front passenger's airbag is 
fitted in the dashboard above the glove box.
Deployment
The airbags are deployed, except the 
passenger's front airbag if it is deactivated, 
in the event of a serious front impact applied 
to all or part of the front impact zone A, in 
the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle on a 
horizontal plane and directed from the front to 
the rear of the vehicle.
The front airbag inflates between the front 
occupant of the vehicle and the dashboard to 
cushion their forward movement.

151

6SafetyTo ensure the safety of your child, the 
passenger's airbag must be deactivated 
when you install a "rearward facing" 
child seat on the front passenger seat.
Otherwise, the child would risk being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag 
were triggered.

Reactivation
When you remove the "rearward facing" child 
seat, turn switch A to the "ON" position to 
reactivate the airbag and so ensure the safety 
of your front passenger in the event of an 
impact.
The associated warning lamp goes off.

Operating fault

If this warning lamp comes on in the 
instrument panel, accompanied by a 
message, contact a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop without delay 
to have the system checked. The 
airbags may no longer be deployed in 
the event of a serious impact.

If the airbag warning lamp and the 
display come on continuously, do not

The lateral airbag is deployed unilaterally in the 
event of a serious side impact applied to all or 
part of the side impact zone B, perpendicular 
to the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle on a 
horizontal plane and directed from the outside 
towards the inside of the vehicle.
The lateral airbag inflates between the front 
occupant of the vehicle and the corresponding 
door trim panel.

153

6SafetyCurtain airbags

Deployment
The curtain airbag is deployed at the same 
time as the corresponding lateral airbag in the 
event of a serious side impact applied to all or 
part of the side impact zone B, perpendicular 
to the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle on a 
horizontal plane and directed from the outside 
towards the inside of the vehicle.
The curtain airbag inflates between the front or 
rear occupant of the vehicle and the windows.

System which contributes towards 
improving protection for the driver 
and passengers (with the exception 
of the rear centre passenger) in the event of a 
serious side impact in order to limit the risk of 
injury to the head.
Each curtain airbag is fitted in the pillars 
and the upper section of the passenger 
compartment.

In the event of a minor impact or bump 
on the side of the vehicle or if the 
vehicle rolls over, the airbag may not be 
deployed.
In the event of a rear or front collision, 
the airbag is not deployed.

Operating fault
If this warning lamp comes on in the instrument 
panel and this display appears in the 
instrument panel screen, contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop to have the 
system checked. The airbags may no longer be 
deployed in the event of a serious impact.

154

SafetyAdvice
For the airbags to be fully 
effective, observe the safety 
recommendations below:
Sit in a normal upright position.
Wear a correctly adjusted seat belt.
Do not leave anything between the 
occupants and the airbags (a child, pet, 
object...), nor fix or attach anything close to 
the inflation trajectory of the airbags; this 
could cause injuries during their deployment.
Never modify the original definition of your 
vehicle, particularly in the area directly 
around the airbags.
After an accident or if the vehicle has been 
stolen or broken into, have the airbag 
systems checked.
All work on the airbag system must be 
carried out by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
Even if all of the precautions mentioned 
are observed, a risk of injury or of minor 
burns to the head, chest or arms when an 
airbag is deployed cannot be ruled out. The 
bag inflates almost instantly (within a few 
milliseconds) then deflates within the same 
time discharging the hot gas via openings 
provided for this purpose.

Front airbags
Do not drive holding the steering wheel by its 
spokes or resting your hands on the centre 
part of the wheel.
Passengers must not place their feet on the 
dashboard.
Do not smoke as deployment of the airbags 
can cause burns or the risk of injury from a 
cigarette or pipe.
Never remove or pierce the steering wheel or 
hit it violently.
Do not fit or attach anything to the steering 
wheel or dashboard, this could cause 
injuries with deployment of the airbags.

Knee airbag*
Do not sit with your knees any nearer to the 
steering wheel than necessary.

Avoid attaching a heavy object to the key as 
it could become a dangerous projectile if the 
airbag were deployed.

* Depending on country of sale.

Lateral airbags
Use only approved covers on the seats, 
compatible with the deployment the lateral 
airbags. For information on the range of seat 
covers suitable for your vehicle, you can 
contact a CITROËN dealer.
Do not fix or attach anything to the seat 
backs (clothing...). This could cause injury 
to the chest or arms if the lateral airbag is 
deployed.
Do not sit with the upper part of the body any 
nearer to the door than necessary.
Curtain airbags
Do not fix or attach anything to the roof. This 
could cause injury to the head if the curtain 
airbag is deployed.
If fitted on your vehicle, do not remove the 
grab handles installed on the roof, they play 
a part in securing the curtain airbags.

6SafetyGeneral points relating to child seats

Although one of CITROËN's main criteria when designing your vehicle, the safety of your children 
also depends on you.

For maximum safety, please observe the 
following recommendations:
- 

in accordance with European regulations, 
all children under the age of 12 or less 
than one and a half metres tall must 
travel in approved child seats suited to 
their weight, on seats fitted with a seat 
belt or ISOFIX mountings*,
statistically, the safest seats in your 
vehicle for carrying children are the 
rear seats,
a child weighing less than 9 kg must 
travel in the rearward facing position 
both in the front and in the rear.

- 

- 

156

CITROËN recommends that children 
should travel on the rear seats of your 
vehicle:
- 
- 

rearward facing up to the age of 3,
forward facing over the age of 3.

*  The regulations on carrying children are 

specific to each country. Refer to the 
legislation in force in your country.

SafetyChild seat in the front*
Rearward facing

Forward facing

When a rearward facing child seat is installed 
on the front passenger seat, adjust the seat 
to the intermediate longitudinal and highest 
position, with the backrest straightened.
The passenger's front airbag must be 
deactivated. Otherwise, the child risks being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag were 
to inflate.

When a forward facing child seat is installed 
on the front passenger seat, adjust the 
vehicle's seat to the intermediate longitudinal 
and highest position with seat backrest 
straightened and leave the passenger's front 
airbag activated.

Passenger seat adjusted to the intermediate 
longitudinal position.

Ensure that the seat belt is correctly 
tensioned.
For child seats with a support leg, 
ensure that the support leg is in stable 
contact with the floor. If necessary, 
adjust the passenger seat.

*  Refer to the current legislation in your country 

before installing a child seat on this seat.

157

6SafetyDeactivating the passenger's front airbag

Never install a rearward facing child 
restraint system on a seat protected by 
an active front airbag. This could cause 
the death of the child or serious injury.

The warning label present on both sides of the 
passenger's sun visor repeats this advice. In 
line with current legislation, the following tables 
contain this warning in all of the languages 
required.

Passenger airbag OFF

Only the passenger's front airbag can 
be deactivated.
F  With the ignition off, introduce 

the key into the passenger airbag 
deactivation switch.

F  Turn it to the "OFF" position.
F  Remove the key, leaving the switch 

in this position.

When the ignition is on, this warning 
lamp comes on in the instrument 
panel and stays on while the airbag is 
deactivated.

SafetyChild seat at the rear
Rearward facing
When a rearward facing child seat is installed 
on a rear passenger seat, move the vehicle's 
front seat forward and straighten the backrest 
so that the rearward facing child seat does not 
touch the vehicle's front seat.

Forward facing
When a forward facing child seat is installed 
on a rear passenger seat, move the vehicle's 
front seat forward and straighten the backrest 
so that the legs of the child in the forward 
facing child seat do not touch the vehicle's front 
seat.

Centre rear seat
A child seat with a support leg must never be 
installed on the centre rear passenger seat.

The incorrect installation of a child seat 
in a vehicle compromises the protection 
of the child in the event of an accident.

Remove and stow the head restraint 
before installing a child seat with a 
backrest on a passenger seat. Refit the 
head restraint once the child seat has 
been removed.

Ensure that the seat belt is correctly 
tensioned.
For child seats with a support leg, 
ensure that this is in firm contact with 
the floor. If necessary, adjust the front

Safety"ISOFIX" mountings

Your vehicle has been approved in accordance with the latest ISOFIX regulation.
The seats, represented below, are fitted with regulation ISOFIX mountings:

There are three rings for each seat:

- 

two rings A, located between the seat 
backrest and cushion, indicated by a 
marking,

- 

a ring B, located behind the seat and 
identified by a marking, referred to as the 
Top Tether for fixing the upper strap.

This ISOFIX mounting system provides fast, 
reliable and safe fitting of the child seat in your 
vehicle.
The ISOFIX child seats are fitted with 
two latches which are secured on the two 
rings A.
Some seats also have an upper strap, known 
as the Top Tether, which is attached to ring B.

165

6Safety- 

To secure the child seat to the TOP TETHER:
remove and stow the head restraint before 
- 
installing the child seat on the seat (refit it 
once the child seat has been removed),
pass the upper strap of the child seat 
behind the seat backrest, centring it 
between the apertures for the head 
restraint rods,
fix the hook of the upper strap to the ring B,
tighten the upper strap.

- 
- 

When fitting an ISOFIX child seat to the left-
hand rear seat of the benchseat, before fitting 
the seat, first move the centre rear seat belt 
towards the middle of the vehicle, so as to 
avoid the seat interfering with the operation of 
the seat belt.

The incorrect installation of a child seat 
in a vehicle compromises the child's 
protection in the event of an accident.

Strictly follow the fitting instructions provided in 
the user guide supplied with the child seat.

6SafetyAdvice on child seats

The incorrect installation of a child seat in a 
vehicle compromises the child's protection in 
the event of an accident.
Remember to fasten the seat belts or the 
child seat harnesses keeping the slack in 
relation to the child's body to a minimum, 
even for short journeys.
For optimum installation of the forward 
facing child seat, ensure that the back of the 
child seat is in contact with the back of the 
vehicle's seat and that the head restraint 
does not cause any discomfort.
If the head restraint has to be removed, 
ensure that it is stored or attached securely 
to prevent it from being thrown around the 
vehicle in the event of sharp braking.

Children at the front
The legislation on carrying a child on the 
front passenger seat is specific to each 
country. Refer to the legislation in force in 
your country.
Deactivate the passenger's airbag when a 
rearward facing child seat is installed on the 
front seat. Otherwise, the child would risk 
being seriously injured or killed if the airbag 
were to inflate.

Installing a booster cushion
The chest part of the seat belt must be 
positioned on the child's shoulder without 
touching the neck.
Ensure that the lap part of the seat belt 
passes correctly over the child's thighs.
CITROËN recommends the use of a booster 
seat which has a back, fitted with a seat belt 
guide at shoulder level.
As a safety precaution, do not leave:
- 
one or more children alone and 
unsupervised in a vehicle,
a child or an animal in a vehicle which 
is exposed to the sun, with the windows 
closed,
the keys within reach of children inside 
the vehicle.

- 

- 

To prevent accidental opening of the doors, 
use the Child lock.
Take care not to open the rear windows by 
more than one third.
To protect young children from the rays of 
the sun, fit side blinds on the rear windows.

Practical informationSnow chains

In wintry conditions, snow chains improve traction as well as the behaviour of the vehicle when 
braking.

The snow chains must be fitted only 
to the front wheels. They must never 
be fitted to "space-saver" type spare 
wheels.

Take account of the legislation in force 
in your country on the use of snow 
chains and the maximum running speed 
authorised.

It is strongly recommended that before 
you leave, you practise fitting the snow 
chains on a level and dry surface.

Advice on installation
F 

If you have to fit the chains during a 
journey, stop the vehicle on a flat surface 
on the side of the road.

F  Apply the parking brake and position any 

wheel chocks to prevent movement of 
your vehicle.

F  Fit the chains following the instructions 

provided by the manufacturer.

F  Move off gently and drive for a few 

moments, without exceeding 30 mph  
(50 km/h).

F  Stop your vehicle and check that the snow 

chains are correctly tightened.

Avoid driving with snow chains on roads 
that have been cleared of snow, to 
avoid damaging your vehicle's tyres and 
the road surface. If your vehicle is fitted 
with alloy wheels, check that no part of 
the chain or its fixings is in contact with 
the wheel rim.

Use only chains designed for fitment to the type 
of road wheels on your vehicle:

Original equipment 

tyre size

Maximum link size

215/70 R16

225/55 R18

12 mm

For more information on snow chains,

Practical informationTowing a trailer, a caravan, etc.

Your vehicle is primarily designed for 
transporting people and luggage, but it may 
also be used for towing a trailer.

We recommend the use of genuine 
CITROËN towbars and their harnesses 
that have been tested and approved 
from the design stage of your vehicle 
and that the fitting of the towbar is 
entrusted to a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
If the towbar is not fitted by a 
CITROËN dealer, it is imperative that 
it is fitted following the manufacturer's 
instructions.

Driving with a trailer subjects the towing vehicle 
to more significant stress and its driver must be 
particularly careful.
For more advice on driving when towing, refer 
to the corresponding section.
For more information on Petrol weights or 
Diesel weights and in particular the towed 
loads which apply to your vehicle, refer to the 
corresponding section.
Take care to comply with the gross train 
weights indicated on the registration certificate 
or in the technical data for your vehicle.

177

7Practical informationAdvice on driving when towing
Distribution of loads
F  Distribute the load in the trailer so that the 
heaviest items are as close as possible to 
the axle and the nose weight approaches 
the maximum permitted without 
exceeding it.

Cooling
Towing a trailer on a slope increases the 
temperature of the coolant.
As the fan is electrically controlled, its cooling 
capacity is not dependent on the engine speed.
F  To lower the engine speed, reduce your 

Air density decreases with altitude, 
thus reducing engine performance. Above 
1 000 metres, the maximum towing load must 
be reduced by 10 % of the GTW and so on for 
every 1 000 metres of altitude.
For more information on Petrol weights or 
Diesel weights and in particular the towed 
loads which apply to your vehicle, refer to the 
corresponding section.

speed.

The maximum towed load on a long slope 
depends on the gradient and the exterior 
temperature.
In all cases, pay attention to the coolant 
temperature.

Side wind
F  Take into account the increased sensitivity 

to side wind.

F 

If this message is displayed, stop your 
vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so.

If the message flashes slowly, wait for the 
engine to cool before topping up the level, if 
necessary.
If the message flashes rapidly, contact a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop 
without delay.

Braking
Towing a trailer increases the braking distance.
To limit heat build-up in the brakes, use of the 
engine brake is recommended.

Tyres
F  Check the tyre pressures of the towing 
vehicle and of the trailer, observing the 
recommended pressures.

Lighting
F  Check the lighting and signalling on the 

trailer and the adjustment of the vehicle's 
headlamps.

For more information on Headlamp 
adjustment, refer to the corresponding 
section.

The rear parking sensors will be 
deactivated automatically when a 
genuine CITROËN towbar is used.

Practical informationFitting roof bars

For reasons of safety and to avoid damaging the roof, it is essential to use transverse bars that are 
approved for your vehicle.
Vehicles fitted with longitudinal bars

The transverse roof bars are fitted to the longitudinal bars at the 8 fixing points masked by covers.
Using a small screwdriver, remove the 8 covers on the inner faces of the longitudinal bars.

Vehicles not fitted with longitudinal bars

Use accessories recommended by 
CITROËN and follow the accessory 
manufacturer's fitting instructions.
Maximum authorised weight on the roof 
bars, for a loading height not exceeding 
40 cm (except bicycle carriers): 80 kg.
If the height exceeds 40 cm, adapt the 
speed of the vehicle to the condition of 
the road, to avoid damaging the roof 
bars and the fixings on the roof.
Please refer to national legislation to 
comply with the regulations regarding 
the transportation of objects which are 
longer than the vehicle.

The transverse bars are fitted directly to the roof of the vehicle, at the 4 anchorage points masked 
by covers.
Slide the covers towards the front of the vehicle to remove them.
Retain the protective covers.
After removing the roof bars, the protective covers should be refitted:
F

Practical informationChecking levels

Check all of these levels regularly, in line with the manufacturer's service schedule. Top them up if necessary, unless otherwise indicated.
If a level drops significantly, have the corresponding system checked by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.

Take care when working under the bonnet, as certain areas of the engine may be extremely hot (risk of burns) and the cooling fan could start at 
any time (even with the ignition off).

Oil level

The check of the level is done with 
the dipstick, located under the 
bonnet. Refer to the description of 
your engine compartment for the 
position of the dipstick.

This check will only be correct if the vehicle is 
on level ground and the engine has been off for 
more than 30 minutes.
It is normal to top up the oil level between 
two services (or oil changes). CITROËN 
recommends that you check the level, and top 
up if necessary, every 3 000 miles (5 000 km).
After topping up the oil, the check when 
switching on the ignition with the oil level 
indicator in the instrument panel is not valid 
during the 30 minutes after topping up.

Engine oil change
Refer to the manufacturer's service schedule 
for details of the interval for this operation.
In order to maintain the reliability of the engine 
and emission control system, never use 
additives in the engine oil.

Oil specification
The oil must be the correct grade for your 
engine and conform to the manufacturer's 
recommendations.

Dipstick
There are two marks on the dipstick:

A = maximum
If the level is above this 
mark, contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified 
workshop.
B = minimum
Top up the level through the 
oil filler orifice, using the 
correct grade of oil for your 
engine. The level must never 
be below this mark.

183

7Practical informationBrake fluid level

The brake fluid level should be close 
to the "MAX" mark. If it is not, check 
the brake pad wear.

Changing the fluid
Refer to the manufacturer's service schedule 
for details of the interval for this operation.

Fluid specification
The brake fluid must conform to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.

Coolant level

The coolant level should be between 
the two marks.

vehicle must be parked on level ground with the 
engine cold.

The cooling fan may start after switching 
off the engine: take care with articles and 
clothing that might become caught by the 
fan blades.

When the engine is warm, the temperature of 
the coolant is regulated by the fan.
As the cooling system is pressurised when the 
engine is warm, wait at least one hour after 
switching off the engine before carrying out 
any work.
To avoid any risk of scalding, unscrew the cap 
by two turns to allow the pressure to drop. 
When the pressure has dropped, remove the 
cap and top up the level.

Fluid specification
The coolant must conform to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.

schedule for details of the interval for 
checking this component.

As soon as the traffic conditions permit, 
regenerate the filter by driving at a 
speed of at least 25 mph (40 km/h) for 
about 20 minutes (with the 1.6 litre HDi 
engine, the minimum speed is 37 mph 
(60 km/h)).
If the warning lamp stays on, this 
indicates a low additive level.
For more information on Checking 
levels and the Diesel additive level in 
particular, refer to the corresponding 
section.

On a new vehicle, the first particle 
filter regeneration operations may be 
accompanied by a "burning" smell, 
which is perfectly normal.
Following prolonged operation of the 
vehicle at very low speed or at idle, 
you may, in exceptional circumstances, 
notice the emission of water vapour at 
the exhaust on acceleration. This does 
not affect the behaviour of the vehicle 
or the environment.

7Practical informationBrake pads

Parking brake

If excessive travel or a loss of 
effectiveness of this system is 
noticed, the parking brake must be 
checked, even between two services.

Checking this system must be done by a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.

Brake wear depends on the style 
of driving, particularly in the case 
of vehicles used in town, over short 
distances. It may be necessary to have 
the condition of the brakes checked, 
even between vehicle services.

Unless there is a leak in the circuit, a drop in 
the brake fluid level indicates that the brake 
pads are worn.

Brake disc wear

For information on checking brake 
disc wear, contact a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop.

Only use products recommended by 
CITROËN or products of equivalent 
quality and specification.

In the event of a breakdownFitting the wheel

Fitting snow tyres
If you fit your vehicle with snow tyres 
fitted on steel rims, it is essential to use 
special bolts available from CITROËN 
dealers or a qualified workshop.

After changing a wheel
When using the "space-saving" spare 
wheel, do not exceed 50 mph (80 km/h).
Have the tightening of the bolts and the 
pressure of the spare wheel checked 
by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop without delay.
Have the punctured wheel repaired 
and refitted on the vehicle as soon as 
possible.

If the replacement of a tyre is 
necessary on 4-wheel drive versions, 
it is recommended that all four tyres be 
replaced at the same time, ensuring 
that the same make, model and size is 
used on all wheels.
This is because using tyres of different 
sizes, structure or rate of wear could 
damage transmission components.

List of operations

lenses with a protective coating:
F  do not clean them using a dry 

or abrasive cloth, nor with a 
detergent or solvent product,
F  use a sponge and soapy water,
F  when using a high pressure washer 

on persistent marks, do not keep 
the lance directed towards the 
lamps or their edges for too long, 
so as not to damage their protective 
coating and seals.

F  Do not touch the bulb directly with 

your fingers, use lint-free cloths.
Changing a bulb should only be done 
after the headlamp has been switched 
off for several minutes (risk of serious

9Technical dataPetrol weights and towed loads (kg)

The values for approved towed weights vary 
according to the sales zone (see the tables on 
the following pages).
The exact values are given in your vehicle's 
registration document as well as on the 
manufacturer's plate.
They are also mentioned in sales brochures.
For more details, contact a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop.

The kerb weight is equal to the unladen 
weight + driver (75 kg).

The weight of the braked trailer can be 
increased, within the GTW limit, if the 
GVW of the towing vehicle is reduced 
by an equal amount. Please note that 
towing using a lightly loaded towing 
vehicle may have an adverse effect 
on its road holding.

The GTW and towed load values indicated are 
valid up to a maximum altitude of 1 000 metres; 
the towed load mentioned must be reduced 
by 10 % for each additional 1 000 metres of 
altitude.
The speed of a towing vehicle must not exceed 
62 mph (100 km/h) (comply with the legislation 
in force in your country).
High exterior temperatures may result in a 
reduction in the performance of the vehicle to 
protect the engine; if the exterior temperature is 
above 37 °C, limit the towed load.

9Technical dataDiesel weights and towed loads (kg)

The values for approved towed weights vary 
according to the sales zone (see the tables on 
the following pages).
The exact values are given in your vehicle's 
registration document as well as on the 
manufacturer's plate.
They are also mentioned in sales brochures.
For more details, contact a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop.

The kerb weight is equal to the unladen 
weight + driver (75 kg).

The weight of the braked trailer can be 
increased, within the GTW limit, if the 
GVW of the towing vehicle is reduced 
by an equal amount. Please note that 
towing using a lightly loaded towing 
vehicle may have an adverse effect 
on its road holding.

The GTW and towed load values indicated are 
valid up to a maximum altitude of 1 000 metres; 
the towed load mentioned must be reduced 
by 10 % for each additional 1 000 metres of 
altitude.
The speed of a towing vehicle must not exceed 
62 mph (100 km/h) (comply with the legislation 
in force in your country).
High exterior temperatures may result in a 
reduction in the performance of the vehicle to 
protect the engine; if the exterior temperature is 
above 37 °C, limit the towed load.

NAVIGATION - GUIDANCE

04
GPS system

What is the navigation system and GPS?

The satellite navigation system guides the driver to the destination 
set in accordance with a chosen route.
Initially, it searches for the destination required by the user, then 
it calculates the route and finally it provides the visual and vocal 
guidance instructions.

GPS (Global Positioning System) consists of several 
satellites arranged around the earth. They continuously 
transmit digital signals which travel at the speed of 
light, on 2 different frequencies.
At any given time, the system receives its position 
in relation to the satellites detected and the time of 
transmission of the signal.
This enables the telematic unit to calculate its position 
and therefore that of the vehicle.
A repositioning process using the map database stored 
on the hard disk allows the vehicle to be positioned 
on the road network, so improving the accuracy of the 
vehicle location function.

What precautions should be observed in order to make 
best use of the system?

Do not place anything on or near the GPS aerial.
Do not use any digital communication equipment (personal 
computers, etc.) near the GPS aerial.
Do not affix any reflective films or films containing carbon to the 
windows.

262

in a tunnel or underground car park,
underneath a two-level motorway,
in an area with several very high buildings,
surrounded by closely planted trees.

The system's measurements may be inaccurate if the vehicle is:
- 
- 
- 
- 
Depending on the vehicle's situation and the reception of the GPS 
information, the displayed information may disappear from the 
screen temporarily.

What is a point of interest (POI)?

A point of interest (POI) is represented by an icon on 
the map, it represents an airport, a station, a town 
hall, ...

Up to 40 different icons may be displayed (refer to the 
section "Points of interest icon").
They are classified in 5 groups and identified by one 
colour for each group:
-  Shops, finance and businesses (Green),
-  Vehicles and travel (Dark blue),
-  Restaurants (Orange),
-  Public places and emergency services (Brown),
-  Entertainment and attractions (Blue).

RADIO
RDS, AF, TP, PTY

What is RDS?

The Radio Data System (RDS) function on the FM waveband permits:
- 

automatic retuning to alternative frequencies carrying the same station 
while travelling through different regions (if the transmitters of this 
station cover the area through which you are travelling),
temporary tuning to traffic information announcements,
display of the name of the station, etc...

- 
- 
Most FM stations use RDS.
These stations transmit non-audible data in addition to their programmes.
The data transmitted in this way allows you access to various functions, 
mainly displaying of the name of the station, temporary tuning to 
traffic information announcements or automatic retuning to alternative 
frequencies.
RDS allows you to continue listening to the same station automatically by 
means of alternative frequencies. However, alternative frequencies may not 
be provided throughout the country. Radio stations do not cover the whole 
country, which explains the loss of reception of the station during a journey.

RDS alternative frequencies

Your radio automatically checks and selects the best frequency for the radio station 
to which it is tuned (if the station broadcasts on several transmitters or frequencies).
The frequency of a radio station covers approximately 30 miles (50 km). The 
change from one frequency to another explains the loss of reception during a 
journey.
If the station to which you are listening does not have several frequencies in the 
region in which you are currently located, you can deactivate automatic alternative 
frequencies.

272

Traffic information function

The Traffic Programme (TP) function permits automatic and 
temporary switching to an FM station broadcasting traffic 
information.
The radio station or the source that you are listening to at this point 
is placed on hold.
Once the traffic information has ended, the system switches back to 
the radio station or the source that you were listening to initially.

Programme types

Some stations offer the option of listening to a themed type of 
programme as a priority, selected from the list available below:
NEWS, AFFAIRS, INFOS, SPORT, EDUCATE, DRAMA, CUlTURE, 
SCIENCE, VARIED, POP M, ROCK M, EASY M, lIGHT M, 
ClASSICS, OTHER M, WEATHER, FINANCE, CHIlDREN, 
SOCIAL, RELIGION, PHONE IN, TRAVEL, LEISURE, JAZZ, 
COUNTRY, NATION M, OLDIES, FOLK M, DOCUMENT.

General notes on files

Playing an MP3/WMA CD

Windows Media and Microsoft Corporation are trademarks 
registered in the United States and/or other countries.

When the MP3/WMA CD is inserted in the player, 
playing of the tracks is automatic.
The tracks cannot be recorded onto the music server. 

File handling

You can play CDs with up to 8 levels, 100 folders and 255 files 
maximum.

MP3 and WMA audio file formats

MP3 is the abbreviation of MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 and MPEG is 
the abbreviation of Motion Pictures Experts Group. This is a digital 
audio compression standard that reduces the size of audio files by 
eliminating frequencies that are inaudible to the human ear.
This compression divides the size of the content of a conventional 
audio CD by approximately 10, which means that the content of  
10 audio CDs can be recorded onto a single CD-R or CD-RW.
WMA is the abbreviation of Windows Media Audio, another audio 
data compression standard offered by Microsoft.
It can be used to create and save audio files at a compression rate 
lower than that of the MP3 format, with an equivalent file size.

Some blank CDs may not be played by your equipment (quality, 
recording speed...).
When you burn a CD-R or CD-RW, select the ISO 9660 level 1.2  
or Joliet burning standard.
To obtain the best acoustic quality possible, select the lowest 
burning speed.
The MPEG1 and MPEG2 standards are accepted.
Transmission speeds between 32 and 320 kbits/s and scans 
between 16 kHz and 48 kHz are accepted.
To display the title information (the name of the artist, the title of the 
album, etc...), the information contained in the ID3 Tags or the WMA 
Tags must be included in the MP3/WMA files burned onto the disc.

Your audio system may allow you to listen to music which is usually

RDS

Regional mode

The Radio Data System (RDS) function on the FM waveband permits:
- 

automatic retuning to alternative frequencies carrying the same 
station while travelling through different regions (if the transmitters 
of this station cover the area through which you are travelling),
temporary tuning to traffic information announcements,
display of the name of the station, etc...

- 
- 
Most FM stations use RDS.
These stations transmit non-audible data in addition to their 
programmes.
The data transmitted in this way allows you access to various 
functions, mainly displaying of the name of the station, temporary 
tuning to traffic information announcements or automatic retuning to 
alternative frequencies.
RDS allows you to continue listening to the same station automatically 
by means of alternative frequencies. However, alternative frequencies 
may not be provided throughout the country. Radio stations do not 
cover the whole country, which explains the loss of reception of the 
station during a journey.

RDS alternative frequencies

Your radio automatically checks and selects the best frequency for 
the radio station to which it is tuned (if the station broadcasts on 
several transmitters or frequencies).
The frequency of a radio station covers approximately 30 miles 
(50 km). The change from one frequency to another explains the 
loss of reception during a journey.
If the station to which you are listening does not have several 
frequencies in the region in which you are currently located, you can 
deactivate automatic alternative frequencies.

Some stations are organised in a network.
In different regions, they broadcast different or shared programmes 
depending on the time of day.
You can follow:
- 
- 

a regional station only,
the entire network, with the possibility that you will be listening 
to a different programme.

Traffic information function

The Traffic Programme (TP) function permits automatic and 
temporary switching to an FM station broadcasting traffic 
information.
The radio station or the source that you are listening to at this point 
is paused.
Once the traffic information has ended, the system switches back to 
the radio station or the source that you were listening to initially.

Programme types

Some stations offer the option of listening to a themed type of 
programme as a priority, selected from the list available below:
NEWS, AFFAIRS, INFOS, SPORT, EDUCATE, DRAMA, CUlTURE, 
SCIENCE, VARIED, POP M, ROCK M, EASY M, lIGHT M,

RDS allows you to continue listening to the same station by means

"AF" alternative frequencies

Your radio automatically checks and selects the best frequency for 
the radio station to which it is tuned (if the station broadcasts on 
several transmitters or frequencies).
The frequency of a radio station covers approximately 30 miles 
(50 km). The change from one frequency to another explains the 
temporary loss of reception during a journey.
If the station to which you are listening does not have several

On long distance journeys, when the stored station becomes 
weak, the radio searches first for another frequency for the

broadcasting the regional programme (REG). If this also fails, the 
radio returns to the stored station.
