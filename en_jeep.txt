WHY CHOOSING 

GENUINE SPARE PARTS

We really know the vehicle because we invented, designed and produced it: 

we know every minor detail of it. At the Jeep authorised workshops you will find technicians 
directly trained by us, providing quality and professionalism needed for all service operations.

Jeep workshops are always close to you for the regular servicing operations, 

season checks and practical recommendations by our experts. 

With genuine parts your new vehicle will maintain long-term reliability, 

comfort and  performance: this is why you bought it.

We recommend to always ask for genuine spare parts for the components used on our vehicles, 

because they originate from our steady commitment in research and development 

of highly innovative technologies. 

For these reasons it is advisable to use genuine spare parts, 

because they are the ones specifically designed for your vehicle.

Dear Customer,
We would like to congratulate and thank you for choosing a Jeep.
We have written this handbook to help you get to know all the features of your vehicle and use it in the best possible way. This vehicle
is intended for daily use as well as for specific uses, so even routes and uses not suitable for traditional vehicles on the market can
be tackled. Ride and handling capabilities are different from most other vehicles, both on and off road; we thus recommend you to
spend all the time necessary to know the vehicle dynamics.
Here you will find information, advice and important warnings regarding use of your vehicle and how to achieve the best performance
from the technical features of your Jeep.
You are advised to read it right through before taking to the road for the first time, to become familiar with the controls and above all
with those concerning brakes, steering and gearbox; at the same time, you can understand the vehicle behaviour on different road
surfaces.
This document also provides a description of special features and tips, as well as essential information for the safe driving, care and
maintenance of your Jeep over time.
After reading it, you are advised to keep the handbook inside the vehicle, for an easy reference and for making sure it remains onboard
the vehicle should it be sold.
In the attached Warranty Booklet you will also find a description of the Services that Jeep offers to its customers, the Warranty
Certificate and the detail of the terms and conditions for maintaining its validity.
We are sure that these will help you to get in touch with and appreciate your new vehicle and the service provided by the people at
Jeep.
Enjoy reading. Happy motoring!

versions are not explicitly indicated in the text: as a consequence, you should only consider the information which is
related to the trim level, engine and version that you have purchased. Any content introduced throughout the production
of the model, outside the specific request of options at the time of purchase, will be identified with the wording (where
provided).
All data contained in this publication are intended to help you use your vehicle in the best possible way. Chrysler Group
LLC effort aims at a constant improvement of the vehicles produced. For this reason it reserves the right to make

READ THIS CAREFULLY
REFUELLING

Petrol engines: only refuel with unleaded petrol with octane rating (RON) not less than 95 in compliance with the European specification
EN228. Do not use petrol containing methanol or ethanol E85. Using these mixtures may cause misfiring and driving issues, as well as
damage fundamental components of the supply system.
Diesel engines: refuel only with diesel fuel conforming to the European specification EN590. The use of other products or mixtures may
damage the engine beyond repair and consequently invalidate the warranty, due to the damage caused.
For further details on the use of the correct fuel see paragraph "Refuelling the vehicle" in the "Starting and driving" chapter.

STARTING THE ENGINE

Versions with manual gearbox (petrol engines): make sure that the parking brake is engaged; set the gear lever to neutral, fully depress
the clutch pedal without pressing the accelerator, then bring the ignition device to AVV or press the ignition device button and release the
key or the button as soon as the engine has started.
Versions with manual gearbox (diesel engines): make sure that the parking brake is engaged; set the gear lever to neutral, fully depress
the clutch pedal without pressing the accelerator, then bring the ignition device to MAR and wait for warning lights
to switch
off. Bring the ignition device to AVV or press the ignition device button and finally release the key or the button as soon as the engine has
started.
Versions with automatic transmission: make sure that the parking brake is engaged and that the gear lever is in P (Park) or N (Neutral),
fully depress the brake pedal, then bring the ignition device to AVV or press the ignition device button.

and

PARKING ON FLAMMABLE MATERIAL

The catalytic converter develops high temperatures during operation. Do not park the vehicle on grass, dry leaves, pine needles or other
flammable material: fire hazard.

RESPECTING THE ENVIRONMENT

The vehicle is fitted with a system that carries out a continuous diagnosis of the emission-related components in order to help protect the
environment.

ELECTRICAL ACCESSORIES

If, after buying the vehicle, you decide to add electrical accessories (with the risk of gradually draining the battery), contact a Jeep Dealership.
They can calculate the overall electrical requirement and check that the vehicle's electric system can support the required load.

SCHEDULED SERVICING

Correct maintenance of the vehicle is essential for ensuring that it maintains its performance and its safety features, its environmental
friendliness and low running costs unchanged in time.

SYMBOLS
Some vehicle components have coloured labels whose symbols indicate precautions to be observed when using this
component.
A plate summarising these symbols can also be found under the bonnet.

ROLL OVER WARNING
The risk of rolling over for off-road vehicles is remarkably higher than for any other type of vehicle. This vehicle has a higher
ground clearance and has a higher centre of gravity compared to many other vehicles for transporting passengers, so that it
allows a better performance to be reached in a wide range of off-road applications.
Anyway, a dangerous driving style can increase the risk of losing control of the vehicle.
The vehicle is more subject to the risk of rolling over because of the higher centre of gravity should the driver lose its control.
Therefore, avoid tight curves or other unsafe driving conditions that may lead to losing the vehicle control. Failure to comply
with these precautions may cause accidents, vehicle rolling over and severe or fatal injuries. Drive carefully.
The main cause for severe or fatal injuries is failing to wear driver and passenger seat belts. In the event of rolling over, a
passenger not wearing the seat belt is much more likely to be fatally injured than a passenger wearing it correctly. Always fasten
the seat belts.

VEHICLE CHANGES/ALTERATIONS

IMPORTANT Any change or alteration of the vehicle might seriously affect its safety and road holding, thus causing accidents,
in which the occupants could even be fatally injured.

USE OF THE OWNER HANDBOOK
OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
Each time direction instructions (left/right or forwards/backwards) about the vehicle are given, these must be intended as
regarding an occupant in the driver's seat. Special cases not complying with this rule will be properly specified in the text.
The figures in the Owner Handbook are provided by way of example only: this might imply that some details of the image do
not correspond to the actual arrangement of your vehicle. In addition, the Handbook has been conceived considering vehicles
with steering wheel on the left side; it is therefore possible that on vehicles with steering wheel on the right side, some controls
position or construction is not exactly mirror-like with respect to the figure.
To identify the chapter with the information needed you can consult the index at the end of this Owner Handbook.
Chapters can be rapidly identified with dedicated graphic tabs, at the side of each odd page. A few pages further there is a key
for getting to know the chapter order and the relevant symbols in the tabs. There is anyway a textual indication of the current
chapter at the side of each even page.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
While reading this Owner Handbook you will find a series of WARNINGS to prevent procedures that could damage your
vehicle.
There are also PRECAUTIONS that must be carefully followed to prevent incorrect use of the components of the vehicle,
which could cause accidents or injuries.
Therefore all WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS must always be carefully followed.
WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS are recalled in the text with the following symbols:

personal safety;

vehicle safety;

environmental protection.

NOTE These symbols, when necessary, are indicated besides the title or at the end of the line and are followed by a number.
That number recalls the corresponding warning at the end of the relevant section.

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR CAR

In-depth knowledge of your new vehicle
starts here.
The booklet that you are reading simply
and directly explains how it is made
and how it works.
That’s why we advise you to read it
seated comfortably on board, so that
you can see immediately what is
described here for yourself.

checked over by a Jeep Dealership before
driving again.
3) Always take the key with you when you
leave your vehicle to prevent someone
from accidentally operating the controls.
Remember to engage the electric parking
brake. Never leave children unattended
in the vehicle.
4) It is absolutely forbidden to carry out any
after-market operation involving steering

even start the vehicle.

SENTRY KEY®
The Sentry Key® system, prevents
unauthorised use of the vehicle, disa-
bling engine starting.
The system does not need to be
enabled/activated: operation is
automatic, regardless of the fact that
the vehicle's doors are locked or
unlocked.
When the ignition device is taken to
MAR, the Sentry Key® system identi-
fies the code transmitted by the key. If
the code is recognised as valid, the
Sentry Key® system enables engine
starting.
When the ignition device is brought
back to STOP, the Sentry Key® sys-
tem deactivates the control unit control-
ling the engine, thus preventing its
starting.
For the correct engine starting
procedures, see the instructions in the
"Starting the engine" paragraph,
"Starting and driving" chapter.

IRREGULAR OPERATION
If, during starting, the key code is not
correctly recognised, the
icon is
displayed on the instrument panel (see
the instructions in the "Warning lights
and messages" paragraph, "Knowing
the instrument panel" chapter). This
condition leads to the engine switching
off after 2 seconds. In this case, bring
the ignition device to STOP and then to
MAR; if it is still blocked, try with the
other keys provided. If it is still not
possible to start the engine, contact a
Jeep Dealership.

WARNING

4) The fabric upholstery for the seats has
been designed to withstand long-term
wear deriving from normal use of the
vehicle. Nevertheless, some precautions
are required. Avoid prolonged and/or
excessive rubbing involving clothing
accessories such as metal buckles,
bosses, Velcro strips and the like, which,
by applying a high pressure on the fabric in
a limited area, could cause it to break,
thereby damaging the upholstery.
5) Do not arrange objects beneath the
electrically adjustable seat and do not
impede its movement, since the controls

corresponding button. If a button
whose function is already active is
pressed, its operation is cancelled and
the corresponding LED switches off.
To restore automatic control of the
air distribution after a manual selection,
press the AUTO button.

NOTES

The automatic climate control manages
the Stop/Start system (engine off and
vehicle at a standstill) in order to
guarantee sufficient comfort inside the
vehicle. In particularly severe climate
conditions it is recommended to limit
the use of the Stop/Start system to
prevent the compressor from
continuously switching on and off, with
consequent rapid misting of the
windows and accumulation of humidity
with unpleasant smells in the passenger
compartment.

When the Stop/Start system is on
(engine off and vehicle at a standstill),
the automatic recirculation
management is turned off always taking
air in from outside, to reduce the
probability of the windows misting up
(as the compressor is off).

WARNING LIGHTS AND MESSAGES
IMPORTANT The warning light switches on in the instrument panel together with a dedicated message and/or acoustic signal
when applicable. These indications are indicative and precautionary and as such must not be considered as exhaustive and/or
alternative to the information contained in the Owner Handbook, which you are advised to read carefully in all cases. Always
refer to the information in this chapter in the event of a failure indication.
IMPORTANT Failure indications displayed are divided into two categories: serious and less serious failures. Serious faults are
indicated by a repeated and prolonged warning "cycle". Less serious faults are indicated by a warning "cycle" with a shorter
duration. The display cycle of both categories can be interrupted. The instrument panel warning light will stay on until the cause
of the failure is eliminated.

If the symbol flashes, this does not mean that there is a fault on the vehicle, rather it simply reports that it is
now necessary to change the oil as a result of regular use of the vehicle.
The deterioration of engine oil is accelerated by using the vehicle for short drives, preventing the engine
from reaching operating temperature.
Contact a Jeep Dealership as soon as possible.

20) 21)

WARNING

20) Deteriorated engine oil should be replaced as soon as possible after the symbol is switched on, and never more than 500 km after it first
switches on. Failure to observe the above indications may result in severe damage to the engine and invalidate the warranty. The switching
on of this symbol is not correlated to the quantity of oil in the engine, therefore if it flashes you do not need to top up the engine oil.
21) If the symbol flashes whilst driving, contact a Jeep Dealership.

DPF CLEANING (particulate trap) in progress (diesel versions with DPF only)
The symbol switches on constantly to indicate that the DPF system needs to eliminate the trapped
pollutants (particulate) through the regeneration process.
The symbol does not switch on during every DPF regeneration, but only when driving conditions require
that the driver is notified. To turn off the symbol, keep the vehicle in motion until the regeneration process is
over. On average, the process lasts 15 minutes. Optimal conditions for completing the process are
achieved by travelling at 60 km/h with engine speed above 2000 rpm.
When this symbol switches on, it does not indicate a vehicle failure and thus it should not be taken to a
workshop. On some versions, together with the symbol switching on, the display shows a dedicated
message.

22)

WARNING

22) Vehicle travel speed should always be adapted to the traffic and weather conditions, and must always comply with traffic regulations. The
engine can be stopped even if the DPF warning light is on: however, repeated interruptions of the regeneration process could cause
premature deterioration of the engine oil. For this reason it is always advisable to wait for the symbol to go off before turning off the engine,
following the instructions above. It is not advisable to complete DPF regeneration with the vehicle stationary.

ACTIVE SAFETY
SYSTEMS
ABS (Anti-lock Braking
System)
This system, which is an integral part of
the braking system, prevents one or
more wheels from locking and slipping
in all road surface conditions,
irrespective of the intensity of the
braking action, ensuring that the vehicle
can be controlled even during
emergency braking and optimising
stopping distances.

System intervention
The driver can feel that the ABS system
has come into action because the
brake pedal pulsates slightly and the
system gets noisier: this is entirely
normal with the system operating.

31) 32) 33) 34) 35) 36) 37)

DTC (Drag Torque
Control) SYSTEM
The system intervenes in the event of
sudden downshifting, or during ABS
braking, restoring torque to the engine
and thus preventing excessive drag
at the drive wheels, which may lead the
wheels to lock and a loss of vehicle
stability, above all in low-grip
conditions.

ESC (Electronic Stability
Control) SYSTEM
The ESC system improves the
directional control and stability of the
vehicle in various driving conditions,
correcting understeer and oversteer,
distributing the brake force on the
appropriate wheels.

System intervention
The intervention of the system is
indicated by the flashing of the

warning light on the instrument

panel, to inform the driver that
the vehicle is in critical stability and grip
conditions.

38) 39) 40) 41) 42)

TC (Traction Control)
SYSTEM
The system automatically operates in
the event of slipping, loss of grip on wet
roads (aquaplaning) and acceleration
on slippery, snowy or icy roads, etc. on
one or both drive wheels.

System intervention
The intervention of the system is
indicated by the flashing of the

warning light on the instrument

panel, to inform the driver that
the vehicle is in critical stability and grip
conditions.

PBA (Panic Brake
Assist) SYSTEM
The PBA system is designed to
improve the vehicle’s braking capacity
during emergency braking.
The brake pedal should be pressed
continuously during braking, avoiding
intermittent presses, to get the most
out of the system. Do not reduce
pressure on the brake pedal until
braking is not necessary anymore.
The PBA system is deactivated when
the brake pedal is released.

48) 49) 50)

HSA (Hill Start Assist)
SYSTEM
This system is an integral part of the
ESC system and facilitates starting on
slopes.

System deactivation
The Hill Start Assist system can be
deactivated using the display Menu
(see the instructions in the "Display"
paragraph, "Knowing the instrument
panel" chapter).

51) 52)

DST SYSTEM (Dynamic
Steering Torque)
The DST function uses the integration
of the ESC system with the electric
power steering to increase the safety
level of the whole vehicle.

53)

ERM (Electronic Rollover
Mitigation) SYSTEM
The system monitors the tendency of
the wheels to rise from the ground if the
driver performs extreme manoeuvres
like quick steering to avoid an obstacle,
especially in poor road conditions.
If these conditions occur, the system
intervenes on the brakes and engine
power to reduce the possibility that the
wheels are raised from the ground. It
is not possible to avoid tendency to roll
over if the phenomenon is due to
reasons such as driving on high side
gradients, collision with objects or other
vehicles.

54)

TSC (Trailer Sway
Control) SYSTEM
The system employs a series of
sensors located on the vehicle to
identify excessive swerving of the trailer
and take the necessary precautions
to eliminate it.

System intervention
When the system is active, the
warning light flashes on the

instrument panel, the engine power is
reduced and braking can be felt on the
individual wheels, following the attempt
to eliminate the swerving of the trailer.
The system is active only with ESC
engaged.
When the ESC system is deactivated
(by pressing the button on the central
tunnel), the TSC system is deactivated
as well.
55) 56)

HDC (Hill Descent
Control) SYSTEM
(where provided)
It is an integral part of the ESC system
and is aimed at keeping the vehicle at a
constant speed during a descent,
operating autonomously on the brakes
in various ways at the same time.
In this way the vehicle stability and
completely safe driving are guaranteed,
above all in poor grip conditions and
steep descents.

Enabling the system
To enable the system, press the button
fig. 53:
The system is enabled if the following
conditions are met:

53

J0A0154C

❒ the Selec-Terrain™ device is in
4WD LOW mode;
❒ the vehicle speed is below 25 km/h;
❒ the electric parking brake (EPB) is
deactivated;
❒ the driver side door is closed.

Activation of the system
Once enabled, the HDC system will
activate automatically if the vehicle
is driven downhill on a steep slope,
higher than 8%.
The speed set for the HDC system can
be adjusted using the brake pedal
and the accelerator pedal (in the
1–25 km/h range). Once the desired
speed is reached, when both pedals
are released the HDC system will
maintain the set speed.
In this way, the driver can adjust the
speed and, if necessary, reassume
control of the vehicle.

65

With gear lever in neutral, speed
adjustment using the accelerator pedal
is not available.
The driver can cancel the intervention of
the HDC system at any time by
completely depressing the accelerator
pedal or the brake pedal.

System deactivation
The HDC system is deactivated, but
remains available, if one of the following
conditions is met:
❒ the speed of the vehicle exceeds
25 km/h but remains below 40 km/h;
❒ the vehicle is on a descent with
insufficient gradient, below 8%, or a
level surface, or is going uphill;
❒ the gear lever is in P (Park) position.

Disabling the system
The system is deactivated and disabled
if one of the following conditions is
met:
❒ button press fig. 53;
❒ activation of mode other than 4WD
LOW;
❒ electric parking brake (EPB)
engagement;
❒ driver side door open;
❒ speed of 40 km/h exceeded
(immediate exit from HDC function).

57) 58)

DISABLING ACTIVE
SAFETY SYSTEMS
Depending on the versions, there are 3
configurations for the active safety
systems on the vehicle:
❒ systems enabled;
❒ systems partially disabled;
❒ systems disabled.

Systems enabled
All active safety systems are enabled.
This is the normal operating mode
when driving a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
This mode should be used in most
driving conditions. The system will be in
"Systems enabled" mode every time
the engine is started.
IMPORTANT You are advised to select
"Systems partially disabled" or
"Systems disabled" modes only for
specific driving requirements.

Systems partially disabled
By pressing the
button on the central
tunnel fig. 54 for fewer than 5 seconds
when driving, the TSC system can
be disabled and the intervention of the
TC system can be limited to braking
action on the individual drive wheels.
The other systems remain enabled.

Activation of this mode is indicated by
the warning light on the instrument
panel switching on (on some versions,
together with a message on the
display).

54

J0A0282C

To restore "All systems enabled"
operating mode, press the button on
the central tunnel again.
"Systems completely enabled" mode
will automatically reactivate every time
the engine is started.
IMPORTANT When travelling on snowy
roads with snow chains, it may be
helpful to activate "Systems partially
disabled" mode: in these conditions,
slipping of the drive wheels when
moving off makes it possible to obtain
better traction.

button on the central

Systems disabled
Pressing the
tunnel for more than 5 seconds
completely deactivates the ESC
system, as well as the TSC and ERM
systems; the TC system will be limited
to braking action on the individual
drive wheels. The other systems remain
enabled.
Activation of this mode is highlighted by
the warning light on the instrument
panel switching on (on some versions,
together with a message on the
display).
IMPORTANT If a speed of
approximately 65 km/h (40 mph) is
exceeded, the systems will behave as
described for "Systems partially
disabled" mode.
To restore "Systems enabled" operating
mode, press the button on the central
tunnel again.
"Systems enabled" mode will
automatically reactivate every time the
engine is started.

Versions with Selec-Terrain™
device
On versions with Selec-Terrain™
device, the activation of certain driving
modes partially or totally deactivates
certain active safety systems in order to
optimise performance in the specific
mode.

When active safety systems are partially
or totally deactivated, the warning
light will turn on in the instrument panel.
In "SAND" and "MUD" modes, the
active safety systems are partially
disabled and fine-tuned to ensure
maximum performance in the specific
operating modes. It is in any case
possible to reactivate them completely
at any time by pressing the
button on
the central tunnel should you wish to
favour safety over "off-road"
performance.
IMPORTANT In 4WD LOW modes, the
active safety systems are completely
disabled in order to ensure maximum
off-road driving performance and it will
not be possible to reactivate them.

59) 60) 61) 62)

WARNING

31) When the ABS intervenes and you feel
the brake pedal pulsating, do not reduce
the pressure, but hold it down firmly and
confidently; in doing so you will brake
in the shortest distance possible,
depending on the current road conditions.
32) For maximum efficiency of the braking
system, a bedding-in period of about
500 km is required: during this period it is
advisable to avoid sharp, repeated and
prolonged braking.

33) If the ABS intervenes, this indicates
that the grip of the tyres on the road is
nearing its limit: you must slow down to a
speed compatible with the available grip.
34) The ABS can’t overrule the natural laws
of physics, and can’t increase the grip
available according to the condition of the
road.
35) The ABS cannot prevent accidents,
including those due to excessive speed on
corners, driving on low-grip surfaces or
aquaplaning.
36) The capability of the ABS must never
be tested irresponsibly and dangerously, in
such a way as to compromise personal
safety and the safety of others.
37) For the correct operation of the ABS,
the tyres must of necessity be the same
make and type on all wheels, in perfect
condition and, above all, of the prescribed
type and size.
38) The ESC system cannot alter the
natural laws of physics, and cannot
increase grip, which depends on the
condition of the road.
39) The ESC system cannot prevent
accidents, including those due to excessive
speed on corners, driving on low-grip
surfaces or aquaplaning.
40) The capability of the ESC system must
never be tested irresponsibly and
dangerously, in such a way as to
compromise personal safety and the safety
of others.
41) For the correct operation of the ESC
system, the tyres must of necessity be the
same make and type on all wheels, in
perfect condition and, above all, of the
prescribed type and size.

67

42) ESC performance features must not
induce the driver to take unnecessary
or unfounded risks. Your driving style must
always be suited to the road conditions,
visibility and traffic. The driver is, in any
case, responsible for safe driving.
43) For the correct operation of the TC
system, the tyres must of necessity be the
same make and type on all wheels, in
perfect condition and, above all, of the
prescribed type and size.
44) TC performance features must not
induce the driver to take unnecessary or
unfounded risks. Your driving style must
always be suited to the road conditions,
visibility and traffic. The driver is, in any
case, responsible for safe driving.
45) The TC system can’t overrule the
natural laws of physics, and can’t increase
the grip available according to the
condition of the road.
46) The TC system cannot prevent
accidents, including those due to excessive
speed on corners, driving on low-grip
surfaces or aquaplaning.
47) The capability of the TC must never be
tested irresponsibly and dangerously, in
such a way as to compromise personal
safety and the safety of others.
48) The PBA system can’t overrule the
natural laws of physics, and can’t increase
the grip available according to the
condition of the road.
49) The PBA system cannot prevent
accidents, including those due to excessive
speed on corners, driving on low-grip
surfaces or aquaplaning.

50) The capability of the PBA system must
never be tested irresponsibly and
dangerously, in such a way as to
compromise the safety of the driver, the
other occupants of the vehicle or any other
road user.
51) The Hill Start Assist system is not a
parking brake; therefore, never leave the
vehicle without having engaged the electric
parking brake, turned the engine off and
engaged first gear, so that it is parked
in safe conditions (for further information
read the "Parking" paragraph in the
"Starting and driving" chapter).
52) There may be situations on small
gradients (less than 8%), with vehicle
laden, in which the Hill Start Assist system
may not activate, causing a slight reversing
motion and increasing the risk of collision
with another vehicle or object. The driver is,
in any case, responsible for safe driving.
53) DST is an aid for driving and does not
relieve the driver of responsibility for driving
the vehicle.
54) The performance of a vehicle with ERM
must never be tested in imprudent or
dangerous ways, with the possibility of
putting the safety of the driver or other
people at risk.
55) When towing trailers, the utmost
caution at the wheel is advised. Never
exceed the maximum permitted loads (see
the description in the "Weights" paragraph
in the "Technical Specifications" chapter).

56) The TSC system cannot prevent
swerving for all trailers. If the system
activates during driving, reduce the speed,
stop the vehicle in a safe place and arrange
the load correctly to prevent the trailer
from swerving.
57) Prolonged use of the system may
overheat the braking system. If the brakes
overheat, the HDC system, when active,
will be gradually deactivated after suitably
informing the driver (LED on button off):
it can be reactivated only when the brakes
have cooled sufficiently. The distance
that can be covered depends on the
temperature of the brakes and therefore on
the gradient, load and speed of the
vehicle.
58) The performance of a vehicle with HDC
must never be tested in imprudent or
dangerous ways, with the possibility of
putting the safety of the driver or other
people at risk.
59) When "Systems partially disabled"
mode is selected, the intervention of the
TC function is limited to braking action on
the individual drive wheels and the
warning lights switches on in the

instrument panel. In "systems partially
disabled" mode, the engine torque value
that the ESC system may require will
not be guaranteed and the stability of the
vehicle will therefore be reduced.
60) With "Systems partially disabled" mode
selected, the TSC (Trailer Sway Control)
system is disabled.
61) Your driving style must always be
suited to the road conditions, visibility and
traffic. The driver is, in any case,
responsible for safe driving.

manoeuvres. "Systems disabled" mode is
only for off-road use.

AUXILIARY DRIVING
SYSTEMS
BSM (Blind Spot
Monitoring) SYSTEM
(where provided)
The system uses two radar sensors,
located in the rear bumper (one for
each side - see fig. 55), to detect the
presence of vehicles (vehicles, trucks,
motorbikes, etc.) in the rear side blind
spots of your vehicle.

55

J0A0220C

The system warns the driver about the
presence of vehicles in the detection
area by lighting up, on the relevant side,
the warning light located on the door
mirror fig. 56, along with an acoustic
warning. When the vehicle is started the
warning light turns on to signal the
driver that the system is active.

56

J0A0217C

Sensors
The sensors are activated engaging any
forward gear at a speed higher than
about 10 km/h, or engaging the reverse
gear.
The sensors are temporarily
deactivated with vehicle at a standstill
and the gear lever in position P (Park)
(versions with automatic transmission),
or with vehicle at a standstill and
electric parking brake engaged
(versions with manual gearbox).

69

The rear bumper area where the radar
sensors are located must stay free from
snow, ice and dirt gathered from the
road surface for the system to operate
correctly.
Do not cover the rear bumper area
where the radar sensors are located
with any object (e.g. adhesives, bike
rack, etc.).
Rear view: the system detects vehicles
approaching to the rear part of your
vehicle on both sides and entering the
rear detection area with a speed delta
lower than 50 km/h with respect to your
vehicle.
Overtaking vehicles: if another vehicle
is overtaken slowly (with a speed delta
lower than about 25 km/h) and this
stays in the blind spot for about 1.5
seconds, the warning light on the door
mirror of the corresponding side lights
up. If the speed delta between the
two vehicles is higher than about 25
km/h, the warning light does not light
up.

RCP (Rear Cross Path
detection) system
This system helps the driver during
reverse manoeuvres in the case of
reduced visibility. During "RCP"
operating mode, the system emits
acoustic and visual warnings if
the presence of an object is detected.
When an acoustic warning is sent,
the Uconnect™ volume is lowered.
The system can be activated/
deactivated through the display Menu
or the Uconnect™ system.
The system monitors the rear detection
areas on both sides of the vehicle, to
detect objects moving towards the
sides of the vehicle at a minimum
speed comprised between about 1
km/h and 3 km/h and objects moving
at a maximum speed of 35 km/h, as
generally happens in the parking areas.
The system activation is signalled to
the driver by means of a visual and
acoustic warning.

IMPORTANT If the sensors are covered
by objects or vehicles, the system will
not warn the driver.

The detection area of the system
covers about a lane on both sides of
the vehicle (around 3 metres). This area
begins from the door mirror and
extends for about 6 metres towards the
rear part of the vehicle.
When the sensors are active the system
monitors the detection areas on both
sides of the vehicle and warns the
driver about the possible presence of
vehicles in these areas.
While driving the system monitors the
detection area from three different input
points (side, rear and front) to check
whether a signal needs to be sent
to the driver. The system can detect the
presence of a vehicle in one of these
three areas.

Important

The system does not signal the
presence of fixed object (e.g. safety
barriers, poles, walls, etc.). However, in
some circumstances, the system may
activate in the presence of these
objects. This is normal and does not
indicate a system malfunction.
The system does not warn the driver
about the presence of vehicles coming
from the opposite direction, in the
adjacent lanes.
If a trailer is hitched to the vehicle, the
system automatically deactivates.

In the event of an imminent collision the
system intervenes by automatically
braking the vehicle to prevent the crash
or reduce its effects.

The system may lightly brake to warn
the driver if a possible frontal accident
is detected. Signals and limited braking
are intended to allow the driver to
react promptly, in order to prevent or
reduce the effects of a potential
accident.
Versions equipped with Stop/Start
system: at the end of the automatic
braking, the Stop/Start system will
activate as described in paragraph
"Stop/Start system" of this chapter.
Versions equipped with manual
gearbox: at the end of the automatic
braking the engine may stall and turn
off, unless the clutch pedal is pressed.
Versions equipped with automatic
transmission: at the end of the
braking, the latest stored gear
is engaged: the vehicle may restart after
a few seconds from the automatic
stop.
IMPORTANT After the vehicle is
stopped, the brake calipers may be
locked for about 2 seconds for safety
reasons. Make sure you press the
brake pedal if the vehicle moves slightly
forwards.

Activation/deactivation
The Forward Collision Warning Plus
system can be deactivated (and then
reactivated) via the Uconnect™
system. The system can also
be deactivated bringing the ignition
device to MAR.
IMPORTANT The system status can be
changed with vehicle at a standstill
only.

Activation/deactivation
If the Forward Collision Warning Plus
system has been correctly activated
with the Uconnect™ system, this will
be active each time the engine is
started.
To deactivate the system, hold the

button on the central tunnel pressed.

Following a deactivation, the system
will not warn the driver about the
possible collision with the preceding
vehicle, regardless of the setting
selected with the Uconnect™ system.
To reactivate the system press the

button again.

The system only works if:
❒ it is activated via the Uconnect™
system;
❒ it has not been deactivated with a
long press of the
❒ the ignition device is at MAR;

button;

❒ the vehicle speed is between 7 and
200 km/h;
❒ the front seat belts are fastened.

System limited operation
signal
If the dedicated message is displayed,
a condition limiting the system
operation may have occurred. The
possible reasons of this limitation are
something blocking the camera view or
a fault. If an obstruction is signalled,
clean the area of the windscreen
indicated in fig. 58 and check that the
message has disappeared.
In this case the system might be not
completely available.
When the conditions limiting the system
functions end, this will go back to a
normal and complete operation. Should
the fault persist, contact a Jeep
Dealership.

Driving in special conditions
In certain driving conditions, such as,
for example:
❒ driving close to a bend (see fig. 59);
❒ vehicles with small dimensions
and/or not aligned in the driving lane
(see fig. 60);
❒ lane change by other vehicles (see
fig. 61);
❒ vehicle driving in a transverse way
(see fig. 62);

❒ The system may activate, assessing
the trajectory of the vehicle, for the
presence of reflecting metal objects
different from other vehicles, such as
safety barriers, road signs, barriers
before parking areas, tollgates, level
crossings, gates, railways, objects near
road constructions sites or higher
than the vehicle (e.g. a flyover). In the
same way, the system may intervene
inside multi-storey car parks or
galleries, or due to a glare on the road
surface. These possible activations
follow the normal operating logic of the
system and must not be regarded as
faults.
❒ The system has been designed for
road use only. If the vehicle is driven
off-road, the system must be
deactivated, to avoid unnecessary
warnings. By selecting the 4WD LOW
mode, the system is automatically
deactivated. Automatic deactivation is
signalled by the dedicated warning

specifications".
The system comprises a radio-
frequency transmitter sensor fitted to
each wheel (on the rim inside the tyre),
which is able to send information on the
inflation pressure of each tyre to the
control unit.
The system automatically updates and

Important
❒ The system has not been designed
to prevent impacts and cannot detect
possible conditions leading to an
accident in advance. Failure to take into
account this warning may lead to
serious or fatal injuries.

73

IMPORTANT The TPMS is designed for
original tyres and wheels. Pressure
and alarms signalled by the TPMS are
defined according to the size of the
tyres fitted on the vehicle. Using spare
wheels of a size, type and/or design
different from the original ones may
cause an irregular operation of the
system and damage the sensors.
Aftermarket fitted wheels may damage
the sensors. Using aftermarket tyre
sealants may damage the Tyre Pressure
Monitoring System sensor. If
aftermarket tyre sealant is used it is
recommended to go to a Jeep
Dealership to have the sensors
checked. After tyre pressure check and
adjustment, always refit the valve plug
to prevent humidity and dirt from
entering, these may damage the Tyre
Pressure Monitoring System sensor.

TPMS check message
If a system failure is present, the

warning light flashes for about 75

seconds and then stays on constantly.
An acoustic signal is also issued.

TPMS deactivation
The TPMS can be deactivated by
replacing the wheels equipped with
TPMS with others that are not (e.g.
upon replacement of the wheel
assemblies in winter). Then drive the
vehicle for at least 20 minutes at a
speed higher than about 25 km/h (15
mph). The TPMS will emit an acoustic
warning, the
warning light will flash
for about 75 seconds, then will stay
on constantly and the instrument panel
will display the "TPMS check" message
with some dashes (– –) instead of the
pressure values.
At the next engine start, the system will
not emit any acoustic signal and the
display will not show the message
"TPMS check", but the dashes (– –) will
be still displayed instead of the pressure
value.

WARNING

63) The system is an aid for vehicle driving,
it DOES NOT warn the driver about
incoming vehicles outside of the detection
areas. The driver must always maintain a
sufficient level of attention to the traffic and
road conditions and for controlling the
trajectory of the vehicle.

64) The system is an aid for the driver, who
must always pay full attention while driving.
The responsibility always rests with the
driver, who must take into account the
traffic conditions in order to drive in
complete safety. The driver must always
maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in
front.
65) If the driver depresses the brake pedal
fully or carries out a fast steering during
system operation, the automatic braking
function may stop (e.g. to allow a possible
manoeuvre to avoid the obstacle).
66) The system intervenes on vehicles
travelling in the same lane. People, animals
and things (e.g. pushchairs) are not taken
into consideration.
67) If the vehicle must be placed on a roller
bench for maintenance interventions or if
it is washed in an automatic roller washing
tunnel with an obstacle in the front part
(e.g. another vehicle, a wall or another
obstacle), the system may detect its
presence and activate. In this case the
system must be deactivated through the
settings of the Uconnect™ system.
68) The presence of the TPMS does not
permit the driver to neglect regular checks
of the tyre pressure, including for the
spare wheel, and correct maintenance: the
system is not used to signal a possible
fault to a tyre.
69) Tyre pressure must be checked with
tyres rested and cold. Should it become
necessary for whatever reason to check
pressure with warm tyres, do not reduce
pressure even though it is higher than
the prescribed value. Repeat the check
when the tyres are cold.

74

70) Should one or more wheels be fitted
without sensors (e.g. if the spare wheel
is fitted), the system will no longer be
available for the replaced wheel and a
warning message will be shown on the
display, until the wheels with sensors are
fitted again.
71) The TPMS cannot indicate sudden tyre
pressure drops (e.g. if a tyre bursts). In
this case, stop the vehicle, braking with
care and avoiding sharp steering actions.
72) Replacing the normal tyres with winter
tyres and vice versa requires an inspection
of the TPMS, which should be carried
out only by a Jeep Dealership.
73) Changes in outside temperature may
cause tyre pressures to vary. The system
may temporarily indicate insufficient
pressure. In this case check the tyre
inflation pressure with the tyres cold and, if
necessary top up the inflation pressure.
74) When a tyre is removed, it is advisable
to replace the rubber gasket for the valve:
go to a Jeep Dealership. The fitting/
removal of the tyres and/or rims require
special care. To avoid damaging or fitting
the sensors incorrectly, tyre and/or rim
fitting/removal operations should only be
carried out by specialised staff. Go to a
Jeep Dealership.

WARNING

23) The system may have limited or absent
operation due to weather conditions such
as: heavy rain, hail, thick fog, heavy snow.
24) The section of the bumper before
the sensor must not be covered with
adhesives, auxiliary headlights or any other
object.
25) System intervention might be
unexpected or delayed when other vehicles
transport loads projecting from the side,
above or from the rear, with respect to the
normal size of the vehicle.
26) Operation can be adversely affected by
any structural change made to the vehicle,
such as a modification to the front
geometry, tyre change, or a heavier load
than the standard load of the vehicle.
27) Incorrect repairs made on the front part
of the vehicle (e.g. bumper, chassis) may
alter the position of the radar sensor,
and adversely affect its operation. Go to a
Jeep Dealership for any operation of this
type.
28) Do not tamper nor carry out any
intervention on the radar sensor or on the
camera on the windscreen. In the event
of a sensor failure, contact a Jeep
Dealership.
29) When towing a trailer (with modules
installed after purchasing the vehicle),
a vehicle or during loading manoeuvres on
a vehicle transporter (or in vehicle for
transport), the system must be deactivated
via the Uconnect™ system.

30) Do not wash with high-pressure jets in
the bumper lower area: in particular do
not operate on the system's electrical
connector.
31) Be careful in the case of repairs and
new paintings in the area around the
sensor (panel covering the sensor on the
left side of the bumper). In the event of
a frontal impact the sensor may
automatically deactivate and display a
warning to indicate that the sensor needs
to be repaired. Even without a malfunction
warning, deactivate the system operation
if you think that the position of the radar
sensor has changed (e.g. due to
low-speed frontal impact as during parking
manoeuvres). In these cases, go to a
Jeep Dealership to have the radar sensor
realigned or replaced.
32) The tyre quick repair kit (TireKit),
provided with the vehicle, is compatible
with the TPMS sensors. Using sealants
different from that in the original kit may
compromise its operation. If sealants not
equivalent with the original one are used, it
is recommended to have the TPMS sensor
operation checked by a qualified repair
centre.

OCCUPANT
PROTECTION
SYSTEMS
The most important safety equipment
of the vehicle comprise the following
protection systems:
❒ seat belts;
❒ SBR (Seat Belt Reminder) system;
❒ head restraints;
❒ child restraint systems;
❒ front airbags and side bags.
Read the information given the
following pages with the utmost care. It
is of fundamental importance that the
protection systems are used in the
correct way to guarantee the maximum
possible safety level for the driver and
the passengers.
For the description of the head restraint
adjustment see paragraph "Head
restraints" in chapter "Knowing your
vehicle".

75) 76)

The retractor may lock when the vehicle
is parked on a steep slope: this is
perfectly normal. Furthermore, the
retractor mechanism locks the belt if it
is pulled sharply or in the event of
sudden braking, collisions or
high-speed bends.
Wear the rear seat belts as shown in
fig. 64.

SEAT BELTS
USING THE SEAT BELTS
The driver is responsible for respecting,
and ensuring that all the other
occupants of the vehicle also respect,
the local laws in force in relation to
the use of the seat belts.
Always fasten the seat belts before
setting off.
The seat belt should be worn keeping
the torso straight and rested against
the backrest.
To fasten the seat belts, hold the
tongue A fig. 63 and insert it into the
buckle B, until it clicks into place.

64

IMPORTANT When returning the rear
seat from the tilted position to the
normal operating position, take care to
refit the seat belt correctly, in order to
guarantee prompt availability every
time.

63

J0A0168C

On removal, if the belt jams, let it rewind
for a short stretch, then pull it out
again without jerking.
To unfasten the seat belts, press button
C and guide the seat belt with your
hand while it is rewinding, to prevent it
from twisting.

ADJUSTING THE SEAT
BELT HEIGHT

77) 78)

Five different adjustments in height are
possible.
To carry out height adjustment, from
the top to the bottom, press button A
(located on both sides of handle B), and
slide the handle downwards.
The height adjuster moves upwards
even without pressing the two buttons
A.

WARNING

75) Do not press button C fig. 63 while
travelling.
76) Remember that, in the event of a
violent collision, back-seat passengers not
wearing seat belts represent a serious
danger to the front-seat passengers as well
as to themselves.
77) The height of the seat belts must be
adjusted with the vehicle stationary.
78) After the adjustment, always check that
the cursor to which the ring is fastened is
locked in one of the preset positions. To do
this, with button A fig. 65 released, exert
a further pressure to allow the locking
device to click if the grip has not
been released in one of the possible
positions.

65

J0A0151C

Always adjust the height of the seat
belts to fit the person wearing it: this
precaution could greatly reduce the risk
of injury in the event of collision.
Correct adjustment is obtained when
the belt passes approximately half way
between the shoulder and the neck.

SBR (Seat Belt
Reminder) SYSTEM
The SBR system warns the passengers
of the front and rear (where provided)
seats if their seat belt is not fastened.
The system signals unfastened seat
belts with visual warnings (warning
lights on in the instrument panel and
icons on the display) and an acoustic
signal (see the following paragraphs).
NOTE To deactivate the acoustic
warning permanently go to a Jeep
Dealership. The acoustic warning can
be reactivated at any time through
the display Menu (see the "Display"
paragraph in the “Knowing the
instrument panel” chapter).

IMPORTANT
As far as the rear seats are concerned,
the SBR system will only indicate
whether the seat belts are unfastened
(red icon) or fastened (green icon),
not the presence of any passengers.
The warning lights/icons are all off if all
seat belts (front and rear) are fastened
when the ignition device is at MAR.
For the rear seats, the icons will
activate after a few seconds after the
ignition device has been turned to
MAR, regardless of the status of the
seat belts (even if the seat belts are all
fastened).
All the warning lights/icons will come on
when at least one belt changes from
fastened to unfastened status or vice
versa.

PRETENSIONERS

79) 80) 81) 82)

33)

The vehicle is equipped with front seat
belt pretensioners, which draw back
the seat belts by several centimetres in
the event of a strong frontal impact.
This guarantees the perfect adherence
of the seat belts to the occupant's
bodies before the retention action
begins.
It is evident that the pretensioners have
been activated when the belt withdraws
toward the retractor.
This vehicle is also equipped with a
second pretensioner (fitted in the kick
plate area). Its activation is signalled by
the shortening of the metal cable.
A slight discharge of smoke may be
produced during the activation of the
pretensioner which is not harmful and
does not indicate any fire hazard.
The pretensioner does not require any
maintenance or lubrication: any
changes to its original conditions will
invalidate its efficiency.
If, due to unusual natural events (floods,
sea storms, etc.), the device has been
affected by water and/or mud, contact
a Jeep Dealership to have it replaced.

IMPORTANT To obtain the highest
degree of protection from the action of
the pretensioner, wear the seat belt
tight to the torso and pelvis.
LOAD LIMITERS
To increase safety in the event of an
accident, the front seat belt retractors
contain a load limiter which controls the
force acting on the chest and
shoulders during the belt restraining
action in the event of a head-on
collision.
GENERAL
INSTRUCTIONS FOR
USING THE SEAT BELTS
Respect and ensure that all the other
occupants of the vehicle comply with
the local laws in force regarding the use
of seat belts. Always fasten the seat
belts before setting off.
Seat belts must also be worn by
pregnant women: the risk of injury in
the event of an accident is reduced for
them and the unborn child if they are
wearing a seat belt.

79

SEAT BELTS
MAINTENANCE
For keeping the seat belts in efficient
conditions, observe the following:
❒ always use the seat belt well
stretched and never twisted; make sure
that it is free to run without
obstructions;
❒ check seat belt operation as follows:
attach the seat belt and pull it hard;
❒ replace the belt after an accident of a
certain severity even if it does not
appear to be damaged. Always replace
the seat belt if the pretensioners were
deployed;
❒ to clean the seat belts, wash by hand
with water and neutral soap, rinse and
leave to dry in the shade. Never use
strong detergents, bleach, paints or any
other chemical substance which could
damage the belt fibres;
❒ prevent the retractors from getting
wet: their correct operation is only
guaranteed if water does not get inside;
❒ replace the seat belt when it shows
wear or cuts.

70

J0A0149C

Each seat belt must be used by only
one person. Never travel with a child
sitting on the passenger's lap and
a single belt to protect them both fig.
71. In general, do not place any objects
between the person and the belt.

Pregnant women must position the
lower part of the belt very low down so
that it passes over the pelvis and under
the abdomen fig. 69. While pregnancy
increases, the driver must adjust both
seat and steering wheel to have full
control over the vehicle (pedals and
steering wheel should be easily
accessed). The maximum clearance
should be kept between the abdomen
and the steering wheel.

69

J0A0148C

The seat belt must not be twisted. The
upper part must pass over the shoulder
and cross the chest diagonally fig. 70.
The lower part must adhere to the
pelvis, not to the abdomen of the
occupant. Never use devices (clips,
clamps, etc.) that hold the seat belt
away from your body.

80

WARNING

79) The pretensioner may be used only
once. Contact a Jeep Dealership to have it
replaced after it has been deployed.
80) Removing or otherwise tampering with
seat belt and pretensioner components
is strictly prohibited. Any operations on
these components must be performed by
qualified and authorised technicians.
Always contact a Jeep Dealership.
81) For maximum safety, keep the back of
your seat upright, lean back into it and
make sure the seat belt fits closely across
your torso and pelvis. Always fasten the
seat belts for both the front and rear seats!
Travelling without wearing seat belts will
increase the risk of serious injury and even
death in the event of an accident.
82) If the belt has been subjected to high
levels of stress, for example after an
accident, it should be changed completely
together with the attachments, attachment
fixing screws and the pretensioner. In
fact, even if the belt has no visible defects,
it may have lost its resilience.

WARNING

33) Operations which lead to impacts,
vibrations or localised heating (over 100°C
for a maximum of six hours) in the area
around the pretensioner may damage or
deploy it. Contact a Jeep Dealership
should intervention be necessary on these
components.

CHILD PROTECTION
SYSTEMS
CARRYING CHILDREN
SAFELY

83) 84) 85) 86)

For optimal protection in the event of an
impact, all occupants must be seated
and wearing adequate restraint
systems, including newborn and other
children! This prescription is
compulsory in all EC countries
according to EC Directive 2003/20/EC.
Children below the height of 1.50
metres and until 12 years, must be
protected with suitable restraint
systems and be seated on the rear
seats.
Statistics on accidents indicate that the
rear seats give a better performance
when protecting children safety.
Compared with an adult, a child's head
is larger and heavier in proportion to
their body and the child's muscular and
bone structures are not fully developed.
Therefore, correct restraint systems
other than adult seat belts are
necessary to reduce as much as
possible the risk of injuries in the event
of an accident, braking or sudden
manoeuvre.

Children must be seated safely and
comfortably. Depending on the
characteristics of the child restraint
systems used, you are advised to keep
children in rearward facing child
restraint systems for as long as
possible (at least until 3–4 years old),
since this is the most protected position
in the event of an impact.
The choice of the most suitable child
restraint device depends on the weight
and size of the child. There are various
types of child restraint systems, which
can be secured to the vehicle by means
of the seat belts or with the ISOFIX/i-
Size anchorages.
It is recommended to always choose
the restraint system most suitable
for the child; for this reason always refer
to the Owner Handbook provided with
the child restraint system, to be sure
that it is of the right type for the children
it is intended for.
In Europe the characteristics of child
restraint systems are ruled by the
regulation ECE-R44, dividing them into
five weight groups:

Group

Group 0

Group 0+

Group 1

Group 2

Group 3

Weight range

up to 10 kg

up to 13 kg

9–18 kg

15–25 kg

22-36 kg

81

Group 0 and 0+
Infants up to 13 kg must be carried with
a rearward facing child restraint system
of a type as shown in fig. 72 which,
supporting the head, does not induce
stress on the neck in the event of
sudden decelerations.

72

J0A0170C

The child restraint system is secured by
the car seat belts, as shown in fig. 72
and it must restrain the child in turn
with its own belts.

Group 1
Children of weight from 9 to 18 kg may
be carried in forward facing child
restraint systems fig. 73.

The ECE-R44 standard was recently
paired with the ECE R-129 regulation,
which defines the characteristics of
the new i-Size child restraint systems
(see the "Suitability of passenger seats
for i-Size child restraint system use"
paragraph).
All restraint devices must bear the
certification data, together with the
control mark, on a label solidly fixed to
the child restraint system which must
never be removed.
Lineaccessori Jeep offers child restraint
systems for each weight group. These
devices are recommended, having
been specifically designed for Jeep
vehicles.
FITTING A CHILD

FITTING A ISOFIX CHILD
RESTRAINT SYSTEM

90) 91) 92) 93)

The rear side seats of the vehicle are
equipped with ISOFIX attachments, for
fitting child restraint systems quickly,
simply and safely.
The ISOFIX system allows the ISOFIX
child restraint systems to be fitted,
without using the vehicle's seat belt,
but directly securing the child restraint
system to three anchorages present on
the vehicle. Traditional child restraint
systems can be fitted alongside ISOFIX
child restraint systems on different
seats in the same vehicle.
To install an ISOFIX child restraint
system, attach the it to the two metal
anchorages A fig. 76 located where the
rear seat cushion meets the backrest,
then fix the upper strap (available
together with the restraint system) to
the dedicated anchorage B located at
the bottom behind the backrest.
fig. 77 shows an example of a Universal
ISOFIX child restraint system for weight
group 1.

IMPORTANT The fig. 77 is indicative
and for assembly purposes only. Fit the
child restraint system according to
the instructions, which must be
included.

SUITABILITY OF
PASSENGER SEATS FOR
i-Size CHILD RESTRAINT
SYSTEM USE
The rear side seats of the vehicle are
type-approved to house the state-
of-the-art i-Size child restraint systems.
These child restraint systems, built
and type-approved according to the
i-Size (ECE R129) standard, ensure
better safety conditions to carry
children on board a vehicle:
❒ the child must be transported
rearward facing until 15 months;
❒ child restraint system protection is
increased in the event of a side
collision;
❒ the use of the ISOFIX system is
promoted to avoid faulty installation of
the child restraint system;
❒ efficiency in the choice of the child
restraint system, which isn't made
according to weight anymore but
according to the child's height,
is increased;
❒ compatibility between the vehicle
seats and the child restraint systems is
better: the i-Size child restraint systems
can be considered as "Super ISOFIX",
this means that they can be perfectly
fitted in the type-approved i-Size seats,
but can also be fitted in the ISOFIX
(ECE R44) type-approved seats.

IMPORTANT Jeep recommends fitting the child restraint system according to the instructions, which must be included.

Main recommendations to carry
children safely
❒ Install the child restraint systems on
the rear seat, which is the most
protected position in the event of an
impact.
❒ Keep children in rearward facing child
restraint systems for as long as
possible, until 3–4 years old if possible.
❒ If the passenger's front airbag is
deactivated always check the
dedicated warning light on the panel
located on the dashboard to make sure
that it has actually been deactivated.

❒ Carefully follow the child restraint
manufacturer's instruction supplied with
the child restraint system. Keep the
instructions in the vehicle along with the
other documents and this handbook.
Do not use second-hand child restraint
systems without instructions.
❒ Only one child is to be strapped into
each restraint system; never carry
two children using one child restraint
system.
❒ Always check that the seat belts do
not rest on the child’s neck.
❒ Always check that the seat belt is
well fastened by pulling on it.
❒ While travelling, do not let the child sit
incorrectly or unfasten the belts.
❒ Never allow a child to put the belt's
diagonal section under an arm or
behind their back.

❒ Never carry children on your lap,
even newborns. No-one could restrain
them in the event of an accident.
❒ In the event of an accident, replace
the child restraint system with a new
one.

WARNING

83) SEVERE DANGER When a front
passenger airbag is fitted, do not install
rearward facing child restraint systems on
the front passenger seat. Deployment of
the airbag in an accident could cause fatal
injuries to the baby regardless of the
severity of the collision. It is advisable to
always carry children in a child restraint
system on the rear seat, which is the most
protected position in the event of an
impact.

84) On the sun visor there is a label with
suitable symbols reminding the user that it
is compulsory to deactivate the airbag if
a rearward facing child restraint system is
fitted. Always comply with the instructions
on the passenger's side sun visor (see
the "Supplementary Restraint System
(SRS) - Airbag" paragraph).
85) Should it be necessary to carry a child
on the passenger side front seat in a rear
facing child restraint system, the passenger
side front airbag and side bag must be
deactivated through the display main menu
(see the instructions in the "Display"
paragraph, "Knowing the instrument panel"
chapter), verifying activation by checking
whether the
in the panel located on the dashboard.
Move the passenger's seat as far back as
possible to avoid contact between the child
restraint system and the dashboard.
86) Do not adjust the front or rear seat if a
child is seated on it or on the dedicated
child restraint system.
87) Incorrect fitting of the child restraint
system may result in an inefficient
protection system. In the event of an
accident the child restraint system may
become loose and the child may be
injured, even fatally. When fitting a restraint
system for newborns or children, strictly
comply with the instructions provided
by the Manufacturer.

OFF LED has switched on

88) When the child restraint system is not
used, secure it with the seat belt or with
the ISOFIX anchorages, or remove it from
the vehicle. Do not leave it unsecured
inside the passenger compartment. In this
way, in the case of sudden braking or an
accident, it will not cause injuries to the
occupants.
89) After installing a child restraint system,
do not move the seat: always remove
the child restraint system before making
any adjustment.
90) Always make sure that the chest
section of the seat belt does not pass
under the arms or behind the back of the
child. In the event of an accident the seat
belt will not be able to secure the child,
with the risk of injury, including fatal injury.
Therefore the child must always wear
the seat belt correctly.
91) Do not use the same lower anchorage
to install more than one child protection
system.
92) If a Universal ISOFIX child restraint
system is not fixed to all three anchorages,
it will not be able to protect the child
correctly. In a crash, the child could be
seriously or fatally injured.
93) Fit the child restraint system only when
the vehicle is stationary. The child restraint
system is correctly fixed to the brackets
when you hear the click. Follow the
instructions for assembly, disassembly and
positioning that the Manufacturer must
supply with the child restraint system.

SUPPLEMENTARY
RESTRAINT SYSTEM
(SRS) - AIRBAG
The vehicle is equipped with:
❒ front driver airbag;
❒ front passenger airbag;
❒ driver and passenger front side bags
for pelvis, chest and shoulder
protection (Side bags);
❒ front and rear side passenger side
bags for head protection (window bag).
FRONT AIRBAGS
The front driver/passenger airbags and
the driver's knee bag (where provided)
protect the front seat occupants in
the event of frontal impacts of
medium/high severity, by placing the
bag between the occupant and the
steering wheel or dashboard.
Therefore non-activation in other types
of collisions (side impacts, rear shunts,
roll-overs, etc.) does not indicate a
system malfunction.
Driver and passenger front airbags are
not a replacement of but
complementary to the seat belts, which
should always be worn, as specified
by law in Europe and most non-
European countries.

91

Passenger side front airbag
and child restraint systems
Rearward facing child restraint systems
must NEVER be fitted on the front
seat with an active passenger side
airbag since in the event of an impact
the airbag activation may cause fatal
injuries to the transported child.
ALWAYS comply with the instructions
on the label stuck on the passenger
side sun visor fig. 82.

81

J0A0177C

In the event of impact, those not
wearing a seat belt are projected
forwards and may come into contact
with the bag which is still inflating. The
protection offered by the bag is
compromised in these circumstances.
The front airbags may not activate in
the case of a frontal impact against
highly deformable objects not involving
the front surface of the vehicle (e.g.
wing collision against guard rail) or in
the case of the vehicle wedging under
other vehicles or protective barriers
(e.g. under trucks or guard rails).
Failure to activate in the conditions
described above is due to the fact that
they may not provide any additional
protection compared with seat belts, so
their activation would be inappropriate.
In these cases, non-deployment does
not indicate a system malfunction.

SIDE BAGS
To help increase occupants protection
in the event of side impact collisions,
the vehicle is equipped with front side
bags and window bags.

Side bags
These comprise two bags located in
the front seat backrests fig. 85 which
protect the pelvis, chest and shoulder
area of the occupants in the event
of a side impact of medium/high
severity. They are marked by the
"AIRBAG" label sewn on the outer side
of the front seats.

Window bag
This comprises a "curtain" bag housed
behind the roof side linings and covered
by special trims fig. 86. They are
designed to protect the head of front
and rear occupants in the event of
a side collision, thanks to the
wide cushion inflation surface.
The deployment of side bags in the
event of side impacts of low severity is
not required.
In the event of a side impact, the
system provides best protection if the
passenger sits on the seat in a correct
position, thus allowing correct window
bag deployment.

Important
Do not wash the seats with water or
pressurised steam (wash by hand or at
automatic seat washing stations).
The front and/or side airbags
may activate in the event of sharp
impacts to the underbody of the vehicle
(e.g. impact with steps, pavements,
potholes or road bumps etc.).
When the airbag deploys it emits a
small amount of dust: the dust is
harmless and does not indicate the
beginning of a fire. The dust may irritate
the skin and eyes however: in this
case, wash with neutral soap
and water.
Airbag checking, repair and
replacement must be carried out at a
Jeep Dealership.
If the vehicle is scrapped, have the
airbag system deactivated at a Jeep
Dealership.
Pretensioners and airbags are deployed
according to different logics on the
basis of the type of collision. Failure to
deploy of one of the devices does
not necessarily indicate a system
malfunction.

WARNING

94) Do not apply stickers or other objects
on the steering wheel, on the dashboard in
the passenger side airbag area, on side
upholstery on the roof or on the seats.
Never put objects (e.g. mobile phones) on
the passenger's side dashboard since
they could interfere with correct inflation of
the airbag and also cause serious injury
to the passengers.
95) Always drive keeping your hands on
the steering wheel rim so that the airbag
can inflate freely if necessary. Do not drive
with your body bent forward. Keep your
back straight against the backrest.
96) When an active passenger airbag is
fitted, DO NOT install rearward facing child
restraint systems on the front passenger
seat. Deployment of the airbag in an
accident could cause fatal injuries to the
child regardless of the severity of the
impact. Therefore, always deactivate the
passenger side airbag when a rearward
facing child restraint system is installed on
the front passenger seat. The front
passenger seat must also be positioned
back as far as possible in order to prevent
the child restraint system from coming
into contact with the dashboard.
Immediately reactivate the passenger
airbag as soon as the child restraint system
has been removed.
97) Do not hook rigid objects to the coat
hooks and to the support handles.

98) Do not rest your head, arms or elbows
on the door, windows or the area in which
the window bag is located to avoid
possible injury during inflation.
99)
Never lean head, arms and
elbows out of the window

100) If the
warning light does not
switch on when the ignition device is
moved to MAR or if it stays on when
driving, there might be a fault in the
restraint systems; in this case, the airbags
or pretensioners may not deploy in the
event of an accident or, in a lower number
of cases, they could deploy erroneously.
Before proceeding, contact a Jeep
Dealership immediately to have the system
checked.
101) On some versions, if the
OFF LED
(located on the dashboard panel) is faulty,
lights up in the instrument
warning light
panel.
102) If a side bag is present, do not cover
the front seat backrests with extra covers.
103) Do not travel carrying objects in
your lap, in front of your chest or between
your lips (pipe, pencils, etc.). They could
cause severe injury if the airbag is
deployed.
104) If the has been subject to theft,
attempted theft, vandalism, or flooding,
have the airbag system inspected at a
Jeep Dealership.

105) If the ignition device is at MAR, even if
the engine is switched off, airbags may
be deployed when the vehicle is stationary
and hit by another vehicle. Therefore,
even if the vehicle is stationary, when an
active front passenger airbag is fitted, DO
NOT install rearward facing child restraint
systems on the front passenger seat.
Deployment of the airbag following an
impact could cause fatal injuries to the
child. Therefore, always deactivate the
passenger side airbag when a rearward
facing child restraint system is installed on
the front passenger seat. The front
passenger seat must also be positioned
back as far as possible in order to prevent
the child restraint system from coming
into contact with the dashboard.
Immediately reactivate the passenger
airbag as soon as the child restraint system
has been removed. Finally, remember that
if the ignition device is at STOP, no safety
device (airbags or pretensioners) will
activate following an impact; therefore if
these devices do not activate this cannot
be considered as signal of the system
malfunction.
106) If the airbag failure warning light is
faulty this will be signalled by an airbag
failure icon lighting up in the instrument
panel display with a dedicated message.
The pyrotechnic charges are not disabled.
Before proceeding, contact a Jeep
Dealership immediately to have the system
checked.
107) The front airbag deployment threshold
is higher than that of the pretensioners.
When the impact is between the two
deployment thresholds, it is normal that
pretensioners only are engaged.

Y

96

108) The airbag does not replace seat
belts, but increases their efficiency.
Because front airbags are not deployed for
low-speed crashes, side collisions,
rear-end shunts or rollovers, occupants are
protected, in addition to any side bags,
only by their seat belts, which must
therefore always be fastened.

device to STOP and then back to MAR.
If the warning light (or the symbol on
the display) remains on, try with the
other keys provided with the vehicle.
Contact a Jeep Dealership if the engine
still does not start.

STOPPING THE ENGINE
Proceed as follows:
❒ park the car in a position that is not
dangerous for oncoming traffic; engage
a gear (versions with manual gearbox)
or position the gear lever to P (Parking)
(versions with automatic transmission);
❒ turn the ignition device to STOP
with the engine idling.

Cars equipped with electronic key
(Keyless Enter-N-Go): at a car speed
over 8 km/h (5 mph) it is possible to
switch the engine off, also with
automatic transmission lever in a
position other than P (Parking). To
switch off the engine in this situation,
hold down the ignition device button for
a while or press it 3 times in a row
within a few seconds. In this case the
engine will stop and the ignition device
will switch to MAR.

WARNING

109) It is dangerous to run the engine in
enclosed areas. The engine takes in
oxygen and releases carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide and other toxic gases.
110) The brake servo is not active until the
engine is started, so you would need to
apply much more force than usual to the
brake pedal.

99

111) Do not start the engine by pushing,
towing or driving downhill. These
manoeuvres may damage the catalytic
converter.

WARNING

34) In the first period of use, i.e. in the first
1,600 km (1,000 miles), we recommend
not to demand maximum performance
from the vehicle (for instance excessive
accelerations, extended travel at maximum
speed, sudden braking, etc.).
35) With the engine off, do not leave the
ignition device at MAR to prevent the
battery from draining.
36) A quick burst on the accelerator before
turning off the engine serves absolutely
no practical purpose; it wastes fuel and is
damaging for the engine.
37) Warning light
starting or during prolonged cranking to
indicate a fault with the glow plug heating
system. If the engine starts, the vehicle can
be regularly used, but a Jeep Dealership
must be contacted as soon as possible.

J0A0281C

IMPORTANT Always engage the
electronic parking brake before leaving
the vehicle.

IMPORTANT In addition to parking the
vehicle with the parking brake always
engaged, the wheel steered, chocks or
stones positioned in front of the wheels
(when on a steep slope), a gear must
always be engaged (the 1st gear with
the vehicle parked uphill or the reverse
gear with the vehicle parked downhill).
On versions with automatic
transmission, place the gear lever at P
(Park).

IMPORTANT Should the vehicle battery
be faulty, to unlock the electric parking
brake the battery must be replaced.
The electric parking brake can be
engaged in two ways:

A slight movement of the brake pedal
may be detected when engaging the
electric parking brake with the brake
pedal pressed.
With the electric parking brake
engaged, the warning light
on the
instrument panel and the LED on the
switch turn on.

IMPORTANT With the EPB failure
warning light on, some functions of the
electric parking brake are deactivated.
In this case the driver is responsible
for brake activation and vehicle parking
in complete safety conditions.
If, under exceptional circumstances, the
use of the brake is required with the
vehicle in motion, keep the switch on
the central tunnel pulled as long as the
brake action is necessary.
The warning light
may switch on
with the hydraulic system temporarily
unavailable; in this case braking is
controlled by the motors.
The brake lights (stop) will also
automatically switch on in the same
way as for normal braking with the use
of the brake pedal.
Release the switch on the central tunnel
to stop the braking action with the
vehicle in motion.

If, through this procedure, the vehicle is
braked until a speed below 3 km/h is
reached and the switch is kept pulled,
the parking brake will definitively
engage.

IMPORTANT Driving the vehicle with
the electric parking brake engaged, or
using it several times to slow down
the vehicle, may cause severe damage
to the braking system.

Disengaging the electric
parking brake manually
To manually disengage the parking
brake, the ignition device must be at
MAR. It is also necessary to press the
brake pedal, then slightly press the
switch on the central tunnel.

ELECTRIC PARKING
BRAKE OPERATING
MODES
The electric parking brake may operate
as follows:
❒ "Dynamic operating mode": this
mode is activated by pulling the switch
repeatedly whilst deriving;
❒ "Static engagement and release
mode": with the vehicle stationary, the
electric parking brake can be activated
by pulling the switch on the central
tunnel once. On the other hand, press
the switch and the brake pedal at
the same time to disengage the brake;

101

❒ "Drive Away Release": (where
available) the electric parking brake will
automatically disengage with the driver
side seat belt fastened and the
detection of an action performed by the
driver to move the vehicle (forward
gear or reverse gear);
❒ "Safe Hold": when the vehicle speed
is lower than 3 km/h, the gear lever is
not at P (Park) on versions with
automatic transmission and when the
intention of the driver to leave the
vehicle is detected, the electric parking
brake will automatically engage so
that the vehicle is in safe conditions.

❒ "Auto Park Brake": if the vehicle
speed is lower than 3 km/h, the electric
parking brake will automatically engage
with the gear lever moved to P (Park)
position (versions with automatic
transmission), or with the ignition device
at STOP (versions with manual
gearbox). The LED on the switch fig. 87
located on the central tunnel switches
on together with the warning light

on the instrument panel when the
parking brake is engaged and applied
to the wheels. Each automatic parking
brake engagement can be cancelled by
pressing the switch on the central
tunnel and moving at the same time the
gear lever for the automatic
transmission to position P (Park) or the
ignition device to STOP (versions with
manual gearbox).
SAFE HOLD
It is a safety function that automatically
engages the electric parking brake in
the event of a dangerous condition for
the vehicle.
If:
❒ the vehicle speed is below 3 km/h;
❒ the gear lever is not at P (Park)
(versions with automatic transmission);
❒ the driver's seat belt is not fastened;
❒ the driver side door is open;

❒ no attempted operation of the brake
pedal or, on versions with manual
gearbox, the clutch pedal or the
accelerator pedal is detected;
the parking brake engages
automatically to prevent the vehicle
movement.
The Safe Hold function can be
temporarily disabled by pressing the
switch located on the central tunnel
and the brake pedal at the same time,
with the vehicle stationary and the
driver side door open.
Once disabled, the function will activate
again when the vehicle speed reaches
20 km/h or the ignition device is moved
to STOP and then to MAR.

WARNING

112) In the case of parking manoeuvres on
roads on a gradient, the front wheels
must be steered towards the pavement
(when parking downhill), or in the opposite
direction if the vehicle is parked uphill. If
the vehicle is parked on a steep slope, it is
advisable to block the wheels with a
wedge or stone.
113) Never leave children unattended in
the vehicle. Always remove the key from
the ignition device when leaving the vehicle
and take it with you.
114) The electric parking brake must
always be engaged when leaving
the vehicle.

J0A0183C

To engage 6th gear, operate the lever
by pressing it towards the right in order
to avoid engaging 4th gear by mistake.
The same applies to the shift from
6th to 5th gear.

IMPORTANT Reverse can only be
engaged when the vehicle is completely
stationary. With the engine running,
wait for at least 2 seconds with the
clutch pedal fully pressed before
engaging reverse to prevent damage to
the gears and grating.

IMPORTANT The clutch pedal should
be used only for gear changes. Do
not drive with your foot resting on the
clutch pedal, however lightly. In some
circumstances, the electronic clutch
control could cut in by interpreting the
incorrect driving style as a fault.

WARNING

115) Depress the clutch pedal fully to
change gear correctly. It is therefore
essential that there is nothing under the
pedals: make sure the mats are lying
flat and do not get in the way of the
pedals.

WARNING

38) Do not drive with your hand resting on
the gear lever as the force exerted, even
if slight, could lead over time to premature
wear of the gearbox internal components.

AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION

The vehicle can be equipped with a
9-speed automatic transmission.
The transmission can operate in two
different modes: "Automatic mode" or
"Sequential mode".
GEAR LEVER
The lever has the following positions:
❒ P = Park
❒ R = Reverse
❒ N = Neutral
❒ D = Drive, (automatic forward speed)
❒ AutoStick: + shifting to higher gear
in sequential driving mode; – shifting
to lower gear in sequential driving
mode.

To select a gear, press button A fig. 89
and move the lever forwards or
backwards.
If the transmission is used in
"sequential" mode, which is activated
moving the lever from D (Drive) to
the left, the various positions can be
reached towards + or – . These
positions are unstable.
To exit position P (Park), or to pass from
position N (Neutral) to position D (Drive)
or R (Reverse) when the vehicle is
stopped or is moving at a low speed,
the brake pedal must be pressed either
(see "Gear engagement disabling
system with brake engaged" in this
chapter).

IMPORTANT DO NOT accelerate while
shifting from position P (or N) to another
position.

IMPORTANT After selecting a gear, wait
a few seconds before accelerating.
This precaution is particularly important
with engine cold.

AutoStick - Sequential
shifting mode
In the case of frequent gearshiftings
(e.g. when the vehicle is driven with a
heavy load, on slopes, with strong
headwind or when towing heavy
trailers), it is recommended to use the
AutoStick (sequential shifting) mode
to select and keep a lower fixed ratio.
It is possible to shift from position D
(Drive) to the sequential mode
regardless of vehicle speed.

Activation
With gear lever in position D (Drive), to
activate the sequential drive mode,
move the lever to the left (– and +
indication of the trim). The gear
engaged will be shown on the display.
Gearshifting is made by moving the
gear lever forwards, towards symbol –
or backwards, towards symbol +.

Deactivation
Bring the gear lever back in position D
(Drive) ("automatic" driving mode).

TRANSMISSION
EMERGENCY FUNCTION
(where provided)
Transmission operation is constantly
monitored to detect any fault. If a
condition that might damage the
transmission is detected, the
"transmission emergency" function is
activated.
In this condition, the transmission stays
in 4th gear, regardless of the selected
gear.
Positions P (Parking), R (Reverse) e N
(Neutral) still work. Icon might light
up in the display
In the event of a "transmission
emergency" immediately contact the
nearest Jeep Dealership.

Temporary failure
In the event of a temporary failure, the
transmission correct operation can
be restored for all the forwards gears by
proceeding as follows:
❒ stop the vehicle;
❒ bring the transmission lever to P
(Park).
❒ bring the ignition device to STOP;
❒ wait for about 10 seconds, then
restart the engine;
❒ select the desired gear: if the
problem is not detected anymore the
transmission correct operation is
restored.

119) Before moving the gear lever from
position P, bring the ignition device to
position MAR and press the brake pedal.
Otherwise the gear lever might be
damaged.
120) Engage the reverse gear only with
vehicle at a standstill, engine idling and
accelerator completely released.

IMPORTANT In the event of a
temporary failure it is anyway
recommended to contact a Jeep
Dealership as soon as possible.
IGNITION LOCK AND
PARK POSITION
Versions equipped with the Keyless
Enter-N-Go system: this function
requires the gear lever to be positioned
to P (Park) before bringing the ignition
device to position STOP.
Versions equipped with mechanical
key: this function requires the gear
lever to be positioned to P (Park) before
extracting the key from the ignition
device.
If the vehicle battery is flat and the
ignition key is engaged, the latter is
locked in position. To remove the key
manually see paragraph "Automatic
transmission lever unlock" in chapter "In
an emergency".

GEAR ENGAGEMENT
DISABLING SYSTEM
WITHOUT BRAKE PEDAL
PRESSED
This system prevents you from moving
the gear lever from position P (Park) if
the brake pedal has not been previously
depressed.
To bring the gear lever to a position
other than P (Park), the ignition device
must be in position AVV (engine on
or off) and the brake pedal must be
depressed.

WARNING

116) Never use position P instead of the
electric parking brake. When the vehicle is
parked, always engage the electric parking
brake to prevent accidental movements
of the vehicle.
117) If position P is not engaged the
vehicle might move and hurt people.
Before leaving the vehicle make sure that
the gear lever is in position P and the
electric parking brake is engaged.
118) Do not position the gear lever to N,
nor switch off the engine to travel
downhills. This type of driving is dangerous
and reduces the possibility of intervening
in the case of variation of the road traffic or
surface. You risk to lose control of your
vehicle and cause accidents.

❒ AUTO (Automatic): the 4WD mode
with continuous and automatic
operation can be used while driving on
road and off-road. This mode reduces
fuel consumption, because the
propeller shaft can be disconnected,
whenever required.
❒ SNOW : this mode can achieve more
stability on slippery or snow-covered
grounds. To be used for driving on-road
and off-road in the case of grounds
with poor grip, such as roads covered
by snow.
❒ SAND : off-road driving mode to be
used on grounds with poor grip, such
as muddy surfaces. The transmission is
set to offer a maximum traction.
❒ MUD : off-road driving mode for
surfaces with poor grip, such as
mud-covered grounds or wet grass.
❒ ROCK (where provided, for Trailhawk
versions only): this mode is only
available if the 4WD LOW mode is
activated. The device sets the vehicle to
maximise traction and give the highest
steering capacity on off-road surfaces
featuring a high grip. This mode offers
the best performance when driving
"off-road". This mode must be used to
pass over obstacles at slow speed,
such as large rocks, deep cracks, etc.

The sensors warn the driver about the
presence of obstacles with an
intermittent acoustic signal and, where
provided, also with visual indications
on the instrument panel display.

112

❒ the signals sent by the sensor can
also be altered by the presence of
ultrasonic systems (e.g. pneumatic
brake systems of trucks or pneumatic
drills) near the vehicle;
❒ Parking assistance system
performance can also be influenced by
the position of the sensors, for example
due to a change in the ride setting
(caused by wear to the shock
absorbers, suspension), or by changing
tyres, overloading the vehicle or
carrying out specific tuning operations
that require the vehicle to be lowered.
❒ the presence of a tow hook without
trailer, which may interfere with the
correct operation of the parking
sensors.
❒ the presence of adhesives on the
sensors. Thus take care not to place
adhesives on the sensors.

The sensors are automatically
reactivated when the trailer's cable plug
is removed. Before using the Park-
Sense® system, it is recommended to
remove the tow hook ball assembly and
the relevant attachment from the vehi-
cle when the latter is not used for tow-
ing operations. Failure to comply with
this prescription may cause personal
injuries or damages to vehicles or
obstacles since, when the continuous
acoustic signal is emitted, the tow hook
ball is already in a position that is much
closer to the obstacle than the rear
bumper.
In addition, the sensors may detect the
tow hook ball assembly and the
relevant attachment (depending on its
size and shape), providing a false
indication of the presence of an
obstacle in the area behind the vehicle.
GENERAL WARNINGS
Some conditions may influence the
performance of the parking system:
❒ reduced sensor sensitivity and a
reduction in the parking assistance
system performance could be due to
the presence of: ice, snow, mud, thick
paint, on the surface of the sensor;
❒ the sensor may detect a non-existent
obstacle ("echo interference") due to
mechanical interference, for example
when washing the vehicle, in rain
(strong wind), hail;

WARNING

126) Parking and other potentially
dangerous manoeuvres are, however,
always the driver’s responsibility. When
performing these operations, always make
sure that there are no other people
(especially children) or animals on the route
you want to drive into. The parking
sensors are an aid for the driver, but the
driver must never allow their attention
to lapse during potentially dangerous
manoeuvres, even those executed at low
speeds.

WARNING

42) The sensors must be clean of mud,
dirt, snow or ice in order for the system to
operate correctly. Be careful not to scratch
or damage the sensors while cleaning
them. Avoid using dry, rough or hard
cloths. The sensors should be washed
using clean water with the addition of car
shampoo if necessary. When using special
washing equipment such as high pressure
jets or steam cleaning, clean the sensors
very quickly keeping the jet more than
10 cm away.

LANESENSE
SYSTEM (lane
crossing warning)

DESCRIPTION

44) 45) 46) 47) 48) 49)

The LaneSense system makes use of a
camera located on the windscreen to
detect the lane limits and calculate
the position of the vehicle within such
limits, in order to make sure that it
remains inside the lane.
When both limits of the lane are
detected and the vehicle crosses one of
them without the awareness of the
driver (direction indicator off), the
system provides a tactile warning by
applying torque to the steering wheel,
signalling the driver that he must take
an action to remain into the lane.
If the vehicle continues going beyond
the line of the lane without any
intervention from the driver, the

warning light (or the corresponding

graphic icon on the reconfigurable
multifunction display) will be displayed
on the instrument panel to urge the
driver to bring the vehicle back into the
limits of the lane.

IMPORTANT The system monitors the
presence of the driver's hands on
the steering wheel. If they are
not detected, the system emits an
acoustic signal and deactivates until it is
reactivated by pressing the dedicated
button.
When one limit of the lane is detected
and the vehicle crosses it (direction
indicator off), warning light
(or the
icon on the reconfigurable multifunction
display) will be displayed on the
instrument panel to urge the driver to
bring the vehicle back into the lane.
In this case, the tactile warning (torque
on the steering wheel) is not provided.
SYSTEM ACTIVATION/
DEACTIVATION
When the engine is started the system
is activated (LED on button
off). Each time the engine is started, the
system keeps the activation status
there was when it was previously
switched off.

fig. 98

Activation conditions
Once switched on, the system
becomes active only if the following
conditions are met:
❒ the driver always keeps at least one
hand on the steering wheel;

98

J0A0052C

❒ vehicle speed ranges within 60 km/h
and 180 km/h (or equivalent values in
miles);
❒ the lane limit lines are perfectly visible
on both sides;
❒ there are suitable visibility conditions;
❒ the road is straight or with wide
radius bends;
❒ a suitable distance is kept from the
vehicle in front;
❒ the direction indicator (for leaving the
lane) is not active;
❒ the lane limit lines are perfectly visible
on both sides (for activation of the
tactile warning only).
NOTE The system does not apply
torque to the steering wheel every time
a safety system is activated (brakes,
ABS, ASR system, ESC system,
Forward Collision Warning Plus system,
etc.).

114

48) Do not tamper nor operate on the
camera. Do not close the openings in the
aesthetic cover located under the interior
rear view mirror. In the event of a failure
of the camera, contact a Jeep Dealership.
49) Do not cover the operating range of the
camera with stickers or other objects.
Also pay attention to other objects on the
bonnet (e.g. a layer of snow) and make
sure they do not interfere with the camera.

WARNING

44) The camera may have limited or absent
operation due to weather conditions such
as: heavy rain, hail, thick fog, heavy snow,
formation of ice layers on the windscreen.
45) Camera operation may also be
compromised by the presence of dust,
condensation, dirt or ice on the
windscreen, by traffic conditions (e.g.
vehicles that are driving not aligned with
yours, vehicle driving in a transverse or
opposite way on the same lane, bend with
a small radius of curvature), by road
surface conditions and by driving
conditions (e.g. off-road driving). Make sure
the windscreen is always clean. Use
specific detergents and clean cloths to
avoid scratching the windscreen. The
camera operation may also be limited or
absent in some driving, traffic and road
surface conditions.
46) Projecting loads on the roof of the
vehicle may interfere with the correct
operation of the camera. Before starting
make sure the load is correctly positioned,
in order not to cover the camera operating
range.
47) If the windscreen must be replaced
due to scratches, chipping or breakage,
contact exclusively a Jeep Dealership. Do
not replace the windscreen on your own,
risk of malfunction! It is advisable to replace
the windscreen if it is damaged in the area
of the camera.

IMPORTANT When parking, take the
utmost care over obstacles that may be
above or under the camera range.

WARNING

50) It is vital, for correct operation, that the
camera is always kept clean and free
from mud, dirt, snow or ice. Be careful not
to scratch or damage the camera while
cleaning it. Avoid using dry, rough or hard
cloths. The camera must be washed
using clean water, with the addition of car
shampoo if necessary. In washing stations
which use steam or high-pressure jets,
clean the camera quickly, keeping the
nozzle more than 10 cm away from the
sensors. Do not apply stickers to the
camera.

WARNING

127) Parking and other potentially
dangerous manoeuvres are, however,
always the driver’s responsibility. While
carrying out these manoeuvres, always
make sure that no people (especially
children) or animals are in the area
concerned. The camera is an aid for the
driver, but the driver must never allow
his/her attention to lapse during potentially
dangerous manoeuvres, even those
executed at low speeds. Always keep a
slow speed, so as to promptly brake in the
case of obstacles.

Installing the ball head tow
bar
Remove the plug from the mounting
pipe.
The ball head tow bar is usually in the
released position when taken out from
the luggage compartment. This can
be observed by the knob spaced from
the tow bar, corresponding to a slot
of approximately 5 mm (see fig. 101)
and by the red mark on the knob
directed to the green mark on the tow
bar. The tow bar can be installed only
when in these conditions.

If the locking mechanism of the tow bar
is disengaged before the installation,
or at any other time, and is in the
locked position, it must be pre-loaded.
The locked position can be identified
by the green mark of the knob
coinciding with the green mark of the
tow bar and by the knob in the stop
position on the tow bar, namely without
slot (see figure).
The locking mechanism is pre-loaded
as follows:
❒ with key inserted and lock open,
extract the knob following the direction
of arrow A fig. 101;
❒ then follow the direction of arrow B,
until it stops.
The release ball is pre-loaded and the
locking mechanism remains in the
pre-loading position even when the
knob is released.
The release lever is engaged and the
locking mechanism remains in the
pre-loading position even when the
knob is released.
The tow bar must be inserted in the
housing pipe with the coupling pin for
the installation. Insert from the bottom
and push upwards: the mechanism
locks automatically.
IMPORTANT To prevent injury to limbs,
keep hands away from the knob when
locking.

Close the lock and always remove the
key. The key cannot be removed when
the lock is released. Then fit the
protection cap on the lock.

Removing the tow bar
Proceed as follows:
❒ remove the protection cap from the
lock and press it on the key grip. Open
the lock with the key;
❒ grip the tow bar firmly, remove the
knob following the direction of arrow A
fig. 101, then rotate in the direction
of arrow B until it stops, in order to
release it in unlocked position. Then
remove the tow bar from the housing
pipe. The knob can then be released (it
will automatically stop in released
position);
❒ arrange the tow bar in the luggage
compartment so that it cannot be
dirtied and/or damaged by other
transported objects;
❒ finally, insert the dedicated plug in the
mounting pipe.

Important
Apply the plate in a highly visible point
of the vehicle, near the mounting pipe
or inside the luggage compartment.

To ensure correct operation of the
system, periodically remove all deposits
of dirt which may have accumulated
on the ball head bar and from the
mounting pipe. The lock must only be
treated with graphite.
Periodically lubricate the joints, the
sliding surfaces and the balls with
grease without resin or oil. Lubrication
is also a further corrosion protection.
if the vehicle is washed with high-
pressure jets, the ball head bar must be
removed and the dedicated plug fitted.
The ball head bar must never be
treated with high-pressure jets.
Two keys are supplied together with the
removable ball tow bar. Note down
the four-digit key number and keep it in
a safe place. This number is to be
used for ordering any duplicate keys
that may be required.

IMPORTANT To install a tow hook

52)

GENERAL
INSTRUCTIONS
❒ Before replacing a bulb check the
contacts for oxidation;
❒ replace blown bulbs with others of
the same type and power;
❒ after replacing a headlight bulb,
always check its alignment;
❒ when a light is not working, check
that the corresponding fuse is intact
before replacing the bulb. For the
location of fuses, refer to the paragraph
“If a fuse blows” in this chapter.

IMPORTANT When the weather is cold
or damp or after heavy rain or washing,
the surface of headlights or rear lights
may steam up and/or form drops of
condensation on the inside. This is
a natural phenomenon due to the
difference in temperature and humidity
between the inside and the outside
of the glass which does not indicate a
fault and does not compromise the
normal operation of lighting devices.
The mist disappears quickly when the
lights are turned on, starting from
the centre of the diffuser, extending
progressively towards the edges.

BURNS!
134) Changes or repairs to the electrical
system carried out incorrectly and without
due consideration for the technical
specifications of the system may lead to
malfunctioning and generate a fire hazard.
135) Halogen bulbs contain pressurised
gas. If they break, glass fragments could fly
everywhere.

WARNING

52) Halogen bulbs must be handled by
holding the metallic part only. Touching the
transparent part of the bulb with your
fingers may reduce the intensity of the
emitted light and even reduce the lifespan
of the bulb. In the case of accidental
contact, rub the lamp with a cloth and

Important information about
the jack
Please note that:
❒ the weight of the jack is 2.8 kg;
❒ the jack requires no adjustment;
❒ the jack cannot be repaired: in the
event of a fault it must be replaced by
another original one;

❒ no tool other than its cranking device
may be fitted on the jack.
Then proceed as follows:
❒ should it be necessary to stop the
vehicle on a road with a gradient,
especially a very high one, or on an
unstable surface, take chock A and fold
it out, as shown in the diagram in fig.
134;

134

J0A0157C

❒ alert any bystander that the vehicle is
about to be raised: all persons should
be kept away from the vehicle and
nobody must touch it until it has been
lowered. Nor should any occupant
remain in the vehicle;
❒ if the vehicle has alloy wheels, where
the hub cap covers the bolts, use the
key with great care to remove the
hub cap before raising the vehicle;

136

❒ before raising the vehicle, loosen –
without removing – the bolts on the
wheel with the flat tyre using key A fig.
135. With the wheel still resting on
the ground, a single anticlockwise
rotation of the bolts will be enough;

135

J0A0249C

❒ position the jack under the vehicle,
near the wheel to be changed;
❒ fit key D fig. 136 on hexagon A of
jack B and turn it clockwise until the
jack’s bracket is inserted firmly in the
under-door side member lifting area,
taking care to keep the staff aligned
with the notch indicated by symbol

on the under-door trim;

❒ lift the vehicle until the wheel is a few
centimetres off the ground;
❒ remove the bolts and the wheel (for
versions with hub cap, remove it after
loosening the 4 bolts that fix it and,
finally, undo the last bolt and remove
the wheel);

136

J0A0422C

❒ remove the key from the jack and
insert the locating pin in the hub cap (in
the case of alloy wheels)to facilitate
fitting of the spare wheel;
❒ make sure the contact surfaces
between spare wheel and hub
are clean so that the fixing bolts will not
become loose subsequently;
❒ fit the spare wheel;
❒ fit and do up the bolts, without
tightening them;
❒ if used, remove the alignment pin;
❒ operate the jack and completely
lower the vehicle;
❒ take the spare wheel, jack and wheel
bolt removal key (see fig. 133);
❒ if the vehicle has aluminium rims,
where the hub cap covers the bolts,
use the key with great care to remove
the hub cap before raising the vehicle;

❒ tighten the bolts, alternating from one
bolt to the one opposite, according to
the numerical sequence illustrated in
fig. 137. In the case of any doubts
regarding the bolt tightening torque,
contact a Jeep Dealership;
❒ reposition the jack, the tools, the
chock and the flat tyre inside the
luggage compartment, ensuring that
they are locked correctly.

137

J0A0159C

IMPORTANT
❒ Should it be absolutely necessary to
operate on the road surface or near
it, pay the utmost attention to vehicles
in transit.
❒ Pay particular attention when using
the key to remove the bolts: it may have
sharp edges.

❒ Raising the vehicle any more than
necessary may lower its stability: the
jack may slip and injure those nearby.
Do not raise the vehicle any more
than required for the removal of the
wheel.
❒ Tyres with unidirectional tread can be
recognised by arrows on the side of
the tyre which indicate the direction of
rotation. This must of necessity be
complied with. Only in this way can the
tyres maintain their characteristics in
terms of grip, noise, resistance to wear
and drainage on wet surfaces.
❒ If, after a puncture, it is necessary to
fit such a tyre the wrong way round,
it will be necessary to continue driving
with great care, since the tyre’s
performance is limited in these
conditions. This precaution must be
borne in mind above all when the road
surface is wet.
❒ In order to benefit completely from
the unidirectional tread, it is advisable to
restore all wheels to the correct
direction of rotation as soon as
possible.
❒ Make sure that the spare wheel is
fitted with the valve facing outwards.
The wheel may be damaged if fitted
incorrectly.

138

❒ If the vehicle has a hub cap or wheel
cover, do not attempt to fit it on the
spare wheel.
❒ To prevent injury to persons, the
complete tightening of the bolts must
only be carried out when all of the
vehicle’s wheels are on the ground, to
prevent the vehicle falling from the jack.
❒ After having travelled for about
40 km, stop and check that the bolts
are tightened correctly.

WARNING

141) If left in the passenger compartment,
the punctured wheel and jack constitute
a serious risk to the safety of occupants in
the event of accidents or sharp braking.
Therefore, always place both the jack and
punctured wheel in the dedicated housing
in the luggage compartment.
142) It is extremely dangerous to attempt
to change a wheel on the side of the
vehicle next to the driving lane: make sure
that the vehicle is at a sufficient distance
from the road, to avoid being run over.
143) Indicate the presence of the stationary
vehicle in accordance with current
regulations: hazard warning lights, warning
triangle, etc. Those on board should get
out of the vehicle, particularly if it is heavily
laden, and wait for the wheel to be
changed away from the threat posed by
the traffic. On slopes or on unsurfaced
roads, chock the wheels with the chocks
provided.

144) The vehicle's driving characteristics
will be modified with the space-saver wheel
fitted. Avoid violent acceleration and
braking, abrupt steering and fast cornering.
The overall duration of the space-saver
wheel is of about 3000 km, after which the
relevant tyre must be replaced with another
one of the same type. Never install a
standard tyre on a rim that is designed for
use with a space-saver wheel. Have the
wheel repaired and refitted as soon as
possible. Using two or more space-saver
wheels at the same time is forbidden.
Do not grease the threads of the bolts
before fitting them: they might slip out
when driving!
145) The space-saver wheel (where
provided) is specific to your vehicle: do not
use it on other models, or use the
space-saver wheel of other models on your
vehicle. The space-saver wheel must only
be used in the event of emergency. It
must only be used for the distance
necessary to reach a service point and the
vehicle speed must not exceed 80 km/h.
The space-saver wheel has an orange label
that summarises the main cautions for
use and limitations. Never remove or cover
the label. Never apply a hub cap on a
space-saver wheel.

146) The jack is a tool developed and
designed only for changing a wheel, if a
tyre gets punctured or damaged, on the
vehicle with which it is supplied or on other
vehicles of the same model. It must not
be used, for example, to jack other vehicle
models or objects. Never use the jack to
carry out maintenance or repairs under the
vehicle. Never position yourself under a
jacked vehicle. Should it be necessary to
work under the vehicle, contact a Jeep
Dealership. Incorrectly positioning the jack
may cause the vehicle to fall: use it only
in the positions indicated. Do not use the
jack for loads higher than the one shown
on its label.
147) The space-saver wheel cannot be
fitted with snow chains. If a front (drive) tyre
is punctured and chains are needed, use
a standard wheel from the rear axle and
install the space-saver wheel on the rear
axle. In this way, with two normal drive
wheels at the front axle, it is possible to use
snow chains.
148) Incorrect hub cap assembly, if
present, may cause it to come off when the
vehicle is moving. Never tamper with the
inflation valve. Never introduce tools of any
kind between the rim and the tyre. Check
tyre and space-saver wheel pressures
regularly, complying with the values given in
the "Technical specifications" chapter.

TIREKIT

❒ make sure that the switch for the
compressor is in position 0 (off), start
the engine, insert the plug into the
luggage compartment power socket or
on central tunnel and switch on the
compressor by bringing the switch to
position I (on);
❒ inflate the tyre to the pressure
indicated in the “Wheels” paragraph
(see “Technical data” chapter). In order
to obtain a more precise reading, check
the pressure value on pressure gauge
B with the compressor off;
❒ if after five minutes it is still impossible
to reach at least 1.8 bar, disengage
the compressor from the valve and
power socket, then move the vehicle
forwards by approx. ten metres in order
to distribute the sealing fluid inside the
tyre evenly, then repeat the inflation
operation;
❒ if after this operation you still cannot
reach at least 1.8 bar after 5 minutes
from switching on the compressor,
do not resume driving but contact a
Jeep Dealership;
❒ after having driven for about 10
minutes, stop and re-check the tyre
pressure; remember to engage the
electric parking brake;

❒ if a pressure value of at least 1.8 bar
is detected, restore the correct
pressure (with engine running and
electric parking brake), resume driving
immediately and drive with great care to
a Jeep Dealership.

WARNING

149) Punctures on the sides of the tyre
may not be repaired. Do not use the TireKit
if the tyre is damaged due to travelling
when flat.
150) Wear the protective gloves provided
with the TireKit.
151) Apply the adhesive label where it can
be easily seen by the driver as a reminder
that the tyre has been treated with the
TireKit. Drive carefully, particularly on
bends. Do not exceed 80 km/h. Do not
accelerate or brake suddenly.
152) If the pressure has fallen below 1.8
bar, do not drive any further: the TireKit
cannot guarantee proper hold because the
tyre is too damaged. Contact a Jeep
Dealership.
153) You must always indicate that the tyre
was repaired using the TireKit. Give the
leaflet to the technicians who will be
handling the tyre that was treated using the
TireKit.
154) Repair is not possible if the wheel rim
is damaged (groove is deformed, causing
air to escape). Do not remove foreign
bodies (screws or nails) from the tyre.

155) Do not operate the compressor for
longer than 20 minutes consecutively. Risk
of overheating. The TireKit is not suitable
for definitive repairs, so the repaired tyres
may only be used temporarily.
156) The bottle contains ethylene glycol
and latex: it may cause an allergic reaction.
It is harmful if swallowed. It is irritant for
the eyes. It may cause sensitisation if
inhaled or on contact. Avoid contact with
eyes, skin and clothes. In the case of
contact, wash immediately with plenty of
water. In the event that it is swallowed, do
not induce vomiting. Rinse out your mouth,
drink large quantities of water and seek
immediate medical attention. Keep out of
the reach of children. The product must
not be used by asthmatics. Do not inhale
the vapours during insertion and suction.
Call a doctor immediately if allergic
reactions are noted. Store the bottle in its
proper compartment, away from sources
of heat. The sealant fluid has an expiry
date. Replace the bottle containing
out-of-date sealant fluid.

WARNING

55) In the event of a puncture caused by
foreign bodies, the kit may be used to
repair tyres showing damages on the tread
or shoulder up to max. 4 mm diameter.

140

WARNING

3) Dispose of the bottle and the sealant
properly. Dispose of the components
in compliance with national and local
regulations.

Do not use flexible ropes when towing, and
avoid jerky movements. While towing,
make sure that the trailer hitch does not
damage any components it is touching.
When towing the vehicle, you must comply
with all specific traffic regulations and
adopt an appropriate driving behaviour. Do
not start the engine while towing the
vehicle. Before tightening the ring, clean
the threaded housing thoroughly. Make
sure that the ring is fully fastened in the
housing before towing the vehicle.

163) The front and rear tow hooks should
be used only for emergencies on the road.
You are allowed to tow the vehicle for
short distances using an appropriate
device in accordance with the highway
code (a rigid bar), to move the vehicle on
the road in readiness for towing or
transport via a breakdown vehicle. Tow
hooks MUST NOT be used to tow vehicles
off the road or where there are obstacles
and/or for towing operations using ropes or
other non-rigid devices. Respecting the
above conditions, towing must take place
with two vehicles (one towing, the other
towed) aligned as much as possible along
the same centre line.

BROKEN-DOWN
VEHICLE TOWING

It is recommended to tow the vehicle
with all four wheels lifted from the
ground on the platform of a rescue
vehicle.
VERSIONS WITH FOUR-WHEEL
DRIVE (4WD) AND AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION
IMPORTANT Avoid lifting the front (or
rear) wheels only. Lifting the front (or
rear) wheels only while towing might
damage the transmission or the transfer
unit.
IMPORTANT If a vehicle is towed
without complying with the above
requirements, the transmission and/or
the transfer unit might be seriously
damaged. Damage due to an incorrect
towing will not be covered by the
warranty.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

Correct maintenance permits the
performance of the vehicle to be
maintained over time, as well as limited
running costs and safeguarding the
efficiency of the safety systems.

SCHEDULED
SERVICING

Correct servicing is crucial for
guaranteeing a long life for the vehicle
under the best conditions. For this
reason, Jeep has planned a series of
checks and services at fixed distance
intervals and, where provided, at fixed
time intervals, as described in the
Scheduled Servicing Plan.
Before each service, it is always
necessary to carefully follow the
instructions in the Scheduled Servicing
Plan (e.g. periodically check level of
fluids, tyre pressure, etc.).
Scheduled Servicing is offered by all
Jeep Dealerships according to a set
time schedule. If, during each
operation, in addition to the ones
scheduled, the need arises for further
replacements or repairs, these may
be carried out with your explicit
agreement only. If your vehicle is used
frequently for towing, the interval
between one service operation and the
next should be reduced.

IMPORTANT Scheduled Servicing
Coupons are required by the
Manufacturer. Failure to have them
carried out may invalidate the warranty.
It is advisable to inform a Jeep
Dealership of any small operating
irregularities without waiting for the next
service.
PERIODIC CHECKS
Every 1,000 km or before long
journeys, check and if necessary, top
up: engine coolant level; brake fluid
level; screen washer fluid level; tyre
inflation pressure and condition; lighting
system operation (headlights, direction
indicators, hazard warning lights, etc.);
screen washer/wiper system operation
and positioning/wear of windscreen/
rear window wiper blades.
Every 3,000 km, check and top up if
required: engine oil level.
HEAVY-DUTY USE OF THE
VEHICLE
If the vehicle is used under one of the
following conditions: towing a trailer
or caravan; dusty roads; short (less
than 7-8 km), repeated journeys with
sub-zero outside temperatures; engine
often idling or driving long distances
at low speed or long periods of
inactivity, the following checks must be
carried out more often than indicated
in the Scheduled Servicing Plan:

❒ check front disc brake pad condition
and wear;
❒ check cleanliness of bonnet and
luggage compartment locks,
cleanliness and lubrication of linkage;
❒ visually inspect condition of: engine,
gearbox, transmission, pipes and hoses
(exhaust/fuel system/brakes) and
rubber elements (boots/sleeves/
bushes, etc.);
❒ check battery charge and battery
fluid level (electrolyte);
❒ visually inspect condition of the
accessory drive belts;
❒ check and, if necessary, change
engine oil and replace oil filter;
❒ check and, if necessary, replace
pollen filter;
❒ check and, if necessary, replace air
cleaner.
On versions with automatic
transmission, change transmission oil
and replace oil filter every 60,000 km
(40,000) or every 4 years.

WARNING

164) Never smoke when performing
operations in the engine compartment.
Flammable gases and fumes may be
present and risk igniting.
165) Be very careful when working in the
engine compartment when the engine
is hot: you may get burned.
166) If the engine oil is being topped up,
wait for the engine to cool down before
loosening the filler plug, particularly for
vehicles with aluminium plug (where
provided). CAUTION: risk of burns!
167) The cooling system is pressurised. If
necessary, only replace the cap with
another original one or the operation of the
system may be adversely affected. Do
not remove the reservoir cap when the
engine is hot: risk of burns.
168) Do not travel with the windscreen
washer reservoir empty: the windscreen
washer is essential for improving visibility.
Repeated operation of the system without
fluid could damage or cause rapid
deterioration of some system components.
169) Certain commercial additives for
windscreen washer fluids are inflammable.
The engine compartment contains hot
components which may set it on fire.
170) Brake fluid is poisonous and highly
corrosive. In the event of accidental
contact, immediately wash the affected
parts with water and mild soap. Then rinse
thoroughly. Call a doctor immediately if
swallowed.

symbol on the container

171) The
indicates a synthetic brake fluid, which is
different from a mineral fluid. Using a
mineral fluid will damage the special rubber
seals of the braking system beyond repair.
172) Battery fluid is poisonous and
corrosive. Avoid contact with the skin and
eyes. Keep open flames away from the
battery and do not use objects that might
create sparks: risk of explosion and fire.
173) Using the battery with insufficient
fluid irreparably damages the battery and
may cause an explosion.
174) If the vehicle must remain unused for
a long time at a very low temperature,
remove the battery and take it to a warm
place, to avoid freezing.
175) When performing any operation on
the battery or near it, always protect your
eyes with special goggles.

61) PARAFLU UP anti-freeze fluid is used in
the engine cooling system; use the same
fluid type as that already in the cooling
system when topping up. PARAFLU UP
may not be mixed with other types of
anti-freeze fluids. In the event of topping up
with an unsuitable product, under no
circumstances start the engine and contact
a Jeep Dealership.
62) Avoid allowing brake fluid, which is
extremely corrosive, to come into contact
with painted areas. Should it happen, wash
immediately with water.
63) Incorrect assembly of electrical and
electronic accessories may cause severe
damage to your vehicle. Go to a Jeep
Dealership if you want to install accessories
(e.g. anti-theft, radio phone, etc.): they will
suggest the most suitable devices and
advise you whether a higher capacity
battery needs to be installed.

WARNING

WARNING

58) Be careful not to confuse the various
types of fluids while topping up: they
are not compatible with each other!
Topping up with an unsuitable fluid could
severely damage your vehicle.
59) The oil level should never exceed the
MAX mark.
60) Do not add oil with specifications other
than those of the oil already in the engine.

4) Used engine oil and oil filters contain
substances which are harmful to the
environment. You are advised to contact a
Jeep Dealership to have the oil and filters
changed.
5) Used transmission fluid contains
substances that are harmful to the
environment. It is advisable to contact a
Jeep Dealership for oil changes.
6) Batteries contain substances which are
very dangerous for the environment. For
battery replacement, contact a Jeep
Dealership.

the driver side door, wait at least one
minute before disconnecting the
electrical supply from the battery. When
reconnecting the electrical supply to
the battery, make sure that the ignition
device is in the STOP position and
the driver side door is closed.

IMPORTANT Charging should be slow
at a low ampere rating for
approximately 24 hours. Charging for a
longer time may damage the battery.

VERSIONS WITH
STOP/START SYSTEM
To recharge, proceed as follows:
❒ disconnect the connector A fig. 151
(pressing the button B) from the sensor
C monitoring the battery conditions,
on the negative pole (–) D of the
battery;
❒ connect the positive cable (+) of the
battery charger to the positive battery
terminal E and the negative cable (–) to
sensor terminal D as shown;
❒ turn on the battery charger. At the
end of the charging process, switch the
battery charger off;
❒ after having disconnected the
charger, reconnect connector A to the
sensor C as in fig. 151.

IMPORTANT The cables of the
electrical system must be correctly
reconnected to the battery, i.e. the
positive cable (+) to the positive
terminal and the negative cable (–) to
the negative terminal. The battery
terminals are marked with the positive
(+) and negative (–) symbols, and are
shown on the battery cover. The battery
terminals must also be corrosion-free
and firmly secured to the terminals. If a
"quick-type" battery charger is used
with the battery fitted on the vehicle,
before connecting it disconnect both
cables of the battery itself. Do not use a
"quick-type" battery charger to provide
the starting voltage.
VERSIONS WITHOUT
STOP/START SYSTEM
To recharge, proceed as follows:
❒ disconnect the terminal from the
negative battery pole;
❒ connect the charger cables to the
battery terminals, observing the polarity;
❒ turn on the charger;

need to carry out repair or servicing
operations. Before starting the engine
make sure the system is not dismantled:
failure to comply with this precaution
may cause serious injuries.
177) Exhaust emissions are very
dangerous and may be fatal. They contain
carbon monoxide, a colourless and
odourless gas which, if inhaled, may cause
fainting and poisoning.
178) The exhaust system can reach high
temperatures and cause a fire if the vehicle
is parked on flammable material. Dry grass
or leaves can also catch fire if they come
into contact with the exhaust system.
Do not park or use the vehicle in a place in
which the exhaust system might come
into contact with flammable material.

WARNING

64) Incorrect maintenance of the vehicle or
failure to carry out operations or repairs
(when necessary) may lead to more
expensive repairs, damage to other
components or a negative impact on the
vehicle performance. Have any operating
faults immediately checked by a Jeep
Dealership.
65) The vehicle is equipped with fluids
optimised for protecting its performance
and duration, and to extend servicing
intervals. Do not use chemicals for washing
these components since they may
damage the engine, the gearbox or the
climate control system. This damage is not
covered by the vehicle’s warranty. If, due
to malfunction of a component, washing is
needed, only use the fluid specific for
that procedure.
66) An excessive or insufficient amount of
oil in the block is extremely harmful for
the engine. Make sure it is always at an
adequate level.
67) Always require the use of only
compressor coolants and lubricants
approved and suitable for the specific air
conditioning system fitted on the vehicle.
Some non-approved coolants are
flammable and may explode, with the risk
of injuries. The use of non-approved
coolants or lubricants may adversely affect
system efficiency, leading to expensive
repairs.

68) The air conditioning system contains
high-pressure coolant: to prevent damage
to people or the system, any topping-up
with fuel or repairs that involves
disconnection of the pipes must be carried
out by a Jeep Dealership.
69) Vehicles equipped with a catalytic
converter must be exclusively supplied with
unleaded petrol. Leaded petrol would
permanently damage the catalytic
converter and eliminate its ability to reduce
polluting emissions, seriously
compromising the engine performance,
which would be irreparably damaged. If the
engine does not work correctly, especially
if it starts irregularly or if there is a reduction
of its performance, immediately go to a
Jeep Dealership. Prolonged and faulty
operation of the engine may cause
overheating of the converter and, as a
consequence, possible damage to the
converter and the vehicle.
70) Using a gearbox fluid different from that
approved may compromise gearshifting
quality and/or cause vibration of the
gearbox itself.
71) It is recommended to have the vehicle
serviced by a Jeep Dealership. When
carrying out normal periodic operations
and small servicing interventions personally
on the vehicle, it is recommended to use
suitable equipment, original spare parts
and the necessary fluids. Do not carry out
any interventions if you don't have the
necessary experience.

162

LIFTING THE
VEHICLE

WHEELS AND TYRES

If the vehicle is to be lifted, go to a Jeep
Dealership which is equipped with the
arm lift or workshop lift.

SUGGESTIONS ABOUT
THE ROTATION OF THE
TYRES

179)

72) 73) 74) 75)

The front and rear tyres are subject to
different loads and stress due to
steering, manoeuvres and braking. For
this reason they are subject to uneven
wear.
To resolve this problem, tyres should be
rotated at the appropriate time. This
operation is recommended for tyres
with a deep tread pattern, suitable both
for on-road and off-road driving.
Tyre rotation contributes to the
preservation of the grip and traction
performance on wet, muddy or snowy
roads, guaranteeing optimal driveability
of the vehicle.
In the case of irregular wear of the
tyres, the reason must be identified and
corrected before rotating them.

WARNING

72) Road holding depends also on the
correct tyre inflating pressure.
73) If the pressure is too low the tyre
overheats and this can cause it serious
damage.
74) Do not cross switch the tyres, moving
them from the right of the vehicle to the left
and vice versa.
75) Never submit alloy rims to repainting
treatments requiring the use of
temperatures exceeding 150°C. The
mechanical properties of the wheels could
be impaired.

WARNING

179) Do not cross switch the tyres if they
are "unidirectional" type. In this case,
always take care not to fit the tyres with a
direction of rotation that is opposite to that
indicated: you would risk losing grip and
control of the vehicle.

BODYWORK
PRESERVING THE
BODYWORK
Paintwork
Touch up abrasions and scratches
immediately to prevent the formation of
rust.
Some parts of the vehicle are painted
with a matte paintwork which requires
special care for its preservation
77)
To correctly wash the vehicle, follow
these instructions:
❒ is the vehicle is washed remove the
aerial from the roof;
❒ if high pressure jets or cleaners are
used to wash the vehicle, keep a
distance of at least 40 cm from the
bodywork to avoid damage or
alteration. Build up of water could
cause damage to the vehicle in the long
term.

WARNING

WARNING

7) Detergents cause water pollution. Only
wash your vehicle in areas equipped to
collect and treat wastewater from this type
of activity.

76) In order to preserve the aesthetic
appearance of the paint abrasive products
and/or polishes should not be used for
cleaning the vehicle.
77) Avoid washing with rollers and/or
brushes in washing stations. Wash the
vehicle only by hand using neutral pH
detergents; dry it with a wet chamois
leather. Abrasive products and/or polishes
should not be used for cleaning the vehicle.
Bird droppings must be washed off
immediately and thoroughly as the acid
they contain is particularly aggressive.
Avoid (if at all possible) parking the vehicle
under trees; remove vegetable resins
immediately as, when dried, it may only be
possible to remove them with abrasive
products and/or polishes, which is highly
inadvisable as they could alter the typical
opaqueness of the paint. Do not use pure
screen washer fluid for cleaning the
windscreen and rear window; dilute it min.
50% with water. Only use pure screen
washer fluid when strictly necessary due to
outside temperature conditions.

(*) After using the spare wheel in an emergency, where necessary, align the pressure of the wheel to the recommended value as soon as possible, with reference to

the following table.
SNOW CHAINS
Front- and all-wheel drive versions: 7-mm snow chains can be used on 215/65 R16 tyres. Chains cannot be fitted on
215/60 R17 and 225/55 R18 tyres.
Important
The use of snow chains should be in compliance with local regulations of each country. In certain countries, tyres marked with
code M+S (Mud and Snow) are considered as winter equipment; therefore their use is equivalent to that of the snow chains.
The snow chains may be applied only to the front wheel tyres.
Check the tension of the snow chains after the first few metres have been driven.
Using snow chains with tyres with non-original dimensions may damage the vehicle.
Using different size or type (M+S, snow, etc.) tyres between front and rear axle may adversely affect vehicle driveability, with the
risk of losing control of the vehicle and resulting accidents.

78) Keep your speed down when snow chains are fitted; do not exceed 50 km/h. Avoid potholes, steps and pavements and avoid driving for
long distances on roads not covered with snow to prevent damaging the vehicle and the road surface.

"Minimum ground clearance" (reference A fig. 158)
The clearance value is measured next to the lower edge of the differential. This value also defines those for the "Approach
angle" the "Departure angle" and the "Breakover angle".
Dimensions are expressed in mm and refer to the vehicle equipped with its standard-supplied tyres.
Front wheel drive (FWD) versions: 171 mm
Four wheel drive (4WD) versions: 201 mm
Trailhawk versions with four wheel drive (4WD LOW): 225 mm

172

"Approach angle" (reference B fig. 158)
The approach angle is determined by the horizontal line of the road surface and by the tangent line passing between the front
wheel and the most projecting low point of the vehicle.
The wider the angle, the lower the chance to hit an obstacle with the body or chassis, climbing a steep slope or overcoming an
obstacle.
Front wheel drive (FWD) versions: 17.9°
Four wheel drive (4WD) versions: 21°
Trailhawk versions with four wheel drive (4WD LOW): 30.5°

"Departure angle" (reference C fig. 158)
The departure angle is determined by the same lines of the "Approach angle", and refers to the rear part of the vehicle.
Front wheel drive (FWD) versions: 29.7°
Four wheel drive (4WD) versions: 32.1°
Trailhawk versions with four wheel drive (4WD LOW): 34.3°

"Breakover angle" (reference D fig. 158)
The value of the "Breakover angle" is linked to the ground clearance of the vehicle and indicates the attitude of the vehicle to
overcome a wedge, more or less steep, preventing the vehicle from resting on the ground with the body or chassis after
touching the wedge with its lowest and most projecting parts (usually the underbody), this would highly reduce wheel grip.
The wheels, without a suitable grip to the ground, will not have sufficient hold to move the vehicle, and will surge.
The higher the ground clearance, the wider the breakover angle. Always bear in mind that the higher the ground clearance, the
lower the stability, due to a higher centre of gravity which reduces the side tipping angle.
Front wheel drive (FWD) versions: 21.2°
Four wheel drive (4WD) versions: 24°
Trailhawk versions with four wheel drive (4WD LOW): 25.7°

PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HANDLING THE VEHICLE AT THE END OF
ITS LIFE

Jeep has been committed for many years to safeguarding the environment through the constant improvement of its production
processes and manufacturing products that are increasingly "eco-compatible". To assure customers of the best possible
service in terms of respecting environmental laws and in response to European Directive 2000/53/EC governing vehicles at the
end of their life, Jeep is offering their customers the opportunity of handing over their vehicle (*) at the end of its life without
incurring any additional costs.
The European Directive sets out that when the vehicle is handed over the last keeper or owner should not incur any expenses
as a result of it having a zero or negative market value. In particular, in almost all European Union countries, until 1st January
2007, vehicles registered after 1st July 2002 will be collected free of charge, whilst from 2007 collection will be free of charge
irrespective of the year of registration as long as the vehicle contains its basic components (in particular, the engine and
bodywork) and has no additional waste.
To hand your vehicle over at the end of its life without extra cost, go to one of our Dealerships or Jeep-authorised collection
and scrapping centres. These centres have been carefully chosen to offer high quality service for the collection, treatment and
recycling of vehicles at their end of life, respecting the surrounding environment. You can find further information on these
collection and scrapping centres either from a Jeep Dealership or by calling the freephone number 00 800 0 426 5337 or on
the Jeep website.
(*) Vehicle for transporting passengers with a maximum of nine seats and a total permitted weight of 3.5 t.

TIPS, CONTROLS
AND GENERAL
INFORMATION
ROAD SAFETY
Learn how to use the various system
functions before setting off.
Read the instructions for the system
carefully before setting off.

182) 183)

RECEPTION CONDITIONS
Reception conditions change
constantly while driving. Reception may
be interfered with by the presence of
mountains, buildings or bridges,
especially when you are far away from
the broadcaster.

IMPORTANT The volume may be
increased when receiving traffic alerts
and news.

CARE AND MAINTENANCE
Observe the following precautions
to ensure the system is fully
operational:
❒ the display lens should not come into
contact with pointed or rigid objects
which could damage its surface; use a
soft, dry anti-static cloth to clean and
do not press.
❒ never use alcohol, petrols and
derivatives to clean the display lens.

❒ prevent any liquid from entering the
system: this could damage it beyond
repair.

80) 81)

ANTI-THEFT
PROTECTION
The system is equipped with an
anti-theft protection system based on
the exchange of information with the
electronic control unit (Body Computer)
on the vehicle.
This guarantees maximum safety and
prevents the secret code from being
entered after the power supply has
been disconnected.
If the check has a positive outcome, the
system will start to operate, whereas if
the comparison codes are not the
same or if the electronic control unit
(Body Computer) is replaced, the
system will ask the user to enter the
secret code according to the procedure
described in the paragraph below.

Entering the secret code
(excluding versions equipped with
Uconnect 6.5" Radionav)
When the system is switched on, if the
code is requested, the display will
show "Please enter Anti-Theft Code"
followed by the video page showing
a keypad to enter the secret code.

The secret code is made up of four
digits, from 0 to 9: to insert the first digit
of the code, turn the BROWSE/ENTER
right knob and press to confirm.
After entering the fourth digit, the
system begins operating.
If an incorrect code is entered, the
system displays "Incorrect Code" to
notify the user of the need to enter the
correct code.
After the 3 available attempts to enter
the code, the system displays
"Incorrect Code. Radio locked. Wait for
30 minutes". Once the text has
disappeared you can start the code
entering procedure again.

Vehicle radio passport
(excluding versions equipped with
Uconnect 6.5" Radionav)
This document certifies ownership of
the system. The vehicle radio passport
shows the system model, serial number
and secret code.
In the case of loss of the vehicle radio
passport, contact the Jeep Dealership,
taking an ID document and the vehicle
ownership documents.

IMPORTANT Keep the vehicle radio
passport in a safe place so that you
can give the information to the relevant
authorities if the system is stolen.

IMPORTANT
In the event of a fault, the system must
only be checked and repaired by a
Jeep Dealership.
If the temperature is particularly low, the
display may take a while to reach
optimum brightness.
If the vehicle is stopped for a while and
the external temperature is very high,
the system may go into “thermal
protection” mode, suspending
operation until the radio temperature
returns to acceptable levels.
Look at the screen only when it is
necessary and safe. If you need to look
at the screen for a long time, pull over
to a safe place so as not to be
distracted while driving.
Immediately stop using the system in
the event of a fault. Otherwise the
system might be damaged. Contact a
Jeep Dealership as soon as possible to
have the system repaired.

WARNING

182) Follow the safety rules below;
otherwise serious injuries may occur to the
occupants or the system may be
damaged.
183) If the volume is too loud this can be
dangerous. Adjust the volume so that
you can still hear background noises (e.g.
horns, ambulances, police vehicles, etc.).

WARNING

80) Only clean the front panel and the
display with a soft, clean, dry, anti-static
cloth. Cleaning and polishing products
may damage the surface. Do not use
alcohol or similar products to clean the
panel or the display.
81) Do not use the display as a base for
supports with suction pads or adhesives
for external navigators or smartphones
or similar devices.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

WARNING

MySky SUN ROOF
❒ While refitting the panels, pay special attention to prevent any trapping of fingers, scarves, ties and loose clothing; they might be trapped
under the panels themselves.
ROOF RACK/SKI RACK
❒ Before driving, make sure that the transversal bars have been fitted properly.
SUGGESTIONS FOR DRIVING
❒ If the engine stalls, the vehicle skids or it is not possible to drive in a straight line on the top of a hill or a road with a gradient, do not try to
do a U-turn for any reason. This operation would result in the vehicle rolling over. Back up on the stretch of road with a gradient, shifting to
reverse and proceeding with the utmost care. Do not travel downhill with gearbox in neutral and using only the brake.
❒ The presence of abrasive material on the brakes may cause excessive wear or adversely affect its correct operation. If the vehicle is driven
in particularly dusty environments, have the brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.
INTERIORS
❒ Never use flammable products, such as petrol ether or rectified petrol to clean the inside of the vehicle. The electrostatic charges which are
generated by rubbing during the cleaning operation may cause a fire.
❒ Do not keep aerosol cans in the vehicle: danger of explosion. Aerosol cans must not be exposed to a temperature exceeding 50°C. When
the vehicle is exposed to sunlight, the internal temperature can greatly exceed this value.
❒ There must be no obstacles on the floor underneath the pedals; make sure that mats are always flat and do not interfere with the pedals.
SUPPLY
❒ Modifications or repairs to the supply system that are not carried out correctly or do not take the system technical specifications into
account can cause malfunctions leading to the risk of fire.

WARNING

ROOF RACK/SKI RACK
❒ The use of transversal bars on longitudinal ones prevents the use of the sunroof, because the latter, while opening, interferes with the bars.
❒ Therefore do not move the sunroof if transversal bars have been fitted.
❒ Fully comply with the regulations in force concerning maximum clearance.
INTERIORS
❒ Never use alcohol, petrols and derivatives to clean the dashboard and instrument panel lens.
