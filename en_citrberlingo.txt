Environment
With you, CITROËN acts to protect 
the environment.
We invite you to visit the  
www.citroen.co.uk website.

As the driver, you also can contribute 
to protecting the environment in the 
following way:
-  drive smoothly, without frequent 

and harsh acceleration,

-  observe the service intervals; 

we recommend that services are 
carried out by a CITROËN dealer, 
authorised to collect used batteries 
and fluids,
in order to preserve the reliability 
of the engine and emission control 
systems, do not use engine oil 
additives.

- 

Refer to information on eco-driving at 
the end of this section.

2ECO-DRIVINGMotoring & the EnvironmentEco-driving

1

6 Eco-driving is a range of everyday 
practices that allow the motorist to 
optimise their fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions.

Optimise the use of your 
gearbox
With a manual gearbox, move off 
gently and change up without waiting. 
During acceleration change up early.

With an automatic or electronic 
gearbox, give preference to automatic 
mode and avoid pressing the 
accelerator pedal heavily or suddenly.

The gear efficiency indicator invites 
you to engage the most suitable gear: 
as soon as the indication is displayed 
in the instrument panel, follow it 
straight away.
For vehicles fitted with an electronic 
or automatic gearbox, this indicator 
appears only in manual mode.

Drive smoothly
Maintain a safe distance between 
vehicles, use engine braking rather 
than the brake pedal, and press the 
accelerator progressively. These 
practices contribute towards a 
reduction in fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions and also help to reduce 
the background traffic noise.

If your vehicle has cruise control, make 
use of the system at speeds above 
25 mph (40 km/h) when the traffic is 
flowing well.

Control the use of your 
electrical equipment
Before moving off, if the passenger 
compartment is too warm, ventilate it 
by opening the windows and air vents 
before using the air conditioning.
Above 30 mph (50 km/h), close the 
windows and leave the air vents open.
Remember to make use of equipment 
that can help keep the temperature 
in the passenger compartment down 
(sunroof and window blinds...).
Switch off the air conditioning, unless 
it has automatic regulation, as soon as 
the desired temperature is attained.

Switch off the demisting and 
defrosting controls, if not automatic.
Switch off the heated seat as soon as 
possible.

Switch off the headlamps and front 
foglamps when the level of light does 
not require their use.

Avoid running the engine before 
moving off, particularly in winter; your 
vehicle will warm up much faster 
while driving.

As a passenger, if you avoid 
connecting your multimedia devices 
(film, music, video game...), you 
will contribute towards limiting the 
consumption of electrical energy, and 
so of fuel.
Disconnect your portable devices 
before leaving the vehicle.

Motoring & the EnvironmentLimit the causes of excess 
consumption

Observe the recommendations 
on maintenance

Spread loads throughout the vehicle; 
place the heaviest items in the bottom 
of the boot, as close as possible to 
the rear seats.
Limit the loads carried in the 
vehicle and reduce wind resistance 
(roof bars, roof rack, bicycle 
carrier, trailer...). Use a roof box in 
preference.
Remove roof bars and roof racks 
after use.

Check the tyre pressures regularly, 
when cold, referring to the label in the 
door aperture, driver's side.
Carry out this check in particular:
-  before a long journey,
-  at each change of season,
-  after a long period out of use.
Don't forget the spare wheel and the 
tyres on any trailer or caravan.

7
1

When refuelling, do not continue after 
the third cut-off of the nozzle to avoid 
any overflow.

At the wheel of your new vehicle, 
it is only after the first 1 800 miles 
(3 000 kilometres) that you will see 
the fuel consumption settle down to a 
consistent average.

At the end of winter, remove snow 
tyres and refit your summer tyres.

Have your vehicle serviced regularly 
(engine oil, oil filter, air filter, passenger 
compartment filter...) and observe the 
schedule of operations recommended 
in the manufacturer's service schedule.

With a BlueHDi Diesel engine, if the 
SCR system is faulty your vehicle 
becomes polluting; go to a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop without 
delay to have the emissions of nitrogen 
oxides brought back to the legal level.

KEY
This locks and unlocks the vehicle's 
doors, opens and closes the fuel filler 
cap, as well as starting and stopping 
the engine.

Unlocking the load space

Press this button to unlock all 
of the rear doors.

REMOTE CONTROL
Unlocking the cab or the vehicle

Security of use
To unlock the load space only:

Press this button once to 
unlock the front doors.
Press this button again 
to unlock your vehicle 
completely.

The direction indicators flash twice.

Press this control to lock the 
vehicle completely.

Press this control to unlock 
the load space, the front 
doors alone remain locked.

Locking

Press this button to lock the 
vehicle completely.

The direction indicators flash once.
If one of the doors is open 
(transportation of long loads) or is not 
closed correctly, the central locking will 
not work.

Deadlocking
A second press on the closed padlock 
on the remote control within five 
seconds after locking changes the 
locking to deadlocking.
This is confirmed by fixed lighting 
of the direction indicators for 
approximately two seconds.
Deadlocking renders the exterior 
and interior door opening handles 
inoperative: do not leave anyone inside 
the vehicle when it is deadlocked.
If deadlocking is activated from inside 
the vehicle using the remote control, it 
will change to normal locking when the 
vehicle is started.

AccessUnfolding / folding

If you do not press the button, 
the mechanism of the key 
may be damaged.

Good practice
Take care not to allow the remote 
control to come into contact with 
grease, dust, rain or a damp 
environment.
A heavy object attached to the key 
(key ring, ...) weighing on the shaft 
of the key in the switch, may cause a 
malfunction.

Battery ref.: CR1620 / 3 volts.
The "battery flat" information is given 
by an audible signal, accompanied by 
a message in the screen.
To replace the battery, unclip the 
casing using a coin at the ring.
If the remote control does not work 
after the battery has been changed, 
reinitialise the remote control.
There is a risk of damage if the 
replacement battery is not the correct 
type.

Use only identical batteries or 
batteries of an equivalent type to those 
recommended by CITROËN dealers.
Do not discard the remote control 
batteries, they contain metals which 
are harmful to the environment.
Deposit them at a CITROËN 
dealership, or at an authorised 
collection point.

Reinitialising the remote  
control
Following changing of the remote 
control battery or disconnection of the 
vehicle battery, the remote control may 
have to be reinitialised.
Wait at least one minute before using 
the remote control.

the buttons (padlocks) of the remote 
control facing you.
Switch on the ignition.
Press the locking padlock for at 
least five seconds within the next

ELECTRONIC IMMOBILISER
All of the keys contain an electronic 
immobiliser device.
This device locks the engine supply 
system. It is activated automatically 
when the key is removed from the 
ignition.
After the ignition is switched on, a 
dialogue is established between the 
key and the electronic immobiliser 
system.
The metal part of the key must be 
unfolded correctly for correct dialogue 
to take place.
If you lose your keys
Visit a CITROËN dealer with the 
vehicle's V5 registration certificate and 
your identification document.
A CITROËN dealer will be able 
to retrieve the key code and 
the transponder code so that a 
replacement key can be ordered.

Good practice
Do not make any modifications to the 
electronic immobiliser system.
Operating the remote control, even 
when it is in your pocket, may result in 
involuntary unlocking of the doors.
The simultaneous use of other 
high frequency equipment (mobile 
telephones, domestic alarms…), may 
interfere with the operation of the 
remote control temporarily.
The remote control does not operate 
while the key is in the ignition, even if 
the ignition is off.

When purchasing a second-hand 
vehicle, have the keys memorised by 
a CITROËN dealer, so as to be sure 
that the keys in your possession are 
the only ones that can be used to start 
the vehicle.

Don't forget
When leaving the vehicle, check that 
the lighting is off and nothing of value 
is visible.
As a safety precaution (with children 
on board), remove the key from the 
ignition when leaving the vehicle, even 
for a short time.

ALARM
If fitted on your vehicle, this provides 
two types of protection:
-  exterior protection: it sounds if a 

- 

front/rear door or the bonnet is 
opened.
interior protection: it sounds if 
the volume inside the passenger 
compartment changes (breaking of 
a window or a movement inside the 
vehicle).

If your vehicle is fitted with a separation 
partition, the interior protection is not 
active in the load space.
Locking the vehicle with 
complete alarm
Setting the alarm
-  Switch off the ignition and get out of 

the vehicle.

-  Set the alarm within five minutes of 
getting out of the vehicle, by locking 
or deadlocking using the remote 
control. The red LED, located in the 
button, flashes once per second.

AccessDisarming
-  Unlock the vehicle with the remote 
control or switch on the ignition, the 
red LED goes off.

Locking the vehicle with 
exterior protection only
If, while you are away from the vehicle, 
you wish to leave a window partially 
open or a pet inside the vehicle,  
you should choose exterior protection 
only.
-  Switch off the ignition.

- 

In the next ten seconds, 
press the button until 
the red LED is on 
continuously.
-  Get out of the vehicle.
-  Within the next five minutes, set 

the alarm by locking or deadlocking 
using the remote control (the red 
LED flashes once a second).

Triggering
The siren sounds, the direction indicators 
flash for approximately 30 seconds and 
the red LED flashes rapidly.
-  To switch it off, insert the key and 

switch on the ignition.

When the alarm has been triggered ten 
times in succession (when triggered 
for the eleventh time) it is deactivated. 
Repeat the procedure for setting the 
alarm.

FRONT DOORS
From the outside
Use the remote control to lock/unlock 
the vehicle.
Insert the metal part of the key in the 
lock on the driver's side if the remote 
control does not work.

Locking the vehicle without 
alarm
- 

Insert the key in the lock on the 
driver's door and lock it.

Do not set the alarm when washing 
your vehicle.
Failure of the remote control
When the alarm is set but the remote 
control does not operate:
-  Unlock the doors with the key and 

open the door. The alarm is triggered.

-  Switch on the ignition in the 

next ten seconds. The alarm is 
disarmed.

Incorrect operation
When the ignition is switched on, if the 
red LED remains on for ten seconds, 
there is a fault in the siren connection.
Contact a CITROËN dealer to have the 
system checked.
Automatic setting of the alarm
Depending on the country in which 
the vehicle is sold, the alarm is set 
automatically approximately 2 minutes 
after the last door is closed.
To prevent triggering of the alarm when 
a door is opened, you have to press 
the remote control unlocking button 
again.

Do not make any modifications 
to the alarm system as this could 
cause faults.

enters the red zone:
Reduce your speed or let the engine 
run at idle.
What you should do if the warning 
lamp comes on:
-  stop immediately, switch off the 

ignition. The fan may continue to 
operate for a certain time, up to 
approximately 10 minutes,

-  wait for the engine to cool down in 

order to check the coolant level and 
top it up if necessary.

As the cooling system is pressurised, 
follow the procedure below to avoid the 
risk of scalding:
-  wait at least one hour after 

switching off the engine before 
carrying out any work,

-  unscrew the cap by 1/4 turn to 

allow the pressure to drop,

-  when the pressure has dropped, 

check the level in the header tank,
if necessary, remove the cap to top up.

- 
If the needle remains in the red 
zone, have the system checked by 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

Refer to chapter 7, "Levels" 
section.

Instruments and controlsEMISSIONS CONTROLS

UNDER-INFLATION DETECTION

EOBD (European On Board 
Diagnosis) is a diagnostics 
system which complies with, 
among others, the standards 
on emissions limits of:

-  CO (carbon monoxide),
-  HC (unburnt hydrocarbons),
-  NOx (nitrogen oxides), detected 

by oxygen sensors placed 
downstream of the catalytic 
converters,

-  particles.

The driver is warned of any 
malfunction of this emissions 
control system by the illumination 
of this warning lamp in the instrument 
panel.
If this warning lamp comes on, have 
it checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

This system continuously 
monitors the pressures of 
the four tyres, as soon as 
the vehicle is moving.

A pressure sensor is located in the 
valve of each tyre (except the spare 
wheel).
The system triggers an alert if a drop 
in pressure is detected in one or more 
tyres.

1
4

This system does not avoid the 
need to check the tyre pressures 
regularly (including the spare 
wheel) and before a long journey.
Driving with under-inflated tyres 
adversely affects road holding, 
extends braking distances and causes 
premature tyre wear, particularly under 
arduous conditions (vehicle loaded, 
high speed, long journey).

Driving with under-inflated tyres 
increases fuel consumption.

The tyre under-inflation detection 
system is an aid to driving which 
does not replace the need for 
vigilance on the part of the driver.

The tyre pressures for your vehicle 
can be found on the tyre pressure 
label.

Refer to chapter 9, "Identification 
markings" section.

The tyre pressures must be checked 
when the tyres cold (vehicle stopped 
for 1 hour or after driving for less then 
6 miles (10 km) at moderate speed).
Otherwise, add 0.3 bar to the values 
indicated on the label.

READY TO GO3Instruments and controls2

Under-inflation alert

The alert is given by the fixed 
illumination of this warning lamp, 
accompanied by an audible signal, 
and depending on equipment, the 
display of a message.

 The loss of pressure detected 
does not always lead to visible 
deformation of the tyre. Do not rely 
on just a visual check.

The alert is maintained until 
the tyre or tyres concerned is 
reinflated, repaired or replaced.
The spare wheel (space-saver 
type or a steel rim) does not have a 
sensor.

In the event of a problem on one of 
the tyres, the symbol or the message 
appears, according to equipment, to 
identify it.
-  Reduce speed, avoid sudden 

steering movements or harsh brake 
applications.

-  Stop as soon as it is safe to do so.
- 

In the event of a puncture, use 
the temporary puncture repair kit 
or the spare wheel (according to 
equipment),
or
if you have a compressor, the one 
in the temporary puncture repair 
kit for example, check the four tyre 
pressures when cold,
or
if it is not possible to check the 
tyre pressures at the time, drive 
carefully at reduced speed.

Operating fault

The flashing and then 
fixed illumination of the 
under-inflation warning 
lamp accompanied by the 

illumination of the "Service" warning 
lamp, and depending on equipment, 
the display of a message indicates a 
fault with the system.
In this case, monitoring of the tyre 
pressures is not assured.

 This alert is also displayed when 
one or more wheels is not fitted 
with a sensor (for example, a 
space-saver or steel spare wheel).

Go to a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked 
or, following the repair of a puncture, to 
have the original wheel, equipped with 
a sensor, refitted.

Instruments and controlsSERVICE INDICATOR
This programmes service intervals 
according to the use of the vehicle.

Operation
A few moments after the ignition 
has been switched on, the spanner 
indicating a service operation comes 
on; the display for the total distance 
recorder gives (in round figures) the 
distance remaining before the next 
service.
The points at which a service is due 
are calculated from the last indicator 
zero reset.
The point at which a service is due is 
determined by two parameters:
- 
- 

the distance travelled,
the time which has elapsed since 
the last service.

The distance remaining before the 
next service may be weighted by 
the time factor, depending on the 
type of driving.

More than 1 000 miles/km before the 
next service is due
Example: 4 800 miles/km remain 
before the next service is due. When 
the ignition is switched on and for a 
few seconds, the screen shows:

A few seconds after the ignition is 
switched on, the oil level is displayed 
(depending on version), then the total 
distance recorder resumes normal 
operation and the spanner remains on. 
This indicates that a service should be 
carried out shortly.

A few seconds after the ignition is 
switched on, the oil level is displayed 
(depending on version), then the total 
distance recorder resumes normal 
operation showing the total and trip 
distances.

Less than 1 000 miles/km before the 
next service is due
Each time the ignition is switched on and for a few 
seconds, the spanner flashes and the number of 
miles/kilometres remaining is displayed:

Service overdue

Each time the ignition 
is switched on and for a 
few seconds, the spanner 
flashes and the excess 
distance is displayed.

With the engine running the spanner 
remains on until the service has been 
carried out.
For BlueHDi Diesel versions, this 
alert is also accompanied by the fixed 
illumination of the Service warning 
lamp, on switching on the ignition.

For BlueHDi Diesel versions, the 
spanner can also come on early, 
according the level of deterioration 

of the engine oil. Deterioration of the 
engine oil depends on the conditions of 
use of the vehicle.

Zero reset
Your CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop carries out this operation 
after each service.
However, if you carry out the service 
yourself, the re-set procedure is as 
follows:
-  switch off the ignition,
-  press and hold the trip recorder 

reset button,

-  switch on the ignition.
The display begins a countdown.
When the display shows "=0", release 
the button; the spanner disappears.

After this operation, if you wish 
to disconnect the battery, lock 
the vehicle and wait for at least 

five minutes, otherwise the zero re-set 
will not be registered.

Engine oil level indicator
Depending on your vehicle's engine, 
when the ignition is switched on, 
the engine oil level is indicated for 
a few seconds, after the service 
information.

Oil level correct

Low oil level
Flashing of "OIL", 
linked with the 
service warning lamp, 
accompanied by an 
audible signal and a message in the 
screen, indicates a low oil level which 
could damage the engine.
If the low oil level is confirmed by a 
check using the dipstick, it is essential 
that the level is topped up.

Oil level gauge  
fault
Flashing of "OIL--" 
indicates a malfunction 
of the engine oil level 
indicator. Contact a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop.

The level read will only be correct 
if the vehicle is on level ground 
and the engine has been off for 
more than 30 minutes.

Dipstick
A = maximum, never exceed 
this level as a surplus of oil 
may damage the engine.
Contact a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop 
without delay.
B = minimum, top up the level 
via the oil filler cap, using the 
grade of oil suited to your 
engine.

When driving, avoid leaving your hand 
on the gear knob as the force exerted, 
even if slight, may wear the internal 
components of the gearbox over time.

In the 6-speed configuration, raise the 
collar below the gear knob.

The lever should be moved slowly 
to reduce noise.

To engage reverse gear, wait until the 
vehicle has come to a complete stop.

GEAR SHIFT INDICATOR

System which reduces fuel 
consumption by recommending the 
most appropriate gear.

With an electronic gearbox, the system 
is only active in manual mode.

Depending on the driving situation and 
your vehicle's equipment, the system 
may advise you to skip one (or more) 
gear(s). You can follow this instruction 
without engaging the intermediate 
gears.
The gear engagement 
recommendations must not be 
considered compulsory. This is 
because the configuration of the road, 
the traffic density and safety remain 
determining factors when choosing the 
best gear. Therefore, the driver remains 
responsible for deciding whether or not 
to follow the indications given.
This function cannot be deactivated.

The information appears 
in the instrument panel 
in the form of an arrow. It 
may be accompanied by a 
recommended gear.

The system adapts its gear 
change recommendation 
according to the driving conditions 

(slope, load, ...) and the demands 
of the driver (power, acceleration, 
braking, ...).
The system never suggests:
-  engaging first gear,
-  engaging reverse gear.

Changing to automatic 
mode

Move the gear selector to A.
The gearbox then operates in

Manual mode

Changing to manual mode

Move the gear selector to M.

Pull on the "+" control 
paddle to change up.
Pull on the "-" control 
paddle to change down.

If the vehicle stops or reduces 
speed (for example when 
approaching a stop sign), 
the gearbox changes down 
automatically, to first gear if 
needed.
It is not necessary to release the 
accelerator completely during gear 
changes.

-  A gear change instruction is 

accepted only if the engine speed 
permits.

-  For safety reasons, depending on 
the engine speed, a change down 
may be performed automatically.

Acceleration
For optimum acceleration (e.g. to 
overtake another vehicle), simply 
press the pedal beyond the point of 
resistance at the end of its travel, by 
pressing down firmly.

Vehicle stationary, with the 
engine running
In the event of a prolonged stop with 
the engine running, the gearbox 
changes automatically to neutral N.

Stopping the vehicle
Before stopping the engine, put the 
gear selector in position N.
In all cases, it is essential to apply 
the parking brake. Check that the 
parking brake warning lamp is on in the 
instrument panel.

In situations of high engine speeds 
(heavy acceleration), a change 
up will not occur unless the driver 
operates the electronic gearbox control 
paddle.

Before doing anything in the 
engine compartment, check that 
the gear selector is in neutral N.

Gearbox and steering wheelSTOP & START
The Stop & Start system puts the 
engine temporarily on standby - STOP 
mode - during stops in the traffic (red 
lights, traffic jams, or other...).
The engine restarts automatically - 
START mode - as soon as you want to 
move off.
The restart takes place instantly, 
quickly and silently.
Perfect for urban use, the Stop & Start 
system reduces fuel consumption and 
exhaust emissions as well as the noise 
level when stationary.

If your vehicle is fitted with the system, 
a time counter calculates the sum of 
the periods in STOP mode during a 
journey. It rests itself to zero every time 
the ignition is switched on with the key.

With a 6-speed electronic 
gearbox, for your comfort during 
parking manoeuvres, STOP mode 
is not available for a few seconds after 
coming out of reverse gear.
STOP mode does not affect the 
functionality of the vehicle, such as 
braking, power steering, for example.

Operation

Going into engine STOP mode

The "ECO" warning lamp 
comes on in the instrument 
panel and the engine goes 
into standby:

Never refuel with the engine in 
STOP mode; you must switch off 
the ignition with the key.

-  with a manual gearbox, at speeds 
below 12 mph (20 km/h), when you 
put the gear lever into neutral and 
release the clutch pedal,

-  with a 6-speed electronic

DRIVING RECOMMENDATIONS

Observe the driving regulations and 
remain vigilant whatever the traffic 
conditions.
Pay close attention to the traffic and 
keep your hands on the wheel so that 
you are ready to react at any time to 
any eventuality.
As a safety precaution, the driver 
must only carry out actions requiring 
sustained attention when the vehicle is 
stationary.
On a long journey, a break every two 
hours is strongly recommended.
In difficult weather, drive smoothly, 
anticipate the need to brake and 
increase the distance from other 
vehicles.

Driving on flooded roads
We strongly advise against driving 
on flooded roads, as this could cause 
serious damage to the engine or 
gearbox, as well as to the electrical 
systems of your vehicle.

If you are obliged to drive through 
water:

Important!

Never drive with the parking brake 
applied - Risk of overheating and 
damage to the braking system!

Risk of fire!
As the exhaust system of your vehicle 
is very hot, even several minutes after 
switching off the engine, do not park 
or leave the engine running over areas 
where inflammable substances and 
materials are present: grass, leaves, 
etc.

Never leave a vehicle 
unsupervised with the engine 
running. If you have to leave 

your vehicle with the engine running, 
apply the parking brake and put the 
gearbox into neutral or position N or P, 
depending on the type of gearbox.

-  check that the depth of water does 
not exceed 15 cm, taking account 
of waves that might be generated 
by other users,

-  deactivate the Stop & Start system,
-  drive as slowly as possible without 
stalling. In all cases, do not exceed 
6 mph (10 km/h),

-  do not stop and do not switch off 

the engine.

On leaving the flooded road, as soon 
as circumstances allow, make several 
light brake applications to dry the brake 
discs and pads.
If in doubt on the state of your vehicle, 
contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

When the range falls below 20 miles 
(30 km), dashes are displayed. After 
filling with at least 10 litres of fuel, the 
range is recalculated and is displayed 
when it exceeds 60 miles (100 km).
If, whilst driving, dashes are displayed 
continuously in place of the digits, 
contact a CITROËN dealer.

Current fuel consumption: only 
calculated and displayed above 
20 mph (30 km/h).

Average fuel consumption: this is the 
average fuel consumption since the 
last trip computer zero reset.

Distance travelled: calculated since 
the last trip computer zero reset.

Distance remaining to the 
destination: calculated with reference to 
the final destination, entered by the user. 
If guidance is activated, the navigation 
system calculates it as a current value.

Good practice
When changing the programmed 
speed setting by means of a 
maintained press, pay attention as 
the speed can increase or decrease 
rapidly.
Do not use the cruise control on 
slippery roads or in heavy traffic.
In the event of a steep slope, the cruise 
control cannot prevent the vehicle from 
exceeding the programmed speed 
setting.
In any event, the cruise control cannot 
replace the need to observe the speed 
limits and the need for vigilance on the 
part of the driver.
It is advisable to keep your feet near 
the pedals.
To avoid any jamming under the 
pedals:
-  ensure that the mat and its fixings 

on the floor are positioned correctly,

-  never place one mat on top of 

another.

Changing  
the programmed 
speed

There are two methods of memorising 
a speed higher than the previous one:

Without using the accelerator
-  Press the SET + button.
A brief press increases the speed by 1 mph (km/h).
A maintained press increases the 
speed in steps of 5 mph (km/h).

Switching the system off
-  Place the dial in position 0 or 

switch off the ignition to switch 
everything off.

Cancelling the programmed 
speed setting
When the vehicle becomes stationary, 
after switching off the ignition, the 
system no longer memorises a speed.

Using the accelerator
-  Exceed the memorised speed until 

the speed required is reached,

-  Press the SET + or SET - button.

To memorise a speed lower than the 
previous one:
-  Press the SET - button.

Air conditioning
In all seasons, the air conditioning 
should only be used with the 
windows closed. However, if the 
interior temperature remains high 
after a prolonged period parked in 
the sun, first ventilate the passenger 
compartment for a few minutes.
Use the AUTO mode as much as 
possible as it permits optimised 
control of all of the functions: air flow, 
passenger compartment comfort 
temperature, air distribution, air 
intake mode or air recirculation in the 
passenger compartment.
Operate the air conditioning system for 
5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a month, 
to keep it in good working order.
If the system does not produce cold air, 
do not use it and contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

It is normal that the condensation 
created by the air conditioning system 
results in a flow of water which may 
form a puddle under the vehicle when 
parked.

CREW CAB

Bench seat
The crew cab consists of a 3-seat 
bench, located in row 2, the one-piece 
back of which is in unit with the "load 
retainer" grille.
Access to the rear seats is via the 
sliding side door.

Placing in the fully folded position
If necessary, move the front seats 
- 
forward and fasten the strap of the 
seat belt of the centre seat.

-  Check that the seat belt straps and 

buckles are positioned correctly 
along the side panels, to ensure 
that the sliding of the seat backrest 
is not hindered.

-  Release the seat backrest using 

the control A.

Practical informationHead restraints and seat belts
The three seats are equipped with 
inertia reel seat belts. The seat belts 
of the outer seats are secured to the 
body, whereas the seat belt of the 
centre seat is secured to the backrest 
of the bench seat.
Each seat has a head restraint bolted 
onto the load retaining grille and which 
can be removed.

Do not store a head restraint inside 
the vehicle unless it is properly 
stowed or fixed to a support.

Do not drive with rear passengers 
without first bolting the head restraints 
in place.

Good practice
There is no need to assist, guide or 
support the tilting movement using 
your free arm.
The rear seat belt casings are not 
designed for securing the load 
transported. Use the stowing rings on 
the floor only.
The bench seat of the crew cab is not 
suitable for the installation of a child 
seat.

-  Using the same hand, fold the seat 

backrest and the associated grille 
onto the seat cushion.

-  Take hold of the red strap (like 
a handle) and lift the assembly 
vertically, guiding the movement to 
the fully folded position.

The raised seat rests against the 
backrests of the seats of row 1.

Returning to the seat position
- 

In a single movement: take hold of 
the red strap and pull the assembly 
horizontally towards the rear.

  Guide the movement until the feet 
of the bench seat lock on the floor.

-  Raise the seat backrest.

Labels are applied at various 
points on your vehicle. They 
carry safety warnings as well as 
vehicle identification information. Do 
not remove them: they form an integral 
part of your vehicle.

For any work on your vehicle, use 
a qualified workshop that has the 
technical information, skills and 

equipment required, all of which a 
CITROËN dealer is able to provide.

We draw your attention to the 
following points:

-  The fitting of electrical equipment 

or accessories not listed by 
CITROËN may cause excessive 
current consumption and faults and 
failures with the electrical system of 
your vehicle. Contact a CITROËN 
dealer for information on the range 
of recommended accessories.

-  As a safety measure, access to 
the diagnostic socket, used for 
the vehicle's electronic systems, 
is reserved strictly for CITROËN 
dealers or qualified workshops, 
equipped with the special tools 
required (risk of malfunctions of the 
vehicle's electronic systems that 
could cause breakdowns or serious 
accidents). The manufacturer 
cannot be held responsible if this 
advice is not followed.

-  Any modification or adaptation 
not intended or authorised by 
Automobiles CITROËN or carried 
out without meeting the technical 
requirements defined by the 
manufacturer would lead to the 
suspension of the legal and 
contractual warranties.

Installation of accessory  
radio communication 
transmitters

Before installing a radio communication 
transmitter, you must contact a 
CITROËN dealer for the specification 
of transmitters which can be fitted 
(frequency, maximum power, 
aerial position, specific installation 
requirements), in line with the Vehicle 
Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive 
(2004/104/EC).

Depending on the legislation in 
force in the country, certain safety 
equipment may be compulsory: 

high visibility safety vests, warning 
triangles, breathalysers, spare bulbs, 
spare fuses, fire extinguisher, first 
aid kit, mud flaps at the rear of the 
vehicle...

HAZARD WARNING LAMPS
Press this button, the direction 
indicators flash.
They can operate with the ignition off.
The hazard warning lamps should only 
be used in dangerous situations, when 
stopping in an emergency or when 
driving in unusual conditions.

Automatic operation of hazard 
warning lamps
When braking in an emergency, 
depending on the force of deceleration, 
the hazard warning lamps come 
on automatically. They switch off 
automatically the first time you 
accelerate.
It is also possible to switch them off by 
pressing the switch on the dashboard.

HORN
Press the centre of the steering wheel.

PARKING BRAKE
Applying
Pull the parking brake lever up to 
immobilise your vehicle.
Check that the parking brake is applied 
firmly before leaving the vehicle.

If the parking brake is still on or has 
not been released properly, this is 
indicated by this warning lamp which 
comes on in the instrument panel.

When parking on a slope, direct your 
wheels towards the pavement and pull 
the parking brake lever up.
There is no advantage in engaging 
a gear after parking the vehicle, 
particularly if the vehicle is loaded.

Pull on the parking brake lever, only 
with the vehicle stationary.
In the exceptional case of use of the 
parking brake when the vehicle is 
moving, apply the brake by pulling 
gently to avoid locking the rear wheels 
(risk of skidding).

PARKING SENSORS

The audible (front and rear) and visual 
(rear) parking sensor system consists 
of proximity sensors, installed in the 
rear bumper.
The sensors detect any obstacle which 
enters its field of operation: person, 
vehicle, tree, fence, behind the vehicle 
during the manoeuvre.
Certain objects detected at the 
beginning of the manoeuvre will no 
longer be detected at the end of the 
manoeuvre due to the blind spots 
between and below the sensors.
Examples: stake, roadworks cone or 
pavement post.

Engage reverse gear
An audible signal confirms the 
activation of the system by engaging 
reverse gear.
The proximity information is indicated 
by an audible signal which becomes 
more rapid as the vehicle approaches 
the obstacle.
When the distance between the rear 
of the vehicle and the obstacle is less 
than approximately thirty centimetres, 
the audible signal becomes 
continuous.

Display in the screen

Good practice
In bad weather or in winter, ensure that 
the sensors are not covered with mud, 
ice or snow.
The system will be deactivated 
automatically if a trailer is being towed 
or if a bicycle carrier is fitted (vehicle 
fitted with a towbar or bicycle carrier 
recommended by CITROËN).

The parking sensor system 
cannot, in any circumstances, 
take the place of the vigilance and 
responsibility of the driver.

You are advised to deactivate 
the system if your vehicle is fitted 
with a rear ladder or if you are 
transporting a load which exceeds 
the length of the vehicle.

Activation / Deactivation

You can activate or deactivate 
the system by pressing this 
button.
The activation or deactivation 
of the system is stored when 
the vehicle stops.

Engage forward gear

In addition to the rear parking sensors, 
the front parking sensors are triggered 
when an obstacle is detected in 
front of the vehicle and the speed 
of the vehicle remains below 6 mph 
(10 km/h).

The tone from the speaker (front 
or rear) allows an obstacle to be 
identified as either in front of or 
behind the vehicle.

Stop the assistance
Change to neutral.

EMERGENCY BRAKING 
ASSISTANCE (EBA)
In an emergency, this system enables 
the optimum braking pressure to be 
reached more quickly, press the pedal 
firmly without releasing it.
It is triggered by the speed at which the 
brake pedal is pressed down.
This alters the resistance of the brake 
pedal under your foot.
To maintain operation of the 
emergency braking assistance system: 
keep your foot on the brake pedal.

ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM 
(ABS / EBFD)
The ABS and EBFD (electronic brake 
force distribution) systems improve the 
stability and manoeuvrability of your 
vehicle on braking, in particular on 
poor or slippery surfaces.
The ABS prevents locking of the 
wheels, the EBFD provides control of 
the braking pressure wheel by wheel.

Good practice
The anti-lock braking system comes 
into operation automatically when 
there is a risk of wheel lock. It does not 
reduce the braking distance.
On very slippery surfaces (ice, oil, 
etc...) the ABS may increase the 
braking distance. When braking in 
an emergency, do not hesitate to 
press the brake pedal firmly, without 
releasing the pressure, even on a 
slippery surface, you will then be able 
to continue to manoeuvre the vehicle 
to avoid an obstacle.
Normal operation of the ABS may be 
felt by slight vibration of the brake 
pedal.
When changing wheels (tyres and 
rims), ensure that these are listed by 
CITROËN for the vehicle.

ABS

If this warning lamp comes 
on, accompanied by an 
audible signal and a message 
in the screen, it indicates a 
malfunction of the ABS which 

could result in a loss of control of the 
vehicle on braking.

ABS

If this warning lamp comes 
on, together with the brake 
and STOP warning lamps, 
accompanied by an audible 
signal and a message in the 

screen, it indicates a malfunction of 
the electronic brake force distribution 
which could result in a loss of control of 
the vehicle on braking.

Stop as soon as it is safe to do so.
In both cases, contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

Driving safelySAFETY56
9

ANTI-SLIP REGULATION (ASR) 
AND DYNAMIC STABILITY 
CONTROL (DSC)
These systems are linked and 
complement the ABS.
The ASR system is very useful for 
maintaining optimum drive and 
avoiding losses of control of the vehicle 
on acceleration.
The system optimises drive to prevent 
the wheels skidding, by acting on the 
brakes of the drive wheels and on the 
engine. It also allows the directional 
stability of the vehicle to be improved 
on acceleration.
Use the DSC to hold your course 
without attempting to countersteer.
If there is a variation between the 
trajectory followed by the vehicle and 
that required by the driver, the DSC 
system automatically acts on the 
engine and the brake of one or more 
wheels, in order to put the vehicle back 
on course.

Operation

Operating fault

The warning lamp flashes 
when operation of the ASR or 
DSC is triggered.

Deactivation
In certain exceptional conditions 
(starting the vehicle when stuck in mud 
or snow, or on loose ground...), it could 
prove useful to deactivate the ASR and 
DSC systems to make the wheels spin 
and regain grip.

-  Press the button or turn 
the dial to the DSC OFF 
position (depending on 
model).

-  The LED comes on: the ASR and 
DSC systems no longer come into 
play.

They engage again:
-  automatically above 30 mph  

(50 km/h),

-  manually by pressing the 
button again or by turning 
the dial to this position 
(depending on model).

 When a malfunction of the 
systems occurs, the warning 
lamp and the LED come on, 
accompanied by an audible 
signal and a message in the 
screen.

Contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop to have the system 
checked.
The warning lamp may also come on if 
the tyres are under-inflated. Check the 
pressure of each tyre.

Good practice
The ASR/DSC systems offer increased 
safety during normal driving, but 
should not incite the driver to take risks 
or to drive at high speed.
The operation of these systems is 
ensured if the recommendations 
of the manufacturer regarding 
the wheels (tyres and rims), the 
braking components, the electronic 
components and the fitting and repair 
procedures are observed.
After an impact, have these systems 
checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

Driving safely7

GRIP CONTROL
On snow, mud or sand, traction control 
is obtained by a compromise between 
safety, grip, traction and appropriate 
tyres.

It adapts to allows most conditions of 
poor grip to be accommodated.
The accelerator pedal must be pressed 
enough for there to be adequate 
engine power to manage the various 
parameters in the best way.

Correct use
Your vehicle is designed principally to 
drive on tarmac roads but it allows you 
to drive on other less passable terrain 
occasionally.
However, particularly when your 
vehicle is heavily laden, it does not 
permit off-road activities such as:
-  crossing and driving on ground 

which could damage the underbody 
or tear off components (fuel pipe, 
fuel cooler, ...), particularly by 
obstacles or stones,

-  driving on ground with steep 

gradients and poor grip,

-  crossing a stream.

Driving safelySAFETY5Different modes are available:

8
9

Normal (ESC)

Snow

Sand

This mode is calibrated  
for a low level of skidding, 
based on different conditions 
of grip encountered on the 
road.

When the ignition is switched off,  
the system returns automatically to 
DSC mode.

This mode allows the vehicle 
to adapts its strategy to the 
conditions of grip encountered 
for each of the two front 
wheels, on moving off.

When moving, the system optimises 
wheelspin to provide the best 
acceleration possible for the grip 
available.

This mode allows a little 
wheelspin on the two driving 
wheels at the same time to 
allow the vehicle to move 
forward and reduces the risk 
of getting stuck in the sand.
Do not use the other modes on sand 
as the vehicle may become stuck.

ESC OFF

This mode is only suitable 
for specific conditions 
encountered when moving  
off or at low speed.
Above 30 mph (50 km/h) 

the system returns to DSC mode 
automatically.

Off road
(mud, wet grass, ...)

 When moving off, this 
mode allows considerable 
wheelspin on the wheel 
with the least grip to favour 
clearing of the mud and 
regain "grip".

At the same time, the wheel with the 
most grip is controlled in such a way as 
to transmit as much torque as possible.
When moving, the system optimises 
wheelspin to meet the driver's 
requirements as fully as possible.

Conditions for activation
Active City Brake only operates if the 
following conditions are met:
ignition on,
● 
the vehicle is in a forward gear,
● 
●  speed is between about 3 and  

18 mph (5 and 30 km/h),
the braking assistance systems 
(ABS, EBFD, emergency braking 
assistance) are not faulty,

● 

● 
● 

Principle
Using a laser sensor located at the top 
of the windscreen, this system detects 
a vehicle running in the same direction 
or stationary ahead of your vehicle.
When necessary, the vehicle's braking 
system is operated automatically 
to avoid a collision with the vehicle 
ahead.

Automatic braking occurs later 
than if done by the driver, so as 
to intervene only when there is a 
high risk of collision.

Never look at the laser sensor 
through an optical instrument 
(magnifying glass, microscope...) 
at a distance of less than 
10 centimetres: risk of eye injury.

ACTIVE CITY BRAKE

Active City Brake is a driving 
assistance system that aims to avoid 
a frontal collision or reduce the speed 
of an impact if the driver does not 
react sufficiently (inadequate brake 
application).

This system is designed to improve 
driving safety.
It remains the driver's responsibility 
to continuously monitor the state of 

the traffic and to assess the distances 
and relative speeds of other vehicles.
Active City Brake can in no 
circumstances replace the need for 
vigilance on the part of the driver.

Driving safelySAFETY50

1

Operation
When your vehicle is too close to or 
approaches the vehicle ahead too 
quickly the system automatically 
applies the brakes to avoid a collision.
You are then alerted by the display of a 
message.
The brake lamps on your vehicle come 
on to warn other road users.

The collision can be avoided 
automatically if the difference in speed 
between your vehicle and the vehicle 
ahead does not exceed 9 mph  
(15 km/h).
Above this threshold, the system will 
do what is possible to avoid or reduce 
the accident by lowering the speed of 
impact.
The automatic braking may bring 
the vehicle to a complete stop if the 
situation requires it.
In this case, the vehicle is held 
stationary temporarily (for about  
1.5 seconds) to allow the driver to take 
back control by pressing the brake 
pedal.

The triggering of the system may 
cause the engine to stall, unless 
the driver depresses the clutch 
pedal quickly enough during 
automatic braking.

During automatic braking, the 
driver can always obtain a higher 
rate of deceleration than that 

controlled by the system, by pressing 
firmly on the brake pedal.

Operating limits
The system only detects vehicles that 
are stationary or moving in the same 
direction as your vehicle.

It does not detect small vehicles 
(bicycles, motorcycles), 
pedestrians or animals, nor non-
reflective stationary objects.

The system is not triggered or is 
interrupted if the driver:
-  accelerates strongly
-  or turns the steering wheel 

suddenly (avoiding manoeuvre).

After an impact, the system is 
automatically put out of service: it 
no longer operates.

You must go to a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop to have the system 
made operational again.

In difficult weather conditions (very 
heavy rain, snow, fog, hail...), 
braking distances increase, which 
can reduce the ability of the system to 
avoid a collision.
The driver must therefore remain 
particularly vigilant.

Never leave accumulations of 
snow or any object projecting 
above the bonnet or in front of 

the roof: this might fall into the field of 
vision of the sensor and generate a 
detection.

After folding or moving a seat or a rear 
bench seat, ensure that the seat belt 
has reeled in correctly and that the 
buckle is ready to accommodate the 
tongue.
Depending on the nature and 
seriousness of any impact, the 
pretensioning device may be deployed 
before and independently of inflation 
of the airbags. It instantly tightens 
the seat belts against the body of the 
occupants.
Deployment of the pretensioners is 
accompanied by a slight discharge 
of harmless smoke and a noise, due 
to the activation of the pyrotechnic 
cartridge incorporated in the system.
The force limiter reduces the pressure 
of the seat belt against the body of the 
occupants.
The pretensioning seat belts are active 
when the ignition is switched on.

SEAT BELTS
Height adjustment
Squeeze the control with the return and 
slide the assembly on the driver's seat 
side and on the individual passenger 
seat side.
The height of the seat belt for the 
centre seat of the front bench cannot 
be adjusted.

Fastening
Pull the strap, then insert the tongue 
into the buckle.
Check that the seat belt is fastened 
correctly by pulling the strap.

Unfastening
Press the red button.

Seat belt(s) not fastened 
warning lamp

When the vehicle is started, 
this warning lamp comes on 
if a user at the front has not 
fastened their seat belt.

Good practice
The driver must ensure that 
passengers use the seat belts correctly 
and that they are all strapped in 
securely before moving off.

SAFETY5Seat belts4

The inertia reels are fitted with a device 
which automatically locks the strap in 
the event of a collision or emergency 
braking or if the vehicle rolls over.
You can unfasten the seat belt by 
pressing the red button on the buckle. 
Guide the seat belt after unfastening.
The airbag warning lamp comes on 
if the pretensioners are deployed. 
Contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

In order to be effective, a seat belt:
-  must restrain one person only,
-  must not be twisted, check by 

pulling in front of you with an even 
movement,

-  must be tightened as close to the 

body as possible.

The upper part of the seat belt should 
be positioned in the hollow of the 
shoulder.
The lap part should be placed as low 
as possible on the pelvis.
Do not interchange the seat belt 
buckles as they will not fulfil their role 
properly. If the seats are fitted with 
armrests, the lap part of the seat belt 
should always pass under the armrest.
Check that the seat belt is fastened 
correctly by pulling the strap firmly.

Recommendations for children:
-  use a suitable child seat if the 

passenger is less than 12 years old 
or shorter than one metre fifty,
-  never allow a child to travel on 

your lap, even with the seat belt 
fastened.

Front seat belts
The front seats are fitted with 
pretensioners and force limiters.
The seat belt associated with the 
centre seat of the front bench does not 
have a pretensioner.

For more information on child 
seats, refer to the "Child safety" 
section of chapter 5.

In accordance with current safety 
regulations, your CITROËN dealer can 
guarantee all work or any checks, from 
testing to maintenance, on your seat 
belt equipment.
Have the seat belts checked regularly 
(even after a minor impact) by a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop: they must not show any 
signs of wear, cutting or fraying 
and they must not be converted or 
modified.

Clean the seat belt straps with 
soapy water or a textile cleaning 
product, sold by CITROËN 
dealers.

AIRBAGS

General information
The airbags have been designed to 
maximise the safety of the occupants 
in the event of a serious collision; 
they work in conjunction with the force 
limiting seat belts.

In the event of a serious collision, the 
electronic detectors record and analyse 
the front and side impacts suffered in 
the impact detection zones:
- 

in the event of a serious impact, 
the airbags inflate instantly and 
contribute towards better protecting 
the occupants of the vehicle; 
immediately after the impact, the 
airbags deflate rapidly, so that they 
do not hinder the visibility of the 
occupants nor their possible exit 
from the vehicle.

- 

in the event of a minor or rear 
impact and in certain roll-over 
conditions, the airbags will not be 
deployed; the seat belt alone is 
sufficient to contribute towards your 
protection in these situations.
The seriousness of the collision 
depends on the nature of the obstacle 
and the speed of the vehicle at the 
moment of impact.

SAFETY5Airbags6
0
1

Airbags only operate when the 
ignition is switched on.

This equipment only operates once. 
If a second impact occurs (during the 
same or a subsequent accident), the 
airbag will not operate.
The deployment of an airbag or airbags 
is accompanied by a slight discharge 
of smoke and a noise, due to the 
activation of the pyrotechnic cartridge 
incorporated in the system.
This smoke is not harmful, but 
sensitive individuals may experience 
some irritation.
The noise of the detonation may result 
in a slight loss of hearing for a short 
time.

The passenger's front airbag must 
be deactivated if a child seat is 
installed rearward facing.
Chapter 5, "Child safety" section.

Advice
Sit in a normal upright position.
Wear a correctly adjusted seat belt.
Do not allow anything to come between 
the occupants and the airbags (a child, 
pet, object...), do not attach or fix 
anything near to the airbags or their 
trajectories when inflating as this could 
cause injuries when the airbags are 
deployed.
Never modify the original definition of 
your vehicle, particularly in the area 
directly around the airbags.
After an accident or if the vehicle has 
been stolen or broken into, have the 
airbag systems checked.
All work on the airbag system must be 
carried out by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
Even if all of the precautions 
mentioned are observed, a risk of 
injury or of minor burns to the head, 
chest or arms when an airbag is 
deployed cannot be ruled out. The bag 
inflates almost instantly (within a few 
milliseconds) then deflates within the 
same time discharging the hot gas via 
openings provided for this purpose.

Front airbags
Do not drive holding the steering wheel 
by its spokes or resting your hands on 
the centre part of the wheel.
Passengers must not place their feet 
on the dashboard.
Do not smoke as deployment of the 
airbags can cause burns or the risk of 
injury from a cigarette or pipe.
Never remove or pierce the steering 
wheel or hit it violently.
Do not fit or attach anything to the 
steering wheel or dashboard, this could 
cause injuries with deployment of the 
airbags.

Lateral airbags
Use only approved covers on the 
seats, compatible with the deployment 
the lateral airbags. For information 
on the range of seat covers suitable 
for your vehicle, you can contact a 
CITROËN dealer.
For more information on accessories, 
refer to "Other accessories" in 
section 6.
Do not fix or attach anything to the seat 
backs (clothing...). This could cause 
injury to the chest or arms if the lateral 
airbag is deployed.
Do not sit with the upper part of the 
body any nearer to the door than 
necessary.

dealer or a qualified workshop to have 
the system checked. The airbags may 
no longer be deployed in the event of a 
serious impact.

Impact detection zones
A.  Front impact zone.
B.  Side impact zone.

In the event of a minor impact or 
bump on the side of the vehicle or 
if the vehicle rolls over, the airbag 
may not be deployed.

Lateral airbags
This is a system which protects the 
driver and front passenger in the event 
of a serious side impact in order to limit 
the risk of injury to the chest.
Each lateral airbag is fitted in the front 
seat backrest frame, on the door side.

Deployment
It is deployed unilaterally in the event 
of a serious side impact applied to 
all or part of the side impact zone B, 
perpendicular to the longitudinal 
centreline of the vehicle on a horizontal 
plane and directed from the outside 
towards the inside of the vehicle.
The lateral airbag inflates between the 
front occupant of the vehicle and the 
corresponding door trim panel.

Front airbags
The front airbags are fitted in the 
centre of the steering wheel for the 
driver and in the dashboard for the 
front passenger(s).

Deployment
They are deployed, except the 
passenger's front airbag if it has been 
deactivated, in the event of a serious 
front impact applied to all or part of the 
front impact zone A in the longitudinal 
centreline of the vehicle on a horizontal 
plane directed from the front towards 
the rear of the vehicle.
The front airbag inflates between the 
front occupant of the vehicle and the 
dashboard to cushion their forward 
movement.

Deactivating the passengers front 
airbag
Only the passenger's front airbag can 
be deactivated.
-  With the ignition switched off, 
insert the key into the passenger's 
front airbag deactivation switch.

-  Turn it to the "OFF" position.
-  Remove the key keeping the switch 

in the new position.

The passenger's front airbag 
warning lamp in the instrument 
panel remains on while the 
airbag is deactivated.

To ensure the safety of your child, 
it is essential to deactivate the 
passenger's front airbag when you 

install a rearward facing child seat on 
the front passenger seat. Otherwise, 
the child would risk being killed or 
seriously injured if the airbag were 
deployed.

Reactivation
In the "OFF" position, the passenger's 
front airbag will not be deployed in the 
event of an impact.
As soon as the child seat is removed, 
turn the passenger's front airbag switch 
to the "ON" position to reactivate the 
airbag and thus ensure the safety 
of your passenger in the event of an 
impact.

Child safetyADVICE ON CHILD SEATS

The incorrect installation of a child seat 
in a vehicle compromises the child's 
protection in the event of an accident.
Check that there is no seat belt or seat 
belt buckle under the child seat, as this 
could destabilise the seat.
Remember to fasten the seat belts or 
the child seat harnesses keeping the 
slack relative to the child's body to a 
minimum, even for short journeys.
For the installation of a child seat using 
the seat belt, ensure that the seat belt 
is well tensioned on the child seat 
and that it is holding the child seat 
firmly against the vehicle's seat. If the 
passenger seat is adjustable, move it 
forward if necessary.

At the rear, always leave sufficient 
space between the front seat and:
-  a rearward facing child seat,
- 

the feet of a child seated in a 
forward facing child seat.

For this, move the front seat forward 
and, if necessary, straighten its 
backrest as well.

For the optimum installation of a 
forward facing child seat, ensure that 
the back of the child seat is as close as 
possible to the backrest of the vehicle's 
seat, or in contact if possible.
The head restraint must be removed 
before installing a child seat with a 
backrest on the passenger seat.
Ensure that the head restraint is 
stowed or attached securely so that it 
is not thrown around the vehicle in the 
event of sharp braking.
Refit the head restraint as soon as the 
child seat is removed.

Children at the front
The legislation on carrying a child on 
the front passenger seat is specific to 
each country. Refer to the legislation in 
force in your country.
Deactivate the passenger's airbag 
when a rearward facing child seat is 
installed on the front seat.
Otherwise, the child would risk being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag 
were deployed.

Installing a booster seat
The chest part of the seat belt must 
be positioned on the child's shoulder 
without touching the neck.
Ensure that the lap part of the seat belt 
passes correctly over the child's thighs.
CITROËN recommends the use of a 
booster seat which has a back, fitted 
with a seat belt guide at shoulder level.

As a safety precaution, never leave:
-  one or more children alone and 

unsupervised in a vehicle,

-  a child or an animal in a vehicle 

which is exposed to the sun, with 
the windows closed,
the keys within reach of children 
inside the vehicle.

- 

To prevent accidental opening of the 
doors, use the "Child Lock".
Take care not to open the rear windows 
by more than one third.
To protect young children from the rays 
of the sun, fit side blinds to the rear 
windows.

TOWING A TRAILER, A CARAVAN...

For more information about 
weights and towed loads, refer to 
chapter 9, "Weights" section.

Driving advice
A towed vehicle must free wheel: 
gearbox in neutral.

Distribution of loads
Distribute the load in the trailer so 
that the heaviest objects are as 
close as possible to the axle and 
the nose weight is close to the 
maximum authorised without, however, 
exceeding it.
Cooling
Towing a trailer on a slope increases 
the coolant temperature.

As the fan is electrically controlled, its 
cooling capacity is not dependent on 
the engine speed.
You should therefore use a high gear 
to lower the engine speed and reduce 
your speed.
In all cases, pay attention to the 
coolant temperature.

Towing a trailerGood Practice
In certain cases of particularly arduous 
use (towing the maximum load up a 
steep slope in high temperatures), the 
engine automatically limits its power. 
In this case,  the air conditioning is 
automatically cut off to save engine 
power.

If the coolant temperature 
warning lamp comes on, stop 
the vehicle and switch off the 
engine as soon as possible.

Chapter 7, "Levels" section.

Tyres
Check the tyre pressures of the towing 
vehicle and of the trailer, observing the 
recommended pressures.

Chapter 9, "Identification 
markings" section.

Brakes
Towing increases the braking distance. 
Drive at a moderate speed, change 
down early and brake gradually.

Side wind
Sensitivity to side wind is increased. 
Drive smoothly and at a moderate 
speed.

ABS/DSC
The ABS or DSC systems only control 
the vehicle, not the trailer or caravan.

Parking sensors
The rear parking sensors system does 
not function while the vehicle is towing.

Towbar
We recommend the use of genuine 
CITROËN towbars and their wiring 
harnesses, which have been tested 
and approved from the design stage of 
your vehicle, and that you entrust the 
fitting of this equipment to a CITROËN 
dealer.
If this equipment is not fitted by a 
CITROËN dealer, it is imperative that 
it is fitted using the electrical pre-
equipment installed at the rear of the

manufacturer's instructions.
In accordance with the general 
instructions a reminder of which has 
been given above, we draw your 
attention to the risk associated with 
fitting a towbar or electrical accessory 
not recommended by CITROËN. 
Fitting such equipment could result in 
the failure of your vehicle's electronic 
system. Please obtain information from 
the Manufacturer before fitting this type 
of equipment.

These regular maintenance 
operations will keep your vehicle 
in good working order. Ask for 

advice from a CITROËN dealer or refer 
to the maintenance and warranty guide 
in the handbook pack.

If you have to remove / refit the 
engine style cover, handle it with 
care to avoid damaging the fixing clips.

Oil level
It is recommended that the oil level be 
checked every 3 000 miles (5 000 km) 
and topped up if necessary between oil 
changes.
Check the level with the vehicle level, 
engine cold, using the dipstick.

Dipstick

There are two marks on 
the dipstick:
A = maximum
If you fill past this mark, 
contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified 
workshop.
B = minimum
Never allow the level to 
fall below this mark.
To maintain the reliability 
of engines and emission 
control systems, the use 
of additives in engine oil 
is prohibited.

Oil change
This must be carried out at 
the intervals specified in the 
manufacturer's servicing schedule. Ask 
for advice from a CITROËN dealer.
Remove the dipstick before filling.
Check the level after filling (never 
exceed the max mark).
Refit the oil filler cap before closing the 
bonnet.

Changing the brake fluid
The brake fluid must be changed at 
the intervals stated, according to the 
manufacturer's servicing schedule.
Use fluids recommended by the 
manufacturer, which meet the 
DOT4 standard.
The level must be between the MIN 
and MAX marks on the reservoir.
If fluid has to be added frequently, 
this indicates a fault which must be 
checked by a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop as soon as 
possible.

Viscosity selection
In all cases, the oil selected must 
meet the requirements specified in the 
manufacturer's service schedule.

Warning lamps

Checks using the warning lamps in 
the instrument panel is described 
in chapter 3, "Instruments and 
controls" section.

LevelsCooling system
Only use the fluid recommended by the 
manufacturer.
Otherwise, you risk seriously damaging 
your engine.
When the engine is warm, the 
temperature of the coolant is controlled 
by the engine fan. As this fan can 
operate with the ignition key removed 
and because the cooling system is 
pressurised, wait for at least one hour 
after the engine has stopped before 
carrying out any work.
Slacken the cap by 1/4 of a turn to 
release the pressure to prevent any 
risk of scalding. When the pressure 
has dropped, remove the cap and top 
up the level with coolant.
If fluid has to be added frequently, 
this indicates a fault which must be 
checked by a CITROËN dealer as 
soon as possible.

Topping up
The level must be between the MIN 
and MAX marks on the expansion 
bottle. If more than 1 litre of fluid is 
required to top up the level, have the 
system checked by a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop.

Power steering fluid level
The vehicle must be parked on level 
ground with the engine cold. Unscrew 
the cap integrated with the gauge and 
check the level which must be between 
the MIN and MAX marks.

Screenwash level
For best quality cleaning and for your 
safety, we would advise that you use 
products of the CITROËN range.
For optimum cleaning and to avoid 
freezing, this fluid must not be topped 
up or replaced with plain water.
Capacity of the screenwash reservoir: 
approximately 3 litres.

In order to regenerate the filter, you 
are advised to drive at a speed higher 
than 40 mph (60 km/h) for at least five 
minutes as soon as possible, when 
traffic conditions permit (until the 
message disappears and the service 
warning lamp goes off).
During regeneration of the particle 
emission filter, the noise of a relay 
operating may be heard under the 
dashboard.
If the message is still displayed and 
if the service warning lamp remains 
on, contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

Topping up
This additive must be topped up by 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop without delay.

Diesel additive level 
(Diesel with particle 
filter)

The minimum level of this additive 
is indicated by lighting of the service 
warning lamp, accompanied by an 
audible signal and a message in the 
screen.
When this occurs with the engine 
running it is due to the start of 
saturation of the particle filter 
(exceptionally prolonged urban type 
driving conditions: low speed, long 
traffic jams, ...).

Waste products
Avoid prolonged contact of used oil 
with the skin.
Brake fluid is harmful to health and 
very corrosive.
Do not dispose of used oil, brake fluid 
or coolant into drains or into the ground 
but into the containers dedicated to this 
use at a CITROËN dealer (France) or 
an authorised waste disposal site.

CHECKS
Battery
At the start of summer or winter, have 
your battery checked by a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

Brake pads
Brake pad wear depends on the style 
of driving, in particular for vehicles 
which are used in town, over short 
distances. It may be necessary to 
check the thickness of the pads, even 
between services.
Unless there is a leak on the circuit, a 
drop in the brake fluid level indicates 
that the brake pads are worn.
Brake disc / drum wear
For information on checking the brake 
disc / drum wear, contact a CITROËN 
dealer.

Parking brake
Where the parking brake travel is too 
great or there is a reduction in the 
performance of the system, the parking 
brake should be adjusted, even 
between services.
Have the system checked by a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

Carbon filter and passenger 
compartment filter
An access flap allows replacement of 
the filters.
The carbon filter permits continuous 
and effective filtering of dust.
If the passenger compartment filter 
becomes blocked, this may reduce the 
performance of the air conditioning 
system and generate unpleasant 
odours.
We recommend the use of a combined 
passenger compartment filter. By 
means of its second special active 
filter, it contributes to the purification 
of the air breathed by the occupants 
and the cleanness of the passenger 
compartment (reduction of allergic 
symptoms, unpleasant odours and 
greasy deposits).

Refer to theservicing and warranty 
booklet for the replacement interval for 
these components.
Depending on the environment (dusty 
atmosphere...) and the use of the 
vehicle (urban driving...), change them 
twice as often if necessary.

ChecksOil filter
Change the filter regularly in 
accordance with the manufacturer's 
servicing schedule.

Particle filter (Diesel)
Maintenance of the particle filter must 
be carried out by a CITROËN dealer.
On acceleration after the vehicle has 
been running for a prolonged period 
at very low speed or at idle, you may, 
in exceptional circumstances, notice 
the emission of water vapour at the 
exhaust. This water vapour does not 
have any adverse effect on vehicle 
handling or the environment.

Bleeding water from the Diesel 
filter

If this warning lamp comes 
on, bleed the filter. Otherwise 
bleed regularly each time the 
engine oil is changed.

To drain the water, unscrew the bleed 
screw located on the filter.
Operate until all of the water no longer 
flows in the transparent pipe, then 
tighten the bleed screw.

Manual gearbox
Have the level checked in accordance with 
the manufacturer's servicing schedule.

Good practice
Only use products recommended by 
CITROËN or products of equivalent 
quality and specification.
In order to optimise the operation 
of units as important as the braking 
system, CITROËN selects and offers 
specific products.

HDi engines use advanced 
technology. All work requires 
special training, so should be 

entrusted to a CITROËN dealer.

Depending on country of sale.

In order to avoid damaging the 
electrical units, we strongly advise 
you not to use high pressure 
washing to clean the engine 
compartment.

After washing the vehicle dampness, 
or in winter, ice may form on the brake 
discs and pads: braking efficiency may 
be reduced. Make some light brake 
applications to dry and de-ice the 
brakes.

Filling
The fuel tank must be filled with the 
engine off.
-  Open the fuel filler flap.
- 

Insert the key, then turn it a quarter 
turn.

-  Remove the cap and hook it onto 

the clip located on the inside of the 
flap.

When filling with fuel, with the fuel 
filler flap open, ensure that no one 
attempts to open the sliding side 
door.

A label affixed to the inside of the flap 
reminds you of the type of fuel to be 
used.
You must fill with at least 5 litres of fuel 
for it to be registered by the fuel gauge.
When the fuel filler cap is opened, 
there may be a slight inrush of air. This 
vacuum is entirely normal and is due to 
the sealing of the fuel system.
When filling the fuel tank, do not 
continue after the 3rd cut-off of the 
nozzle. This could cause malfunctions.
The capacity of the fuel tank is 
approximately 60 litres (or 55 litres 
according to version).
-  After filling the fuel tank, lock the 

cap and close the flap.

REFUELLING

Low fuel level

When the low fuel level is 
reached, this warning lamp 
comes on.

You then have approximately 8 litres 
of fuel remaining.
Fill up without delay to avoid running 
out of fuel.
Never risk driving until you run out of 
fuel as this may damage the emissions 
control and injection systems.

FuelFuel used for petrol engines

FuelBLUEHDI AND ADBLUE®

SCR technology
The aim of BlueHDi is to reduce the 
emissions of NOx (nitrous oxides) in 
the air by up to 90%, using a system 
that converts NOx into water vapour 
and nitrogen in a dedicated catalytic 
converter: SCR (Selective Catalytic 
Reduction).
This objective meets the "Euro 6" 
emissions standard adopted by the 
European Union aimed at limiting the 
emissions of pollutants from internal 
combustion engines.
The SCR technology used on BlueHDi 
engines involves the injection of 
AdBlue® into the exhaust system.

AdBlue® is the brand name of the 
solution needed for operation of the 
SCR system.

BlueHDi vehicles have a specific 
AdBlue® additive tank with a capacity 
of 17 litres.
It has an exterior filler with a blue filler 
cap, located to the left of the Diesel 
fuel filler cap.
Filling of the AdBlue® tank can be 
done using 5 or 10 litre containers, 
1.89 litre bottles, or when at a fuel 
filling station equipped with a special 
AdBlue® delivery pump for light 
vehicles.

This operation can also be carried 
out by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

Please note that the high delivery 
pumps at some filling stations, 
intended only for lorries and coaches, 
are not suitable for cars or light 
commercial vehicles.
Never use these pumps.

Filling the AdBlue® tank
For light vehicles, 5 or 10 litre 
containers and 1.89 litre (1/2 US 
gallon) bottles are available from 
CITROËN dealers, until they are 
equipped with AdBlue® delivery pumps.
If you want to fill the AdBlue® tank 
yourself, ensure that you have a 
suitable filler pipe, which may or may 
not be supplied with the additive 
container.

Good practice

The presence of this label 
indicates the use of a 12 V 
lead-acid battery with special 

technology and specification, for which 
the involvement of a CITROËN dealer 
or qualified workshop is required when 
replacing or disconnecting the battery.
Failure to observe this 
recommendation may cause premature 
wear of the battery.

After refitting the battery, the Stop & 
Start system will only be active after 
several hours depending on the 
climatic conditions and the state of 
charge of the battery (up to about 
8 hours).

The Stop & Start battery does not have 
to be disconnected for charging.

To charge the battery using a 
battery charger
-  Disconnect the battery.
-  Follow the instructions for use 

given by the battery charger 
manufacturer.

-  Reconnect starting with the 

negative (-) terminal.

-  Check that the terminals and 

connectors are clean. If they are 
covered with sulphate (white or 
greenish deposit), disconnect them 
and clean them.

To start the vehicle from 
another battery
-  Connect the red cable to the 
positive (+) terminals of the 
two batteries.

-  Connect one end of the green 

or black cable to the negative (-) 
terminal of the slave battery.

-  Connect the other end of the green 
or black cable to an earth point on 
the broken down vehicle as far as 
possible from the battery.

-  Operate the starter, let the engine run.
-  Wait for the engine to return to idle, 

then disconnect the cables.

 It is advisable to disconnect the 
battery if the vehicle is not to be 
used for a period of more than one 
month.

Before disconnecting the battery, you 
must wait for 2 minutes after switching 
off the ignition.
Never disconnect a terminal when the 
engine is running.
Never charge a battery without first 
disconnecting the terminals.
After every reconnection of the battery, 
switch on the ignition and wait 1 minute 
before starting to allow the electronic 
systems to be initialised. If problems 
remain after doing this, please contact 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.
After changing bulbs, wait 
approximately 3 minutes before 
reconnecting the battery.

BatteryECONOMY MODE
After the engine has stopped, with 
the key in the ignition position, certain 
functions (windscreen wiper, electric 
windows, courtesy lamps, audio 
equipment, etc.) can only be used for a 
cumulative duration of thirty minutes, to 
prevent discharging of the battery.
Once the thirty minutes have elapsed, 
the active functions are put on standby 
and the battery warning lamp flashes 
accompanied by a message in the 
screen.
To resume the use of these functions 
immediately, start the engine and let it 
run for a few minutes.
The time available will then be double 
the time for which the engine was left 
running. However, this time will always 
be between five and thirty minutes.

A flat battery will prevent the 
engine from starting.

TEMPORARY PUNCTURE RE-
PAIR KIT
The kit is located in one of the two 
storage compartments located under 
the front seats.
Vehicles supplied with a temporary 
puncture repair kit do not have a spare 
wheel or tooling (jack, wheelbrace, ...).

The temporary tyre repair kit consists 
of a compressor and a bottle 
(containing a sealant).

Using the kit
-  Tick the deflated wheel on the 

speed limitation sticker then affix 
the sticker to the vehicle's steering 
wheel to remind you that a wheel is 
in temporary use.

it to the bottle.

-  Connect the power lead to one of 

the vehicle's 12V sockets.

-  Switch on the compressor by 

pressing button A until the tyre 
pressure reaches 2.0 bars. If this 
pressure cannot be reached, the 
tyre cannot be repaired.

-  Remove and store the compressor.
-  Drive immediately, for a few miles 
(kilometres), at reduced speed, to 
fill the puncture.

-  Adjust the pressure using the 

compressor in accordance with the 
recommendation for the vehicle and 
check that the leak is filled correctly 
(no further loss of pressure).

-  Drive at reduced speed (50 mph 

[80 km/h]). The tyre must be 
examined and repaired by a 
specialist as soon as possible.

After use, the bottle can be stored in 
a plastic bag, supplied in the kit, to 
avoid staining your vehicle with traces 
of fluid.

Warning: the sealant product is 
harmful if swallowed and causes 
irritation to the eyes.
Keep it out of reach of children.

After use, do not discard the bottle into 
the environment, take it to a CITROËN 
dealer or to an specialised waste 
disposal site.
Replacement bottles of sealant are 
available from CITROËN dealers.

CHANGING A WHEEL
1. Parking the vehicle

vehicle and wait in a safe location.
If possible, park the vehicle on 
level, stable and non-slippery 
ground.

- 

-  Apply the parking brake, switch 

off the ignition and engage first or 
reverse gear.

-  Place the chock against the wheel 
diagonally opposite the one to be 
changed.

If the vehicle is fitted with a towbar, 
it is sometimes necessary to raise 
the vehicle slightly to make it easier 
to remove the spare wheel from its 
carrier.
On certain types of ground and/
or if considerable loads are being 
transported, call a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop.

The jack and the tool kit are specific to

Advice on installation
F  If you have to fit the chains during 
a journey, stop the vehicle on a flat 
surface on the side of the road.

F  Apply the parking brake and 
position any wheel chocks to 
prevent movement of your vehicle.

F  Fit the chains following the 
instructions provided by the 
manufacturer.

F  Move off gently and drive for a 

few moments, without exceeding 
30 mph (50 km/h).

F  Stop your vehicle and check that 

the snow chains are correctly 
tightened.

 The snow chains must be fitted only 
to the driving wheels. They must 
never be fitted to "space-saver" type 
spare wheels.

For more information on snow chains, 
contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

It is recommended that before you 
leave, you practise fitting the snow 
chains on a level and dry surface.

 Take account of the legislation in 
force in your country on the use 
of snow chains and the maximum 
running speed authorised.

Avoid driving with chains on roads 
that have been cleared of snow, 
to avoid damaging your vehicle's 

tyres and the road surface. If your 
vehicle is fitted with alloy wheels, 
check that no part of the chain or its 
fixings is in contact with the wheel rim.

The maximum weights and towed 
loads for your vehicle can be found on 
the vehicle's registration certificate.

The location of the manufacturer's 
plate is given in chapter 9, 
"Identification markings" section.

The recommended nose weight is 
the downward force on the towball 
(removable with or without tools).

GVW: gross vehicle weight, the 
maximum authorised weight.
GTW: gross train weight, the maximum 
weight for vehicle plus trailer.

High ambient temperatures 
may result in a reduction in the 
performance of the vehicle in 
order to protect the engine. When  
the ambient temperature is higher  
than 37 °C, limit the towed weight.

Towing with a lightly loaded 
vehicle can adversely affect road 
holding.

Towing a trailer increases braking 
distances.
When towing, the maximum permitted 
speed is reduced (comply with the 
legislation in force in the country).

In each country, it is imperative that 
the maximum towed loads authorised 
by local legislation are complied 
with. To find out your vehicle's towing 
capacities and its gross train weight, 
consult a CITROËN dealer.

The kerb weight is equal to the weight 
without load + driver (75 kg) + fuel tank 
filled to 90%.
The GTW and towed load values 
indicated are valid up to a maximum 
altitude of 1000 metres. The value of 
the towed load mentioned must be 
reduced by 10 % for each additional 
1000 metres.
With load transfer, the braked trailer 
weight can be increased, on condition 
that the equivalent of this load is 
removed from the vehicle so that the 
GTW is not exceeded.

Pairing a Bluetooth® 
telephone

For reasons of safety and because they 
require prolonged attention on the part 
of the driver, the operations for pairing 
the Bluetooth® mobile telephone to the 
hands-free system of the audio system 
must be carried out with the vehicle 
stationary.

Procedure from the system

and ensure that it is "visible to all" (telephone 
configuration).

Press on Telephone to display the 
primary page.

Procedure (short) from the 
telephone
In the Bluetooth® menu of your device, select 
the system name in the list of devices detected.

Enter a code of at least 4 figures in the device 
and confirm.

Enter this same code in the system, 
select "OK" and confirm.

Press on the secondary page.

Select "Bluetooth connection".

Select "Search for devices".
The list of telephones detected is 
displayed.

- 

- 

Select the name of the 
desired peripheral from the 
list and "Confirm".

Enter a code of at least 4 figures for 
the connection then "Confirm".

Enter this same code in the telephone then 
accept the connection.

The system offers to connect the telephone:
- 

in "Telephone" (hands-free kit, telephone 
only),
in "Audio streaming" (streaming: wireless 
playing of audio files from the telephone),
in "Internet" (internet browsing, only if your 
telephone is compatible with the "DUN" 
Dial-Up Networking Bluetooth® standard).

If the telephone is not detected, it is 
recommended that you switch the 
Bluetooth® function on your telephone 
off and then on again.

Select one or more profiles and confirm.

Audio and TelematicsDepending on the type of telephone, 
the system will ask you to accept or not 
the transfer of your contacts.

If not, select "Update".

On return to the vehicle, if the last telephone 
connected is present again, it is reconnected 
automatically and within around 30 seconds 
after switching on the ignition the pairing is 
done without any action on your part, with 
(Bluetooth® activated).
To modify the automatic connection mode, 
select the telephone in the list then select the 
desired profile.

The services available depend 
on the network, the SIM card and 
the compatibility of the Bluetooth® 
telephone used. Check the telephone 
manual and with your network provider 
for details of the services available to 
you.

The ability of the system to connect 
with only one profile depends on the 
telephone. The three profiles may all 
connect by default.

Visit www.citroen.co.uk for more information 
(compatibility, additional help, ...).

The recognised telephone 
appears in the list.

Depending on your telephone, you may be 
asked to accept automatic connection every 
time the ignition is switched on.

Frequently asked questions

The table below gives answers to the most frequently asked questions on your audio system.
Navigation
QUESTION

ANSWER

The route calculation is not 
successful.

The navigation settings may conflict with the current location 
(exclusion of toll roads on a toll motorway).

SOLUTION

Check the settings in the "Navigation" menu.

The POIs do not appear.

The POIs have not been selected.

Select the POIs in the list of POIs.

The Risk areas audible 
warning does not work.

The audible warning is not active.

Activate audible warnings in the "Navigation" 
menu.

The system does not 
suggest a detour around an 
incident on the route.

The guidance criteria do not take account of TMC messages.

Select the "Information" function in the list of 
guidance criteria.

I receive a Risk areas alert 
which is not on my route.

Other than guidance, the system announces all Risk areas 
positioned in a cone located in front of the vehicle. It may provide an 
alert for Risk areas located on nearby or parallel roads.

Zoom in on the map to view the exact position of 
the Risk areas. Select "On the route" to no longer 
receive alerts other than guidance or to reduce 
the time for the announcement.

QUESTION

Certain traffic jams along 
the route are not indicated 
in real time.

ANSWER

On starting, it is several minutes before the system begins to receive 
the traffic information.

SOLUTION

Wait until the traffic information is being received 
correctly (display of the traffic information icons 
on the map).

The filters are too restrictive.

Modify the settings.

In certain countries, only major routes (motorways...) are listed for 
the traffic information.

This phenomenon is normal. The system is 
dependent on the traffic information available.

The altitude is not 
displayed.

On starting, the initialisation of the GPS may take up to 3 minutes to 
receive more than 4 satellites correctly.

Depending on the geographical environment (tunnel...) or the 
weather, the conditions of reception of the GPS signal may vary.

Wait until the system has completed starting 
up, so that there is GPS coverage of at least 
4 satellites.

This phenomenon is normal. The system 
is dependent on the GPS signal reception 
conditions.

Radio

QUESTION

The quality of reception of 
the radio station listened 
to gradually deteriorates 
or the stored stations do 
not function (no sound, 
87.5 Mhz is displayed...).

I cannot find some radio 
stations in the list of 
stations received.

The name of the radio 
station changes.

ANSWER

The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station 
listened to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area 
through which the vehicle is travelling.

SOLUTION

Activate the "RDS" function by means of the 
short-cut menu to enable the system to check 
whether there is a more powerful transmitter in 
the geographical area.

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, basement car parks...) 
block reception, including in RDS mode.

This phenomenon is normal and does not indicate 
a fault with the audio system.

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going 
through a car wash or into an underground car park).

Have the aerial checked by a CITROËN dealer.

The station is not received or its name has changed in the list.

Press on the "Update list" function in the system 
to update the list of stations received.

Some radio stations send other information in place of their name 
(the title of the song for example).
The system interprets this information as the name of the station.

Media

QUESTION
Playback of my USB 
memory stick starts only 
after a very long wait 
(around 2 to 3 minutes).

When I connect my iPhone 
as telephone and to the 
USB port at the same time, 
I am unable to play the 
music files.

Some characters in the 
media information are not 
displayed correctly while 
playing.

Playing of streaming files 
does not start.

The names of tracks and 
the track length are not 
displayed on the screen 
when streaming audio.

ANSWER

SOLUTION

Some files supplied with the memory stick may greatly slow down 
access to reading the memory stick (multiplication by 10 of the 
catalogue time).

Delete the files supplied with the memory stick 
and limit the number of sub-folders in the file 
structure on the memory stick.

When the iPhone connects automatically as a telephone, it forces 
the streaming function. The streaming function takes the place of 
the USB function which is then not useable, there is a period without 
sound of the track being played with Apple® players.

Disconnect and reconnect to the USB port  
(the USB function takes priority over streaming).

The audio system does not display some types of characters.

Use standard characters to name tracks and 
folders.

The peripheral device connected does not support automatic play.

Start the playback from the device.

The Bluetooth profile does not allow the transfer of this information.

Settings

QUESTION

In changing the setting 
of treble and bass the 
equalizer setting is 
deselected.

In changing the equalizer 
setting, treble and bass 
return to zero.

When changing the 
balance settings, the 
distribution setting is 
deselected.

When changing a sound 
distribution setting, 
the balance setting is 
deselected.

When I select the "All 
passengers" mode, the 
distribution is not as I 
would like.

ANSWER

SOLUTION

The selection of an equalizer setting imposes the balance settings.
Modifying one without the other is not possible.

Modify the balance or equalizer settings to obtain 
the desired musical ambience.

The selection of a distribution setting imposes the balance settings.
Modifying one without the other is not possible.

Modify the balance or distribution settings to 
obtain the desired musical ambience.

The choice of an "All passengers" distribution can be programmed. Modify the distribution setting using the slider on

QUESTION

There is a difference in 
sound quality between the 
different audio sources.

ANSWER

For optimum sound quality, the audio settings for Volume:, Bass:, 
Treble:, Ambience and Loudness can be adapted to the different 
sound sources, which may result in audible differences when 
changing source.

SOLUTION

Check that the audio settings for (Volume:, Bass:, 
Treble:, Ambience, Loudness) are adapted to the 
sources listened to. It is advisable to set the audio 
functions (Bass:, Treble:, Balance) to the middle 
position, select the "None" musical ambience 
and set the loudness correction to the "Inactive" 
position in radio mode.

With the engine off, the 
system switches off after a 
few minutes of use.

When the engine is switched off, the system's operating time 
depends on the state of charge of the battery.
The switch-off is normal: the system switches to economy mode and 
switches off to prevent discharging of the vehicle's battery.

Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery 
charge.

Telephone

QUESTION
I cannot connect my 
Bluetooth telephone.

The volume of the 
telephone connected 
in Bluetooth mode is 
inaudible.

ANSWER

The telephone's Bluetooth function may be switched off or the 
telephone may not be visible.

The Bluetooth telephone is not compatible with the system.

The volume depends both on the system and on the telephone.

The ambient noise level has an influence on the quality of telephone 
communication.

Some contacts are 
duplicated in the list.

The options for synchronizing contacts are synchronizing the 
contacts on the SIM card, the contacts on the telephone, or both . 
When both synchronizations are selected, some contacts may be 
duplicated.

SOLUTION

Check that your telephone's Bluetooth function is 
switched on.
Check in the telephone settings that it is "Visible 
to all".

You can check the compatibility of your telephone 
at www.citroen.co.uk (services).

Increase the volume of the audio system, to 
maximum if required, and increase the volume of 
the telephone if necessary.

Reduce the ambient noise level (close the 
windows, reduce the booster fan speed, slow 
down...).
Select "Display SIM card contacts" or "Display 
telephone contacts".

Contacts are not shown in 
alphabetical order.

Some telephones offer display options. Depending on the settings 
chosen, contacts can be transferred in a specific order.

Modify the display setting in the telephone 
directory.

The system does not receive 
SMS text messages.

The Bluetooth mode does not permit sending SMS text messages to 
the system.

parks, ...) may block reception, 
including in RDS mode. This is a 
normal effect of the way in which radio 
waves are transmitted and does not 
indicate any failure of the audio system.

Select "Activate RDS".

Press OK, RDS is displayed in the 
screen.

Press the MENU button.

In "Radio" mode, press OK directly to activate /

Press OK.

RDS, if displayed, enables you to continue 
listening to the same station by automatic 
retuning to alternative frequencies. 
However, in certain conditions, coverage 
of an RDS station may not be assured 
throughout the country as radio stations 
do not cover 100 % of the territory. This 
explains the loss of reception of a station 
that can occur during a journey.

Frequently asked questions

The table below gives answers to the most frequently asked questions on your audio system.

QUESTION

With the engine off, the 
audio system switches off 
after a few minutes of use.

ANSWER

SOLUTION

When the engine is switched off, the audio system operating time 
depends on the state of charge of the battery.
The switch-off is normal: the audio equipment switches to economy 
mode and switches off to prevent discharging of the vehicle's 
battery.

Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery 
charge.

The message "the audio 
system is overheated" 
appears on the display.

In order to protect the installation if the surrounding temperature 
is too high, the audio system switches to an automatic thermal 
protection mode leading to a reduction in volume or CD play 
stopping.

Switch the audio system off for a few minutes to 
allow the system to cool.

Radio

QUESTION

ANSWER

SOLUTION

There is a difference in 
sound quality between the 
different audio sources 
(radio, CD...).

For optimum sound quality, the audio settings (Volume, Bass, 
Treble, Ambience, Loudness) can be adapted to the different sound 
sources, which may result in audible differences when changing 
source (radio, CD...).

Check that the audio settings (Volume, Bass, 
Treble, Ambience, Loudness) are adapted to 
the sources listened to. It is advisable to set 
the audio functions (Bass, Treble, Front-Rear 
Balance, Left-Right Balance) to the middle 
position, select the musical ambience "None" 
and set the loudness correction to the "Active" 
position in CD mode or to the "Inactive" position 
in radio mode.

QUESTION

The stored stations do not 
function (no sound,  
87.5 Mhz is displayed...).

The traffic announcement 
(TA) is displayed. I do 
not receive any traffic 
information.

The quality of reception of 
the radio station listened 
to gradually deteriorates 
or the stored stations do 
not function (no sound, 
87.5 Mhz is displayed...).

An incorrect waveband is selected.

ANSWER

SOLUTION

Press the BAND AST button to return to the 
waveband (AM, FM1, FM2, FMAST) on which the 
stations are stored.

The radio station is not part of the regional traffic information 
network.

Tune to a radio station which broadcasts traffic 
information.

The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station 
listened to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area 
through which the vehicle is travelling.

Activate the RDS function to enable the system 
to check whether there is a more powerful 
transmitter in the geographical area.

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, underground car parks...) 
block reception, including in RDS mode.

This phenomenon is normal and does not 
indicate a failure of the audio equipment.

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going 
through an automatic car wash or into an underground car park).

Have the aerial checked by a CITROËN dealer.

Sound cut-outs of 1 to 
2 seconds in radio mode.

During this brief sound cut-out, the RDS searches for another 
frequency giving better reception of the station.

Deactivate the RDS function if the phenomenon 
is too frequent and always on the same route.

QUESTION
The message "USB 
peripheral error" is 
displayed on the screen.
The Bluetooth® connection 
is cut.

The CD is ejected 
automatically or is not 
played by the player.

The battery of the peripheral may not be sufficiently charged.

Recharge the battery of the peripheral device.

ANSWER

SOLUTION

The USB memory stick is not recognised.
The USB memory stick may be corrupt.

Reformat the USB memory stick.

The CD is inserted upside down, is unplayable, does not contain 
any audio data or contains an audio format which the player cannot 
play.
The CD is protected by an anti-pirating protection system which is 
not recognised by the audio equipment.

-  Check that the CD is inserted in the player 

the right way up.

-  Check the condition of the CD: the CD 

cannot be played if it is too damaged.

-  Check the content in the case of a recorded 
CD: consult the advice in the "Audio" section.
The audio equipment's CD player does not 
play DVDs.

- 

-  Due to their quality level, certain writeable 
CDs will not be played by the audio system.

The CD player sound is 
poor.

The CD used is scratched or of poor quality.

Insert good quality CDs and store them in 
suitable conditions.

The audio equipment settings (bass, treble, ambiences) are 
unsuitable.

Set the treble or bass level to 0, without selecting 
an ambience.

Connect Box offer with the SOS and 
assistance pack included, there are 
additional services available to you in 
your personal space, via the Internet 
website for your country.
