 ENVIRONMENT 

  With you, CITROËN acts to protect the 
environment. 
 We invite you to visit the 
 www.citroen.co.uk  website. 

 As the driver, you also can contribute to 
protecting the environment by following 
certain rules: 
   -  

adopt a preventive style of driving, 
without frequent and harsh acceleration, 
observe the service intervals; we 
recommend that services are carried 
out by a CITROËN dealer, authorised to 
collect used batteries and fluids, 
in order to preserve the reliability of the 
engine and emission control systems, do 
not use engine oil additives.

                                 ECO-DRIVING 

 Eco-driving is a range of everyday practices that allow the motorist to optimise their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. 

  Optimise the use of your gearbox 

  Control the use of your electrical equipment 

  With a manual gearbox, move off gently and change up without 
waiting. While accelerating changing up early. If your vehicle has 
the system, the gear shift indicator invites you to engage the most 
suitable gear; follow its instructions as soon as it is displayed in 
the instrument panel.   

  Drive smoothly 
  Maintain a safe distance between vehicles, use engine 
braking rather than the brake pedal, and press the accelerator 
progressively. These practices contribute towards a reduction in 
fuel consumption and CO2 emissions and also helps reduce the 
background traffic noise.  

  If your vehicle has cruise control, make use of the system at 
speeds above 25 mph (40 km/h) when the traffic is flowing well.   

  Before moving off, if the passenger compartment is too warm, 
ventilate it by opening the windows and air vents before using the 
air conditioning. 
 Above 30 mph (50 km/h), close the windows and leave the air 
vents open. 
 Remember to make use of equipment that can help keep the 
temperature in the passenger compartment down (window 
blinds...). 
 Switch off the air conditioning, unless it has automatic digital 
regulation, as soon as the desired temperature is attained. 
 Switch off the demisting and defrosting controls, if not automatic. 
 Switch off the heated seat as soon as possible.  

  Switch off the headlamps and front foglamps when the level of 
light does not require their use.  

  Avoid running the engine before moving off, particularly in winter; 
your vehicle will warm up much faster while driving.  

  As a passenger, if you avoid connecting your multimedia devices 
(film, music, video game...), you will contribute towards limiting the 
consumption of electrical energy, and so of fuel. 
 Disconnect your portable devices before leaving the vehicle.   

  Limit the causes of excess consumption 

  Observe the recommendations on maintenance 

  Spread loads throughout the vehicle; place the heaviest items in 
the bottom of the boot, as close as possible to the rear seats. 
 Limit the loads carried in the vehicle and reduce wind resistance 
(roof bars, roof rack, bicycle carrier, trailer...). Use a roof box in 
preference. 
 Remove roof bars and roof racks after use.  

  Check the tyre pressures regularly, when cold, referring to the 
label in the door aperture, driver's side. 
 Carry out this check in particular: 
   -  
  -  
  -  
 Don't forget the spare wheel and the tyres on any trailer or 
caravan.  

before a long journey, 
at each change of season, 
after a long period out of use.  

  At the end of winter, remove snow tyres and refit your summer 
tyres.   

  Have your vehicle serviced regularly (engine oil, oil filter, air 
filter, cabin filter...) and observe the schedule of operations in the 
maintenance and warranty guide.    

  When refuelling, do not continue after the 3 rd  cut-off of the nozzle 
to avoid any overflow.  

  At the wheel of your new vehicle, it is only after the ﬁ rst 1 800 miles 
(3 000 kilometres) that you will see the fuel consumption settle 
down to a consistent average.

 ELECTRONIC IMMOBILISER 
 All of the keys contain an electronic 
immobiliser device. 
 This device locks the engine supply system. 
It is activated automatically when the key is 
removed from the ignition. 

 After the ignition is switched on, a dialogue 
is established between the key and the 
electronic immobiliser system. 

 This warning lamp is switched off 
after the ignition is switched on 
and the key has been recognised, 
the engine can be started. 

 If the key is not recognised, the engine 
cannot be started. Use another key and 
have the faulty key checked by a CITROËN 
dealer. 

  Good practice 
 Make a careful note of the number of the 
keys. If they are lost, your CITROËN dealer 
will be able to carry out his work more 
quickly and effectively if you give him this 
number and the confidential card. 
 Do not make any modifications to the 
electronic immobiliser system. 

 Operating the remote control, even when it 
is in your pocket, may result in involuntary 
unlocking of the doors. 
 However, if none of the doors is opened 
within approximately thirty seconds following 
unlocking, the doors relock automatically. 
 The simultaneous use of other high 
frequency equipment (mobile telephones, 
domestic alarms…), may interfere with the 
operation of the remote control temporarily. 
 The remote control does not operate while 
the key is in the ignition, even if the ignition 
is off, except for reinitialisation. 

  When purchasing a second-hand vehicle:  
   -  

ensure that you are given the 
confidential card, 
have the keys memorised by a 
CITROËN dealer to ensure that the keys 
in your possession are the only ones 
which can start the vehicle.  

  -  

 Driving with the doors locked may make 
access to the passenger compartment 

by the emergency services more difﬁ cult in an 
emergency. 
 As a safety precaution (with children on board), 
remove the key from the ignition when leaving 
the vehicle, even for a short time.  

 CONFIDENTIAL CARD 
 This is given to you on delivery of your 
vehicle with the duplicate keys. 
 It contains the identification code necessary 
for any work carried out by a CITROËN 
dealer on the electronic immobiliser system. 
This code is hidden by a film, which should

 Keep your card in a safe place, never inside

 ALARM 
 If your vehicle is fitted with an anti-theft 
alarm. 
 This provides: 
   -  

exterior perimeter protection by 
detectors on the openings (doors, 
bonnet) and on the electrical power 
supply, 
anti-tilt protection * .  

  -  

  Activation of the alarm 
 First ensure that all of the doors and bonnet 
are closed correctly. 

 The alarm is set by pressing this 
padlock, the protection is active 
after a few seconds. 
 While the alarm is monitoring, 

any intrusion triggers the siren for 
approximately 30 seconds, accompanied by 
illumination of the direction indicators. 

 The alarm then returns to 
monitoring mode but the triggering 
event is stored and is indicated 
by illumination of the electronic 

immobiliser warning lamp for about 
10 seconds when the ignition is switched on. 
 The alarm is also triggered following an 
electrical supply cut-off, when the supply is 
restored.  

  Remote control fault 
 Unlock the doors using the key, the alarm is 
triggered. 
 Switch on the ignition, recognition of the 
key's code turns off the alarm. 

  Locking the doors with the key does 
not set the alarm.   

  Deactivation using the remote control 
 When this button is pressed, the 
alarm is deactivated when the 
vehicle is unlocked.  

  Deactivation of the anti-tilt 
protection *  

 Press this control to deactivate 
the protection (when towing the 
vehicle with the alarm on, for 
example). 

 The protection remains active until the doors 
are unlocked with the central locking.  

  *   Depending on engine.

   Access   

  Good practice 
  To deactivate the siren quickly following 
a false alarm:  
   -  

switch on the ignition, recognition of the 
key's code will switch off the alarm, 
press the unlocking button (cab and key) 
on the remote control.  

  -  

 To avoid setting the alarm, when washing 
the vehicle for example, lock the vehicle 
using the key. 
 Unlocking the vehicle using the remote 
control deactivates the siren automatically.

 EMISSIONS CONTROLS 
 EOBD (European On Board Diagnosis) is 
a diagnostics system which complies with, 
among others, the standards concerning 
authorised emissions of: 
   -   CO (carbon monoxide), 
  -   HC (unburnt hydrocarbons), 
  -   NOx (nitrous oxides) or particles, 

detected by oxygen sensors placed 
upstream and downstream of the 
catalytic converters.  

 The driver is warned of any 
malfunction of this emission 
control system by the illumination 
of this specific warning lamp in 
the instrument panel. 

 There is a risk of damage to the catalytic 
converter. Have it checked by a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop. 

       TYRE UNDER-INFLATION DETECTION  

   Instruments and controls   

3
3

  This system does not avoid the need 
to check the tyre pressures regularly 
(including the spare wheel) and before a 
long journey. 
 Driving with under-inflated tyres adversely 
affects road holding, extends braking 
distances and causes premature tyre 
wear, particularly under arduous conditions 
(vehicle loaded, high speed, long journey).  

  System which automatically checks the 
pressures of the tyres while driving. 

 The system continuously monitors the 
pressures of the four tyres, as soon as the 
vehicle is moving. 
 A pressure sensor is located in the valve of 
each tyre (except the spare wheel). 
 The system triggers an alert if a drop in 
pressure is detected in one or more tyres.  

  Driving with under-inflated tyres 
increases fuel consumption.  

  The tyre pressures must be checked 
when the tyres cold (vehicle stopped 

for 1 hour or after driving for less then 
6 miles (10 km) at moderate speed). 
Otherwise, add 0.3 bar to the values 
indicated on the label. 
 The tyre pressures for your vehicle can be 
found on the tyre pressure label. 

  The tyre under-inflation detection 
system is an aid to driving which does 

not replace the need for the driver to be 
vigilant or to drive responsibly.  

 Refer to the "Technical data - 
Identification markings" section.

  The alert is given by the ﬁ xed 
illumination of this warning lamp, 
accompanied by an audible signal, 
and depending on equipment, the 
display of a message.  

  In the event of a problem on one of the 
tyres, the symbol or the message appears, 
according to equipment, to identify it. 
   -   Reduce speed, avoid sudden steering 

movements or harsh brake applications. 

 
  -  

  -   Stop as soon as it is safe to do so. 
In the event of a puncture, use the 
  -  
temporary puncture repair kit or the 
spare wheel (according to equipment),  
or 
if you have a compressor, the one in 
the temporary puncture repair kit for 
example, check the four tyre pressures 
when cold,  
or 
if it is not possible to check the tyre 
pressures at the time, drive carefully at 
reduced speed.   

 
  -  

  The loss of pressure detected does 
not always lead to visible deformation 

of the tyre. Do not rely on just a visual 
check.  

  The alert is maintained until the tyre or 
tyres concerned is reinflated, repaired 

or replaced. 
 The spare wheel (space-saver type or a 
steel rim) does not have a sensor.   

  Operating fault 

  The flashing and then fixed 
illumination of this warning lamp 
accompanied by the illumination 
of the service warning lamp, and 

depending on equipment, the display of a 
message indicates a fault with the system. 
 In this case, monitoring of the tyre pressures 
is not assured.  

  This alert is also displayed when one or 
more wheels is not fitted with a sensor 
(for example, a space-saver or steel spare 
wheel).  

  Go to a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked or, 
following the repair of a puncture, to have 
the original wheel, equipped with a sensor, 
refitted.   

 SERVICE INDICATOR 
 For a few seconds after the ignition is 
switched on, the spanner symbolising the 
service indicator comes on: the screen

 HILL START ASSIST 
 This system (also called HHC - Hill Holder 
Control), linked to the dynamic stability 
control system, makes hill starts easier and 
is activated in the following conditions: 
   -  

the vehicle must be stationary, engine 
running, foot on the brake, 
the gradient of the road must be steeper 
than 5%, 
uphill, the gearbox must be in neutral or 
in a gear other than reverse, 
downhill, reverse gear must be engaged.  

  -  
 The Hill Start Assist function is a driving 
aid system. It is not an automatic vehicle 
parking function or an automatic parking 
brake. 

  -  

  -  

  Operation 
 With the brake pedal and clutch pedal 
pressed, from the time you release the brake 
pedal you have approximately 2 seconds 
before the vehicle starts to roll back and 
without using the parking brake within which 
to move off. 
 During the moving off phase, the function 
is deactivated automatically, gradually 
releasing the braking pressure. During 
this phase, the characteristic noise of 
mechanical release of the brakes may be 
heard, indicating the imminent movement of 
the vehicle. 

 Hill start assist is deactivated in the following 
situations: 
   -   when the clutch pedal is released, 
  -   when the parking brake is applied, 
  -   when the engine is switched off, 
  -   when the engine stalls.   

  Operating fault 

 If a malfunction of the system 
occurs, this warning lamp comes 
on accompanied by an audible 
signal and conﬁ rmed by a message 
in the screen. Have the system checked by at 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualiﬁ ed workshop.

   Starting and stopping   
       STOP & START 
 The Stop & Start system puts the engine 
temporarily into standby - STOP mode - 
during stops in the traffic (red lights, traffic 
jams, or other...). The engine restarts 
automatically - START mode - as soon as 
you want to move off. The restart takes 
place instantly, quickly and silently. 
 Perfect for urban use, the Stop & Start 
system reduces fuel consumption and 
exhaust emissions and offers the comfort 
of complete silence when stationary. 

  Automatic stopping of the engine is 
only possible after the vehicle has 

exceed a speed of about 6 mph (10 km/h), 
to avoid repeated stopping of the engine 
when driving slowly.  

  Never leave your vehicle with out first 
turning off the ignition with the key.  

  -  

  Never refuel with the engine 
in STOP mode; you must switch 

off the ignition with the key.  

  Operation 
  Going into engine STOP mode 
 With the vehicle stationary, put the gear 
lever into neutral, then release the clutch 
pedal. 

   -  

The  "S"  warning lamp 
comes on in the instrument 
panel and the engine goes 
into standby.   

  Special cases: STOP mode 
unavailable 
 The STOP mode is not invoked when: 
   -  
  -  
  -  
  -  
  -  
  -  
  -  

the system is initialising, 
the driver's door is open, 
the driver's seat belt is not fastened, 
the air conditioning is running, 
the heated rear screen is on, 
the windscreen wiper is on fast wipe, 
reverse gear is engaged, for a parking 
manoeuvre, 
some special conditions (battery 
charge, engine temperature, particle 
filter regeneration, braking assistance, 
ambient temperature...) where the 
engine is needed to assure control of a 
system.   

  The  "S"  warning lamp flashes for 
a few seconds, then goes off. 

  This operation is perfectly normal.   

  Going into engine START mode 

 With the vehicle in gear, automatic engine 
restarting is only allowed by fully depressing 
the clutch pedal. 

   -  

The  "S"  warning lamp goes 
off and the engine restarts.  

  -  

 If following an automatic restart in START 
mode, the driver takes no action on the 
the vehicle during the next  3 minutes, the 
system stops the engine definitively. The 
engine can then only be restarted using 
the key.  

  Special cases: START invoked 
automatically 
 The START mode is invoked automatically 
when: 
   -  
  -  
  -  
  -  

the vehicle's is free wheeling on a slope, 
the windscreen wiper is on fast wipe, 
the air conditioning is running, 
the engine has been stopped for around 
3 minutes with Stop & Start, 
some special conditions (battery charge, 
engine temperature, braking assistance, 
ambient temperature...) where the 
engine is needed to assure control of a 
system.   

  In this case, a message appears 
in the instrument panel screen, 
accompanied by the  "S"  warning 
lamp, which flashes for a few 
seconds, then goes off. 

  This operation is perfectly normal.    

   Starting and stopping

  Good practice 
  With a manual gearbox in STOP mode, if a 
gear is engaged without fully depressing the 
clutch pedal, restarting may not take place. 
 A warning lamp or message is displayed 
in the instrument panel asking you to fully 
depress the clutch pedal to allow restarting. 
 With the engine stopped in STOP mode, 
if the driver unfasten's their seat belt and 
opens a front door, the engine can only be 
restarted using the ignition key. There is an 
audible signal, accompanied by flashing of 
the  "S"  warning lamp and, depending on 
equipment, a message is displayed.

by a message in the instrument panel screen, 
conﬁ rms the the instruction has been registered. 

   If the system has been deactivated 
in STOP mode, the engine restarts 
immediately.  

  It is necessary to deactivate the Stop & 
Start system if you want to allow 

continuous operation of the air conditioning. 
 The switch warning lamp stays on.   

  Operating fault 

 In the event of a fault with the 
system, the Stop & Start system 
is deactivated and this warning 
lamp comes on, accompanied by a 

message in the instrument panel screen .
 Have it checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop. 
 In the event of an operating fault with STOP 
mode, it is possible to restart the engine by 
depressing the clutch pedal fully and putting 
the gear lever into neutral.  

  This system requires a specific battery 
with a special specification and technology 
(reference numbers available from a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop). 
 Fitting a battery not listed by 
CITROËN introduces the risk of malfunction 
of the system. 

 Refer to the "Quick help - Flat battery" 
section.  

  The Stop & Start system makes use 
of advanced technology. Specialist 
knowledge is needed for any work on the 
system, which can only be assured by 
CITROËN dealers.   

  Sound control 
 Your vehicle benefits from a suspension 
which contributes to improving general 
comfort. 
 These developments also contribute to 
reducing noise disturbance.  

  Acoustic comfort 
 The underseal under the body, on the body 
sills and on the wheel arches considerably 
reduces noise and protects the body from 
external attack.

 CRUISE CONTROL 
  "This is the speed at which the driver wishes to 
travel". 
 This aid to driving in free-ﬂ owing trafﬁ c conditions 
enables the vehicle to maintain a constant 
speed programmed by the driver, except when a 
considerable load is carried on a steep gradient. 
 In order to be programmed or activated, 
the vehicle speed must be greater than 
approximately 25 mph (40 km/h), with at least 
4th gear engaged. 

 If your vehicle is fitted with cruise control, 
this is displayed on the instrument panel by 
an indicator located in the rev counter. 

 Function selected.

exceeding the programmed speed. 
 The cruise control cannot, in any 
circumstances, replace the need to comply 
with speed limits nor can it replace the need 
for vigilance and responsibility on the part 
of driver. 
 It is advisable to leave your feet near the 
pedals. 
 To prevent the mat from becoming caught 
under the pedals: 
   -  

ensure that the mat is positioned

 Do not use the cruise control on slippery 
roads or in heavy traffic. 
 In the event of a steep slope, the cruise 
control cannot prevent the vehicle from 
exceeding the programmed speed. 
 In any event, the cruise control cannot 
replace the need to observe the speed 
limits, nor can it replace the need for 
vigilance and responsibility on the part of the 
driver. 
 It is advisable to leave your feet near the 
pedals. 
 To avoid any jamming under the pedals: 
   -  

ensure that the mat and its fixings on the 
floor are positioned correctly, 
never place one mat on top of another.   

  Switching the system off 
   -   Place the ring in the central  O  position 
or switch off the ignition to switch the 
system off.

 There are two methods of memorising a speed 
higher than the previous one: 
 Without using the accelerator: 
   -   Move the switch up (+).  
 A brief press increases the speed by 1 mph (km/h). 
 A maintained press increases the speed in steps of 
5 mph (km/h). 
 Using the accelerator: 
   -  

exceed the memorised speed until the speed 
required is reached, 

  -   move the switch up (+) or down (-).  
 To memorise a speed lower than the previous one: 
   -   move the switch down (-).  
 A brief press decreases the speed by 1 mph (km/h). 
 A maintained press decreases the speed in steps 
of 5 mph (km/h).

 SPEED LIMITER 
 "This is the selected speed which the driver 
does not wish to exceed". 
 This selection is made with the engine 
running while stationary or with the vehicle 
moving. The minimum speed which can be 
programmed is 20 mph (30 km/h). 
 The speed of the vehicle responds to the 
pressure of the driver's foot as far as the 
accelerator pedal point of resistance which 
indicates that the programmed speed has 
been reached. 

 However, pressing the pedal beyond this 
point of resistance to the floor permits 
exceeding of the programmed speed. To 
resume use of the limiter, simply reduce 
the pressure on the accelerator pedal 
gradually and return to a speed below that 
programmed. 
  The operating actions may be carried out 
when stationary, with the engine running, 
or with the vehicle moving.

  Exceeding the programmed speed 
 Pressing the accelerator pedal in order to 
exceed the programmed speed will have 
no effect unless you press the pedal  firmly  
beyond the  point of resistance . 
 If the limiter is unable to prevent an increase 
in the speed of the vehicle because of the 
profile of the road or when going down a 
step hill, the programmed speed may be 
exceeded. 
 The limiter is deactivated temporarily and 
the programmed speed flashes. 
 To return to the limiter function, reduce your 
speed to below the programmed speed.  

  Switching the system off 
   -   Place the ring in the central  O  position 
or switch off the ignition to switch the 
system off.  

 The last programmed speed remains in the 
memory.  

  Operating fault 
 The programmed speed is cleared then 
replaced by dashes. 
 Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked.  

  Good practice 
 In any event, the speed limiter cannot 
replace the need to observe speed limits, 
nor can it replace the need for vigilance and 
responsibility on the part of the driver. 
 Always pay attention to the profile of the 
road and sharp acceleration and stay in 
complete control of your vehicle. 
 To avoid any jamming under the pedals: 
   -  

ensure that the mat and its fixings on the 
floor are positioned correctly, 
never place one mat on top of another.   

  -  

 FIXED SPEED LIMITER 

 If your vehicle is fitted with this function, 
the speed of your vehicle can be limited 
to a fixed speed of approximately 55 mph 
(90 km/h) or 60 mph (100 km/h). This 
maximum speed cannot be changed. 
 A label in the passenger compartment 
indicates this maximum speed. 
 The fixed speed limiter is not a function 
of the cruise control type. It cannot be 
activated or deactivated by the driver while 
driving.

  DEMISTING AND DEFROSTING 
  Windscreen and side windows 
 The ventilation outlets located at the base 
of the windscreen and the side vents for the 
side windows increase the effectiveness 
of the demisting and defrosting. Do not 
obstruct these air outlets. 
 The pollen filter continuously and effectively 
filters dust. 
 Air recirculation (which can be activated by 
the driver or the passenger) isolates the 
passenger compartment from the exterior 
atmosphere. However, this position should 
only be used temporarily, normal use is to 
drive with the control positioned with the 
exterior air intake open. 

  Manual mode  

 Direct the control to this air 
distribution setting. 
 For faster and more effective 
demisting and defrosting of 
the windscreen: 

   -  

increase the air flow setting, 

  -   move the exterior air intake 

control temporarily to air 
recirculation.  

 Returning to the exterior air 
intake position permits renewal 
of the air in the passenger 
compartment.  

  Defrosting the rear screen 
and mirrors 

 Only operates when the engine 
is running. Pressing this button 
activates the rapid demisting-
defrosting of the rear screen and 

door mirrors. 
 This function switches off automatically to 
prevent excessive energy consumption. It 
stops when the engine is switched off but 
resumes when the engine is started again. 
 Pressing this button switches the function off.   

       With Stop & Start, when the heated 
rear screen is switched on, the STOP 
mode is not available.  

 CORRECT USE OF THE AIR 
CONDITIONING 
 In order to be effective, the air conditioning 
should only be used with the windows 
closed. However, if the interior temperature 
remains high after a prolonged period 
parked in the sun, first ventilate the 
passenger compartment for a few minutes. 

 For even air distribution, ensure that the 
exterior air intake grille located at the base 
of the windscreen, the side and central 
vents, the air outlets on the floor and the air 
extractor at the rear are not obstructed. 
 The air conditioning is useful in all seasons 
as it eliminates condensation and air 
humidity. 

9
5

   Ventilation   
 Operate the air conditioning system for 
5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a month, 

to keep it in good working order. 
 Have the filter elements (air filter and 
passenger compartment filter) replaced 
regularly. If you drive in a dusty environment, 
have them replaced twice as often. 
 It is normal that the condensation created by 
the air conditioning system results in a flow 
of water which may form a puddle under the 
vehicle when parked. 
 If the system does not produce cold air, 
do not use it and have it checked by a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop. 

  Vents 
  "Leave them open" 
 For optimum distribution and diffusion of hot 
or cool air in the passenger compartment, 
there are: 4 adjustable central vents, of 
which 2 can be directed sideways (right 
or left) towards the top of the body and 
4 side vents which can be directed towards 
the passengers. The air vents directed 
towards the floor of the vehicle complete the 
equipment.

 MANUAL HEATING / AIR 
CONDITIONING 
 If your vehicle is fitted with these controls, 
they are located on the dashboard on the 
centre console control panel. 

  Comfort value adjustment 
 Control positioned: 
   -  

in the blue zone provides cool 
air, 

  -  

in the red zone provides 
heating of the interior ambient 
air.   

  Air conditioning 
 The air conditioning mode can only operate 
with the engine running. 

 The air blower must be set to at 
least 1. 
 Pressing the button triggers the 
operation of the air conditioning, 

the LED is on. Pressing the button again 
switches the function off and the LED is 
switched off.  

  Air flow 

 The force of the blown air, from 
the vents, varies from 1 to the 
strongest 4. Remember to adjust 
this control in order to reach the 
ambient air comfort level. To switch off the 
blower, place the control in position 0.  

  Air distribution 
 The air supply distribution is directed by the 
control turned towards: 

 the side vents and the central 
vents, 

 the side vents, the central vents 
and the footwells, 

 the footwells, 

 the windscreen, the footwells and 
the side windows, 

 the windscreen and the side 
windows.  

  Intake of exterior air 

 This is the preferred operating 
position.  

  Recirculation of interior air 

 This position should only be 
temporary. 
 Used with the air conditioning 
switched on and setting of the 

force of blown air (from 1 to 4), recirculation 
enables you to obtain the required ambient 
air comfort level with both hot or cold 
settings. 
 Recirculation temporarily prevents exterior 
odours and smoke from entering the 
passenger compartment. 

 When your ambient air comfort level has 
been reached, return to the intake of exterior 
air position to permit renewal of the air in the 
passenger compartment and demisting. This 
operating mode is preferable.

 It can operate independently of the engine.  

  Additional heater or programmable 
additional heating 
 This is an additional, programmable and 
separate system which heats the Diesel 
engine hot coolant loop to make starting 
easier. 
 It improves the demisting and defrosting 
performance and that of the heated seats, if 
fitted to the vehicle. 
 The passenger compartment heating is 
brought up to temperature more rapidly. 
 This system must be programmed to start up 
before you enter the vehicle.  

  Supplementary heating 
 On the 2-3 seats version, this is located 
under the seat on the driver's side with air 
diffusion directed forwards. 

 On the 5-9 seats version, it is 
located at the rear. Depending 
on the model version, the air 
diffusion is either direct from the 

rear or comes from the rail located under 
each of the two rows of seats. 

 Press this control to activate/
deactivate the heating. The LED 
is on if the heating is activated.  
When rapid demisting and 

defrosting is required, switch off the control.  

 REAR HEATING AND / OR AIR 
CONDITIONING 

 If your vehicle is fitted with an 
additional air conditioning unit, 
located in the rear of the vehicle: 
the distribution rail located in 
the roof and the individual diffusion vents 
provide a perfect diffusion of cold air. 
 The warm air diffused at the floor, from the 
front air conditioning unit, is distributed at 
the feet of the rear passengers of rows 2 
and 3. 
 A warm air diffusion vent, located on the rear 
left wheelarch, may complete the assembly 
for the feet of the rear passengers of row 3.

beginning of winter. Maintenance and 
repairs should only be carried out by a 
CITROËN dealer. 
 Use only genuine replacement parts.  

  Two different types of equipment 
 The additional heating is separate and 
programmable. Before you enter the vehicle, 
it gradually increases the temperature of the 
engine to make starting easier. This also 
facilitates passenger compartment heating, 
demisting and defrosting. 

 The additional passenger compartment 
heating system supplements the 
standard equipment. Its operation may be 
independent of the engine. Switching on of 
the heating may be programmable.  

  Good practice 
 To avoid any risk of poisoning or 
asphyxiation, the additional heating must 
not be used, even for short periods, in 
an enclosed space such as a garage or 
workshop which is not fitted with an exhaust 
gas extraction system. 
 The additional heating is supplied by the 
vehicle's fuel tank. Ensure that the fuel 
gauge indicator lamp is not at reserve. 
 Always switch off the additional heating 
when filling with fuel to avoid any risk of fire 
or explosion. 
 Do not park the vehicle on an inflammable 
surface (dry grass, dead leaves, paper…), 
there is a risk of fire. 
 The temperature near the heater must not 
exceed 120 °C. A temperature higher than 
this (for example in the case of painting in 
an oven) could damage the components of 
the electronic circuits. 
 The additional heating system is fitted with 
a temperature limiter which cuts off the 
combustion in the event of overheating due 
to a lack of coolant. Top up the coolant, 
then press the programme selection control 
before switching the heating on again.

 MIRRORS 

  Rear view mirror 
 The lever located on the lower edge moves 
the mirror into two positions. 
 For the day position, the lever is pushed. 
 For the night position to prevent dazzle, pull 
the lever towards you.  

  Door mirrors 
 These are divided into two zones: 
  A -  Upper mirror 
  B -  Lower mirror 
 The mirror glass is spherical in order to 
widen the lateral field of vision. Objects 
seen in the mirror are in reality closer than 
they appear. Therefore, this must be taken 
into account in order to assess the distance 
correctly. 
 The shell incorporates the direction indicator 
side repeater and the aerials, according to 
the equipment available on board (GPS, 
GSM, Radio, ...).

 TACHOGRAPH 
 If your vehicle is fitted with a tachograph, 
this permits storing of all of the data relating 
to the vehicle in the unit and on a card 
inserted in it. 
 Example: at the beginning of each journey 
or change of team. 

 When the card is inserted, all of the data 
can be: 
   -  
  -  
  -  

displayed on the tachograph screen, 
printed, 
transferred to external storage media via 
an interface.  

 For further information, refer to the 
documents supplied by the manufacturer of 
the tachograph. 

 If your vehicle is fitted with a 
tachograph, disconnection of the 

negative (-) terminal of the battery (located 
under the floor on the left-hand side, in the 
cab) is recommended if the vehicle is not to 
be used for a period of more than 5 days. 

   Parking sensors   

1
9

 

 AUDIBLE REAR PARKING SENSORS 
 If fitted on your vehicle, the system consists 
of four proximity sensors, installed in the 
rear bumper. 
 They detect any obstacle: person, vehicle, 
tree, fence, behind the vehicle during the 
manoeuvre. 
 However, objects the size or thickness of 
which are detected at the beginning of the 
manoeuvre will no longer be detected at the 
end of the manoeuvre: blind spots between 
and below the sensors. Examples: stake, 
roadworks cone or pavement post. 
 The rear parking sensor system may be 
coupled with a reversing camera. 

  Operation 
 Engage reverse gear with the gear lever. 
 The proximity information is indicated by an 
audible signal of increasing frequency as the 
vehicle approaches the obstacle. 
 When the distance between the rear of 
the vehicle and the obstacle is less than 
approximately thirty centimetres, the audible 
signal becomes continuous. 
 The system cannot, in any circumstances, 
take the place of the vigilance and 
responsibility of the driver.  
  Switching off 
 Come our of reverse gear into neutral.  

  Operating fault 

 If this warning lamp comes 
on in the instrument panel 
accompanied by a message in 
the screen, contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.  

  Good practice 
 In bad weather or in winter, ensure that the 
sensors are not covered with mud, ice or 
snow.

 REVERSING CAMERA 
 If your vehicle is fitted with this camera, it is 
located at the rear, next to the third brake 
lamp. 
 It sends views to the screen installed 
in the cab. This rear vision is an aid to 
manoeuvring. 
 The reversing camera may be coupled with 
rear parking sensors. 

  Screen 
 The camera sends the images to a 5 inch 
LCD colour screen. This screen is also 
the one used by the touch screen audio-
telematic system. 
 Activation and deactivation of the system 
is done in the settings menu of the touch 
screen audio-telematic system.  

  Operation 
 The camera comes into operation when 
reverse gear is engaged and remains active 
up to approximately 9 mph (15 km/h). It is 
deactivated above 11 mph (18 km/h). 
 The camera also comes on, with the vehicle 
stationary, when the rear doors are opened.  

  Switching off 
 When a forward gear is engaged, the last 
image remains displayed for approximately 
5 seconds then switches off. 
 In the same way, the last image also 
remains displayed, with the vehicle 
stationary, when the rear doors are closed.  

  Good practice 
  With optimum vehicle conditions (position on 
the road, loading level) the maximum area of 
visibility covered by the camera has a ﬁ eld 
depth approximately 3 m long and 5.5 m wide. 
 The area of visibility may vary depending on 
the external weather conditions (brightness, 
rain, snow, fog, ...), the load in the vehicle 
and the position of the vehicle on the road. 
 When cleaning the camera and the screen, 
avoid using a detergent or a tool which may 
scratch the glass. 
 Use a non-abrasive cloth or a small brush.

 The control panel is located on the 
dashboard. 

 There is a nominal level as well as 6 height 
adjustment levels, raising (from +1 to +3) or 
lowering (from -1 to -3). Each level reached 
is indicated on the instrument panel screen.

nominal value.  

  Operating fault 

 If a fault occurs with the system, 
this warning lamp comes on. 

 Have the system checked by a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.  

  Good practice 
 Driving with the suspension set too high or 
too low risks damaging components under 
the body. 
 The height may be adjusted automatically to 
take account of changes of temperature or 
loading. 
 You must avoid using this control in the 
following circumstances: 
   -   when working underneath the vehicle, 
  -   when changing a wheel, 
  -   when the vehicle is being transported by 

lorry, train, ferry, boat, ...

 Press the centre of the steering wheel. 

  Anti-lock braking system and 
electronic brake force distribution 
 Linked systems which improve the stability 
and manoeuvrability of your vehicle when 
braking, in particular on poor or slippery 
surfaces. 

  Operation 
 The anti-lock braking system comes into 
operation automatically when there is a risk 
of wheel lock. 
 Normal operation of the ABS may make 
itself felt by slight vibration of the brake 
pedal accompanied by some noise.  

   When braking in an emergency, press 
very firmly without releasing the 
pressure.  

  Switching off 
 These systems cannot be deactivated by 
the driver.  

  Operating fault 

 If this warning lamp comes on, 
accompanied by an audible signal 
and a message in the instrument 
panel screen, it indicates a fault with 
the anti-lock braking system which could result in 
loss of control of the vehicle when braking. 

 If this warning lamp comes on, 
together with the  ABS  warning 
lamp, accompanied by a message 
in the instrument panel screen, 
it indicates a fault with the electronic brake 
force distribution which could result in loss 
of control of the vehicle when braking. 
  You must stop as soon as it is safe to do so.  
 In either case, contact a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop.  

  For maximum braking efficiency, a 
bedding-in period of around 300 miles 

(500 kilometres) is needed. During this 
period it is recommended that you avoid 
harsh, repeated or prolonged braking.  

  Good practice 
 The ABS system does not provide shorter 
braking distances. On very slippery surfaces 
(black ice, oil...) the ABS can extend braking 
distances. For emergency braking, press the 
brake pedal hard and do not release it, even 
on a slipper surface; you will then be able to 
steer the vehicle and avoid an obstacle. 
 When replacing wheels (tyres and 
rims), ensure that they conform to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.   

   Driving safely   

        Emergency braking assistance 
 System which, in an emergency, enables 
you to obtain the optimum braking pressure 
more quickly, thus reducing the stopping 
distance.

  Operation 
 It is triggered by the speed at which the 
brake pedal is pressed. 
 The effect of this is a reduction in the 
resistance of the pedal and an increase in 
braking efficiency. 

 When braking in an emergency, press 
firmly without releasing the pressure.

       TRAJECTORY CONTROL SYSTEMS 

  Dynamic stability control (DSC) 

  The electronic stability programme acts on 
the brake of one or more wheels and on the 
engine to keep the vehicle on the trajectory 
required by the driver, within the limits of the 
laws of physics. 
 With the DSC system, maintain course 
without trying to countersteer.  

  Operation 
 The DSC system is activated automatically 
each time the vehicle is started. 

 It comes into operation in the 
event of a grip or trajectory 
problem. 

 This is indicated by flashing of this warning 
lamp in the instrument panel.  

  Anti-slip regulation (ASR) 
 Anti-slip regulation (also known as traction 
control) optimises traction, avoiding wheel 
spin by acting on the brakes of the driving 
wheels and the engine. 

  Operation 
 This system is activated automatically every 
time the vehicle is started. 
 In the event of a problem of adhesion or 
trajectory, this system comes into play.  

  Switching off 
 In exceptional conditions (starting a vehicle 
which is bogged down, stuck in snow, 
on soft ground...), it may be advisable to 
deactivate the ASR system, so that the 
wheels can spin freely and regain grip. 

  Switching off 
 This system cannot be deactivated by 
the driver.  

  Operating fault 

 Illumination of this warning lamp, 
accompanied by an audible signal 
and confirmed by a message 
in the instrument panel screen, 

indicates a fault with the DSC system. 
 Have it checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.   

   -   Press this button, located in the 

middle of the dashboard, to deactivate 
the system.  

 If the button's warning lamp comes 
on, accompanied by a message in the 
instrument panel screen, this indicates that 
the ASR system is deactivated.  

  Reactivation 
 The ASR system is reactivated automatically 
every time the ignition is switched back on. 
   -   Press this button again to reactivate it 

manually.   

  Operating fault 

 If this warning lamp comes on, 
accompanied by an audible signal 
and a message in the instrument 
panel screen, this indicates a fault 

with the ASR system. 
 Have it checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.  

  Good practice 
 The DSC and ASR systems offer exceptional 
safety in normal driving, but this should not 
encourage the driver to take extra risks or 
drive at high speed. 
 The correct operation of these systems 
depend on observation of the manufacturer's 
recommendations regarding the wheels 
(tyres and rims), the braking components, 
the electronic components and assembly 
and repair procedures. 
 After an impact, have these systems 
checked by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.   

  Load inertia control 
  The true total weight of a commercial vehicle 
can vary considerably depending on the load 
carried. As a result, the centre of gravity of 
the vehicle can move, both longitudinally 
and in height. 
 All such variations have an effect on braking, 
traction, the behaviour of the vehicle when 
cornering and the tendency to overturn.  

  Load inertia control estimates the true 
total weight of the vehicle by analysing its 
behaviour under acceleration and braking. 
 This system then adapts the operation of 
the DSC and ASR systems according to the 
weight distribution in the vehicle. In critical 
situations, your vehicle than remains more 
securely on its intended trajectory.   

   Driving safely

      Intelligent Traction Control 
 System to improve traction on slippery 
surfaces (snow, black ice, mud...) 
 This system checks for situations of difficult 
surface adhesion that could make it difficult 
to move off or make progress. 
 In these situations,  Intelligent Traction 
Control  takes over from the  ASR  system, 
by transferring drive to the wheel with the 
best grip on the ground to provide the best 
traction and trajectory control.

 CAB SEAT BELTS 
 The front seats are fitted with pre-tensioners 
and force limiters. 
 The bench rear seat is fitted with two seat 
belts. 
 If you install a bench seat after handover, it 
must be fitted with seat belts. 

  Fastening 
 Pull the strap in front of you, with an even 
movement, ensuring that it does not twist. 
 Secure the buckle in its housing. 
 Check that the seat belt is fastened securely 
and that the automatic locking system is 
operating correctly by pulling the strap 
rapidly.  

  Driver's seat belt not 
fastened warning lamp 

 When the vehicle is started, this warning 
lamp comes on if the driver has not fastened 
their seat belt.  

 CREW CAB 
 Each rear seat is fitted with a three-point 
inertia reel seat belt. 
 Use the seat belt to restrain one person only 
per seat. 

       If the driver's seat belt is unfastened, 
START mode of Stop & Start will not be 

invoked. Engine restarting is only possible 
with the ignition key.  

  Height adjustment 
 Squeeze the control with the return and slide 
the assembly on the driver's seat side and 
on the side passenger seat side. 
 The height of the seat belt associated with 
the centre seat cannot be adjusted.  

  Unfastening 
 Press the "red" button on the buckle 
housing, the seat belt rolls up automatically 
but you are advised to guide it.  

   As a safety precaution, these 
operations should not be carried out 
while the vehicle is moving.  

 REAR SEAT BELTS 
 The seats/bench seats are fitted with three-
point seat belts and inertia reels. 
 The centre seat has a seat belt guide and 
inertia reel, solid with the seat back. 

  Good practice 
 The driver must ensure that passengers 
use the seat belts correctly and that they 
are all strapped in securely before 
moving off. 
 Wherever you are seated in the vehicle, 
always fasten your seat belt, even for short 
journeys. 
 The seat belts are fitted with an inertia reel 
which automatically adjusts the length of the 
strap to your size. 
 Do not use accessories (clothes pegs, clips, 
safety pins, etc.) which allow the seat belt 
straps to fit loosely. 
 Ensure that the seat belt has reeled in 
correctly after use. 
 After folding or moving a seat or 
a rear bench seat, ensure that the seat 
belt has reeled in correctly and that 
the buckle is ready to accommodate 
the tongue. 
 Depending on the nature and seriousness of 
any impact, the pretensioning device may be 
deployed before and independently of inﬂ ation 
of the airbags. It instantly tightens the seat 
belts against the body of the occupants. 
 Deployment of the pretensioners is 
accompanied by a slight discharge of 
harmless smoke and a noise, due to the 
activation of the pyrotechnic cartridge 
incorporated in the system. 

 The force limiter reduces the pressure 
of the seat belt against the body of the 
occupants. 
 The pretensioning seat belts are active when 
the ignition is switched on. 
 The inertia reels are fitted with a device 
which automatically locks the strap in the 
event of a collision or emergency braking or 
if the vehicle rolls over. 
 You can unfasten the seat belt by pressing 
the red button on the buckle. Guide the seat 
belt after unfastening. 

 The airbag warning lamp also 
comes on if the pretensioners are 
deployed. Contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop. 

 In order to be effective, a seat belt: 
   -   must restrain one person only, 
  -   must not be twisted, check by pulling in 

front of you with an even movement, 

  -   must be tightened as close to the body 

as possible.  

 The upper part of the seat belt should be 
positioned in the hollow of the shoulder. 
 The lap part should be placed as low as 
possible on the pelvis. 

   Seat belts   
 Do not invert the seat belt buckles as they 
will not fulfil their role completely. If the 
seats are fitted with armrests, the lap part of 
the seat belt should always pass under the 
armrest. 
 Check that the seat belt is fastened correctly 
by pulling the strap firmly. 
  Recommendations for children 
 Use an appropriate child seat if the 
passenger is under 12 years or less than 
one and a half metres tall. 
 Never carry a child on your knees, even with 
the seat belt fastened. 

 For more information on child seats, 
refer to the "Safety - Children on board" 
section. 

 In accordance with current safety 
regulations, your CITROËN dealer can 
guarantee all work or any checks, from 
testing to maintenance, on your seat belt 
equipment. 
 Have the seat belts checked regularly (even 
after a minor impact) by a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop: they must not show 
any signs of wear, cutting or fraying and they 
must not be converted or modified. 

 Clean the seat belt straps with soapy 
water or a textile cleaning product, sold 
by CITROËN dealers.

  Impact resistance 
 Your vehicle has been designed to limit 
the forces on the passenger compartment 
as much as possible in the event of a 
collision, the engine compartment adopts 
a progressive deformation structure and 
the front doors have been reinforced to 
contribute to the rigidity of the whole.  

  Anti-theft protection 
 Your vehicle, in the van version, comprises 
two zones with separate locking: the cab 
and the load space. 
 Depending on the way in which it is used, 
this function provides increased protection 
both for your personal belongings and for 
your merchandise. 
 An exterior protection alarm with anti-tilt 
detection is available (as standard or as an 
option) in certain countries. 

 Details of these functions are given 
in the "Ready to go - Front and rear

deployed; the seat belts alone contribute 
towards providing protection in these 
situations.  

  Airbags only operate when the ignition is 
switched on.  

 Deployment of the airbags is 
accompanied by a slight discharge 
of smoke and a noise, resulting from the 
activation of the pyrotechnic charge included 
in the system. 
 This smoke is not harmful but may be an 
irritant to sensitive persons. 
 The noise of the detonation may result in a 
slight loss of hearing for a short time. 

  Front airbags 
 These are fitted in the centre of the steering 
wheel for the driver and in the dashboard 
for the front passenger. They are deployed, 
except the passenger's airbag if it has been

 GENERAL POINTS ON AIRBAGS 
 The airbags have been designed to optimise 
the safety of the occupants in the event of 
a serious collision; they work in conjunction 
with the force limiting seat belts. 
 In the event of a serious collision, electronic 
detectors record and analyse any abrupt 
deceleration of the vehicle: 
   -  

in the event of a serious collision, the 
airbags are deployed instantly and 
contribute towards better protection of 
occupants of the vehicle; immediately 
after the impact, the airbags rapidly 
deflate so as to not hinder visibility or 
the possible exit by the occupants, 
in the event of a less serious impact, 
an impact to the rear and in certain 
conditions of rollover, the airbags are not 

  -  

 When  OFF  is selected, the passenger's front 
airbag will not be triggered in the event of an 
impact. 
 As soon as the child seat is removed, select  ON  to 
re-activate the airbag and thus ensure the safety 
of your passenger in the event of an impact. 

  Deactivation check 

 This is confirmed by the 
illumination of this warning lamp, 
accompanied by a message in 
the display screen, every time the 
engine is started.   

  Lateral airbags and curtain airbags 
 If your vehicle is fitted with lateral airbags, 
these are fitted to the front seat backs on 
the door side. 
 The curtain airbags are fitted to the door 
pillars and the upper part of the passenger 
compartment, in the roof over the front cab 
seats. 
 They inflate between the occupant and the 
glazed area. 
 They are deployed independently of each 
other depending on which side the collision 
occurs. 

  Operating fault 

 If this warning lamp comes on, 
contact a CITROËN dealer to 
have the vehicle checked.

  Deactivating the passenger's front 
airbag 
 The setting is made using the " MODE " 
button: in the "Passenger airbag" menu, 
select " OFF ". 

 Refer to the "Technology on board - 
Vehicle configuration" section. 

 To ensure the safety of your child, it is 
essential to deactivate the passenger's 

front airbag when you install a rearward 
facing child seat on the front passenger 
seat. Otherwise, the child would risk being 
killed or seriously injured if the airbag were 
to inflate. 
 If your vehicle is not fitted with this facility: 
do not install a rearward facing child seat. 

  Good practice 
  If your vehicle is fitted with front, lateral 
and curtain airbags, in order for these to 
be fully effective, observe the following 
safety rules:  

 Wear a correctly adjusted seat belt. 
 Sit in a normal upright position. 
 Do not leave anything between the 
occupants and the airbags (child, animal, 
object...). 
 This could hamper the operation of the 
airbags or injure the occupants. 
 All work on the airbag systems must be 
carried out by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop. 
 After an accident or if the vehicle has been 
stolen or broken into, have the airbag 
systems checked.  

  Front airbags 
 Do not drive holding the steering wheel 
by its spokes or resting your hands on the 
centre part of the wheel. 
 Passengers must not place their feet on the 
dashboard. 
 Smoke as little as possible; deployment of 
the airbags can cause burns or the risk of 
injury from a cigarette or pipe. 
 Never remove or pierce the steering wheel 
or hit it violently.  

  Lateral airbags 
 Fit only approved covers on the front seats, 
compatible with the deployment of lateral 
airbags. For information on the range of 
covers suitable for your vehicle, contact a 
CITROËN dealer. 
 Do not fix or attach anything to the front seat 
backs. This could cause injury to the chest 
or arms when the lateral airbag is deployed. 
 Do not sit with the upper part of the body 
any nearer to the door than necessary.  

   Airbags   

  Curtain airbags 
 Do not fix or attach anything to the pillars or 
the roof. This could cause injury to the head 
when the curtain airbag is deployed. 
 Do not remove the bolts from the grab 
handles installed on the roof, they play a 
part in securing the curtain airbags.

   Child safety   
 GENERAL POINTS ON CHILD 
SEATS 
  Although one of CITROËN's main criteria 
when designing your vehicle, the safety of 
your children also depends on you. 
 For maximum safety, please follow these 
precautions: 
   -  

all children under the age of 12 or less 
than one metre fifty tall must travel in 
approved child seats suited to their 
weight, on seats fitted with a seat belt or 
ISOFIX mountings, 
statistically, the safest seats in your 
vehicle for the transportation of children 
are the rear seats, 
a child weighing less than 9 kg must 
travel in the "rearward facing" position 
both in the front and in the rear, 
the passenger must not travel with a 
child on their lap.   

  -  

  -  

  -  

            CITROËN recommends  that children 
should travel on the  rear seats  of 

your vehicle: 
   -  
  -  

 "rearward-facing"  up to the age of 3, 
 "forward-facing"  over the age of 3.    

  Installing a child seat at the front 

  "Rearward facing" 
 When a "rearward facing" child 
seat is installed on the front 
passenger seat, it is essential 

that the passenger's front airbag is 
deactivated. Otherwise, the child would risk 
being seriously injured or even killed if the 
airbag were deployed.  

  "Forward facing" 
  When a "forward facing" 
child seat is installed on the 
front passenger seat, leave 
the passenger's front airbag 
activated.   

  The child seats function and the 
passenger's front airbag deactivation 

function are common to the entire CITROËN 
range. 
 If the passenger's front airbag is not 
deactivated, the installation of a "rearward 
facing" child seat in the front is strictly 
prohibited.

  "Rearward facing" 
 When a "rearward facing" child 
seat is installed  on a rear 
passenger seat , move the 

vehicle's front seat forwards and straighten 
the backrest so that the "rearward facing" 
child seat does not touch the vehicle's front 
seat.  

  "Forward facing" 
 When a "forward facing" child 
seat is installed  on a rear 
passenger seat , move the 

vehicle's front seat forwards and straighten 
the backrest so that the legs of the child in 
the "forward facing" child seat do not touch 
the vehicle's front seat.  

  Ensure that the seat belt is correctly 
tensioned. 

 For child seats with a support leg, ensure 
that this is in firm contact with the floor. 
If necessary, adjust the front seat of 
the vehicle.   

  Never install a "rearward facing" child 
restraint system on a seat protected by 
an active front airbag. This could cause the 
death of the child or serious injury to them.  

  The warning label on both sides of the 
passenger's sun visor repeats this warning. 
As required by current legislation, the 
following tables present the warning in all of 
the languages needed.  

  The rules for carrying children are 
specific to each country. Consult the 

current legislation in your country. 
 Please consult the list of seats approved 
in your country. The Isofix mountings, the 
rear seats, the passenger airbag and the 
deactivation of this airbag depend on the 
version sold.  

  If your vehicle is fitted with this function, the 
passenger's front airbag setting must be 
adjusted using the  MODE  button.

 "ISOFIX" MOUNTINGS 
 Your vehicle has been approved 
to the latest ISOFIX regulation. 

 If fitted on your vehicle, the regulation 
ISOFIX mountings are located by labels. 

 The mountings comprise three rings for each 
seat: 
   -  

two front rings, located between the 
vehicle seat back and cushion, indicated 
by a label, 
a rear ring, for securing the upper 
strap referred to as the TOP TETHER, 
indicated by another label.  

  -  

 This ISOFIX mounting system provides fast, 
reliable and safe fitting of the child seat in 
your vehicle. 
 The ISOFIX child seats are fitted with two 
latches which are secured easily on the two 
front rings. 
 Some also have an upper strap which is 
attached to the rear ring. 
 To attach this strap, remove and stow the 
head restraint before installing the child seat 
at the seating position (refit it once the child 
seat has been removed). Then fix the hook 
on the rear ring and tighten the upper strap. 

 The incorrect installation of a child seat 
in a vehicle compromises the child's 

protection in the event of an accident. 
 For information on the possibilities for fitting 
ISOFIX child seats to your vehicle, refer to 
the summary table for the location of the 
ISOFIX child seats. 

 LOCATIONS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF ISOFIX CHILD SEATS 
 In accordance with European regulations, this table indicates the options for the installation of ISOFIX child seats on the vehicle seats fitted 
with ISOFIX mountings. 
 In the case of the universal and semi-universal ISOFIX child seats, the child seat's ISOFIX size category, determined by a letter from  A  to  G , 
is indicated on the child seat next to the ISOFIX logo.

 ADVICE ON CHILD SEATS 
 The incorrect installation of a child seat in a 
vehicle compromises the child's protection in 
the event of an accident. 
 Check that there is no seat belt or seat belt 
buckle under the child seat, as this could 
destabilise the seat. 
 Remember to fasten the seat belts or the 
child seat harnesses  keeping the slack  in 
relation to the child's body  to a minimum , 
even for short journeys. 
 For the installation of a child seat using 
the seat belt, ensure that the seat belt is 
well tensioned on the child seat and that 
it is holding the child seat firmly against 
the vehicle's seat. If the passenger seat is 
adjustable, move it forward if necessary. 

 At the rear, always leave sufficient space 
between the front seat and: 
   -  
  -  

a "rearward facing" child seat, 
the feet of a child seated in a "forward 
facing" child seat.  

 For this, move the front seat forward and, if 
necessary, straighten its backrest as well. 

 For the optimum installation of a "forward 
facing" child seat, ensure that the back of 
the child seat is as close as possible to the 
backrest of the vehicle's seat, or in contact 
if possible. 
 The head restraint must be removed before 
installing a child seat with a backrest on the 
passenger seat. 
 Ensure that the head restraint is stowed or 
attached securely so that it is not thrown 
around the vehicle in the event of sharp 
braking. 
 Refit the head restraint as soon as the child 
seat is removed. 

  Children at the front 
 The legislation on carrying a child on the 
front passenger seat is specific to each 
country. Refer to the legislation in force in 
your country. 
 Deactivate the passenger's airbag when a 
"rearward facing" child seat is installed on 
the front seat. 
 Otherwise, the child would risk being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag were 
deployed.  

  Crew cab 
 Do not install child seats, booster cushions 
or carrycots on the rear seats of the cab.  

5

   Child safety   

  Installing a booster seat 
 The chest part of the seat belt must be 
positioned on the child's shoulder without 
touching the neck. 
 Ensure that the lap part of the seat belt 
passes correctly over the child's thighs. 
 CITROËN recommends the use of a booster 
seat which has a back, fitted with a seat belt 
guide at shoulder level.  

  -  

  As a safety precaution, do not leave: 
one or more children alone and 
   -  
unsupervised in a vehicle, 
a child or an animal in a vehicle which 
is exposed to the sun, with the windows 
closed, 
the keys within reach of children inside 
the vehicle.  

  -  

 To prevent accidental opening of the doors, 
use the "Child Lock". 
 Take care not to open the rear windows by 
more than one third. 
 To protect young children from the rays of 
the sun, fit side blinds to the rear windows.

 TOWING A TRAILER... 

 The type-approved towable weights are 
entered in your vehicle's registration 
certificate, as well as on the manufacturer's 
VIN plate. 

 Refer to the "Technical data - Vehicle 
identification" section. 

 These weights are also given in sales 
brochures. 

 For the maximum unbraked trailer 
weight and the recommended nose 

weight, refer to the "Technical data - 
Weights" section. 

 You will then have information on your 
vehicle's ability to tow a trailer, a caravan, a 
boat... 

  Driving advice 
 A towed vehicle must free wheel: gearbox in 
neutral. 

  Distribution of loads:  distribute the load in 
the trailer so that the heaviest objects are as 
close as possible to the axle and the nose 
weight is close to the maximum authorised 
without, however, exceeding it. 

  Good practice 
 In certain cases of particularly arduous 
use (towing the maximum load up a steep 
slope in high temperatures), the engine 
automatically limits its power. In this 
case, the automatic cutting off of the air 
conditioning allows the engine power to be 
recovered. 

   Transport solutions   

  Side wind:  sensitivity to side wind is 
increased. Drive smoothly and at a 
moderate speed. 

7
1
1

 

  ABS:  the system only controls the vehicle, 
not the trailer. 

  Rear parking sensors:  the system does not 
operate while the vehicle is towing.  

  Cooling:  towing a trailer on a slope 
increases the coolant temperature. 
 As the fan is electrically controlled, its 
cooling capacity is not dependent on the 
engine speed. 
 On the contrary, use a high gear to lower the 
engine speed and reduce your speed. 
 In all cases, pay attention to the coolant 
temperature.  

 If the coolant temperature 
warning lamp comes on, stop the 
vehicle and switch off the engine 
as soon as possible. 

 Refer to the "Checks - Levels and 
checks" section. 

  Tyres:  check the tyre pressures of the 
towing vehicle and of the trailer, observing 
the recommended pressures. 

 Refer to the "Technical data - 
Identification markings" section. 

  Brakes:  towing increases the braking 
distance. Drive at a moderate speed, 
change down early and brake gradually. 

  Fitting a towbar 
 We recommend the use of genuine 
CITROËN towbars and their harnesses, 
which have been tested and approved from 
the design stage of your vehicle and that 
the fitting of this equipment is entrusted to a 
CITROËN dealer. 
 These genuine towbars are compatible with 
the operation of the rear parking sensors 
and the reversing camera, if fitted to your 
vehicle. 
 If this equipment is not fitted by a CITROËN 
dealer, it must be fitted in line with the 
manufacturer's instructions.

 TOWBAR WITH QUICKLY 
DETACHABLE TOW BALL  
  This tow ball can be fitted and removed 
quickly and easily without the use of tools.  

  When not towing a trailer, remove the 
quickly-detachable tow ball before driving.  

   Never exceed the maximum authorised 
weight for the vehicle plus trailer 
(Gross Train Weight - GTW). 

 For information on the maximum 
trailer weight and the recommended 
nose weight, refer to the "Technical data - 
Weights" section.   

 The carrying system must always be 
secured to the fitting points provided on the 
vehicle's roof: 6, 8 or 10, depending on the 
wheelbase of the vehicle. 
 Observe the instructions for fitting and use 
provided with the carrying system. 

  Maximum load on the roof, evenly 
distributed: 150 kg, for all versions, 

within the vehicle's weight limit (Gross 
Vehicle Weight). 

 Observe in full the legal requirements 
related to carrying outsized loads.  

  Refer to the "Technical data - 
"Dimensions" section for more 

information on the length (L1 to L4) and the 
height (H1 to H3) of the vehicle.   

 ROOF CARRYING SYSTEMS 

  For reasons of safety and to avoid damaging 
the roof, it is essential to use a carrying 
system (roof bars or roof rack) that is 
approved for your vehicle. 
 Roof bars can only be fitted to H1 height 
van, combi and minibus versions. On a 
minibus, check for the presence of roof air 
conditioning units.

SNOW CHAINS 

  In wintry conditions, snow chains improve 
traction as well as the behaviour of the 
vehicle when braking. 

   Use only the chains designed to be fitted to 
the type of wheel fitted to your vehicle: 

  The snow chains must be fitted only to 
the driving wheels. They must never be 

fitted to "space-saver" type spare wheels.  

  Take account of the legislation in force 
in your country on the use of snow 
chains and the maximum running speed 
authorised.

  Advice on installation 
     

If you have to fit the chains during 
a journey, stop the vehicle on a flat 
surface on the side of the road. 

     Apply the parking brake and position any 

wheel chocks to prevent movement of 
your vehicle. 

     Fit the chains following the instructions 

provided by the manufacturer. 

     Move off gently and drive for a few 

moments, without exceeding 30 mph 
(50 km/h). 

     Stop your vehicle and check that the 
snow chains are correctly tightened.   

  Avoid driving on roads that have been 
cleared of snow, to avoid damaging 

your vehicle's tyres and the road surface. It 
is recommended that before you leave, you 
practise fitting the snow chains on a level 
and dry surface. If your vehicle is fitted with 
alloy wheels, check that no part of the chain 
or its fixings is in contact with the wheel rim.

 LEVELS 

 These regular maintenance operations 
will keep your vehicle in good running 
order. Ask for advice at a CITROËN dealer 
or consult the maintenance and warranty 
guide contained in the handbook pack. 

 If you have to remove/refit the 
engine styling cover, handle it 

with care to avoid damaging the 
fixing clips. 
        Used products 
 Avoid prolonged contact of used oil or fluids 
with the skin. 
 Most of these fluids are harmful to health or 
indeed very corrosive. 
 Do not discard used oil or fluids into sewers 
or onto the ground. 
 Take used oil to a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop (France) or to an 
authorised waste disposal site.  

  Oil level 
 Check the level regularly and top up 
between changes. The maximum 
consumption is 0.5 litre per 600 miles 
(1 000 km). Check the level with the vehicle 
level, engine cold, using the dipstick. 

  Dipstick 
 There are two marks on 
the dipstick: 
  A  = maximum 
 If you fill past this mark, 
contact a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop. 
  B  = minimum 
 Never allow the level to fall 
below this mark. 

 To maintain the reliability of engines and 
emission control systems, the use of 
additives in engine oil is prohibited.  

  Oil change 
 It is imperative that this is carried out at the 
intervals specified in the manufacturer's 
servicing schedule. Ask for advice at at 
CITROËN dealer. 
 Remove the dipstick before filling. 
 Check the level after filling (never exceed 
the maximum mark). 
 Screw the cap back onto the sump before 
closing the bonnet.  

  Viscosity selection 
 When topping-up, the oil selected must meet 
the manufacturer's requirements.   

  Changing the brake fluid 
 The brake fluid must be changed at 
the intervals stated, according to the 
manufacturer's servicing schedule. 
 Use fluids recommended by the 
manufacturer, which fulfil DOT4 standards. 
 The level must be between the  MIN  and 
 MAX  marks on the reservoir. 
 If fluid has to be added frequently, this 
indicates a failure which must be checked by 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop 
as soon as possible.  

  Warning lamps 

  Checking by means of the warning 
lamps on the instrument panel is 
described in the "Ready to go - 
Instruments and controls" section.  

 For access to the header tank filler cap, 
remove the protective cover by removing its 
three fixing screws. 
 If fluid has to be added frequently, this 
indicates a failure which must be checked by 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop 
as soon as possible. 

  Topping up 
 The level must be between the  MIN  and 
 MAX  marks on the expansion bottle. If 
more than 1 litre of fluid is required to top 
up the level, have the system checked by a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.   

  Power steering fluid level 
 The vehicle must be parked on level ground 
with the engine cold. Unscrew the cap 
integrated with the gauge and check the 
level which must be between the  MIN  and 
 MAX  marks. 
 For access to the reservoir filler cap, remove 
the protective cover by removing its three 
fixing screws, then remove the second cover 
fitted to the cap.

  Cooling system 
 Only use the fluid recommended by the 
manufacturer. Otherwise, you risk seriously 
damaging your engine. When the engine 
is warm, the temperature of the coolant is 
controlled by the engine fan. As this fan can 
operate with the ignition key removed and 
because the cooling system is pressurised, 
wait for at least one hour after the engine 
has stopped before carrying out any work. 
 Slacken the cap by 1/4 of a turn to release 
the pressure to prevent any risk of scalding. 
When the pressure has dropped, remove the 
cap and top up the level with coolant.

 CHECKS 

 These operations will keep your vehicle 
in good running order. Ask for advice 

from a CITROËN dealer or refer to the 
maintenance and warranty guide included in 
the handbook pack. 

  Battery 
 At the start of winter, have your battery 
checked by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.  

  Bleeding water from the Diesel 
filter 

 If this warning lamp comes on, 
bleed the filter, or bleed regularly 
each time the engine oil is 
changed. 

 To drain the water out, unscrew the bleed 
screw or the water in Diesel sensor, located 
at the base of the filter. Leave open until 
all of the water has been drained out. Then 
tighten the bleed screw or the water sensor. 

 HDi engines use advanced technology. 
All work requires a special qualification 

which is guaranteed by a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop.  

  Air filter and passenger 
compartment filter 
 A clogged passenger compartment filter 
may reduce the performance of the 
air conditioning system and generate 
undesirable odours. The replacement 
intervals for these components are given in 
the maintenance and warranty guide. 
 Depending on the environment (dusty 
atmosphere...) and the use of the vehicle 
(urban driving...), change them twice as 
often if necessary. 

 Refer to the "Checks - Under the 
bonnet" section.  

       The presence of this label, in particular 
with the Stop & Start system, indicates the 
use of a specific 12 V lead-acid battery 
with special technology and specification. 
The involvement of a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop is essential when 
replacing or disconnecting the battery.  

  Oil filter 
 Change the filter regularly, in accordance 
with the manufacturer's servicing schedule.  

  Brake disc/drum wear status 
 For any information relating to checking 
the brake disc/drum wear status, contact a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.  

  Brake pads 
 Brake pad wear depends on the style of 
driving, in particular for vehicles which are 
used in town, over short distances. It may 
be necessary to check the thickness of the 
pads, even between services. 

 If this warning lamp comes on, 
have the brake pad wear checked 
by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.  

  Parking brake 
 Where the parking brake travel is too great 
or there is a reduction in the performance 
of the system, the parking brake should be 
adjusted, even between services. 
 Have the system checked by a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.  

  Manual gearbox 
 Have the level checked in accordance with 
the manufacturer's servicing schedule.

   Levels and checks   

  Good practice 
 To check the main levels and certain 
components, in accordance with the 
manufacturer's servicing schedule, refer to 
the pages of the maintenance and warranty 
guide which correspond to your vehicle's 
engine. 
 Only use products recommended by 
CITROËN or products of equivalent quality 
and specification. 
 In order to optimise the operation of units as 
important as the braking system, CITROËN 
selects and offers specific products. 

 In order to avoid damaging the 
electrical units, high pressure washing 
to clean the engine compartment is strictly 
prohibited. 
 After washing the vehicle dampness, or in 
winter, ice may form on the brake discs and 
pads: braking efficiency may be reduced. 
Make some light brake applications to dry 
and de-ice the brakes.

   Levels and checks   
        Particle filter system (Diesel) 
 An addition to the catalytic converter, this 
filter makes an active contribution to the 
preservation of air quality by the retaining 
of the unburnt pollutant particles. Black 
exhaust fumes are thus no longer emitted. 

  Operation 
 This filter, fitted to the exhaust system, 
accumulates particles of soot. The engine 
management unit controls the automatic 
periodic elimination of the soot particles 
(regeneration). 
 The regeneration procedure is invoked 
according to the quantity of particles 
accumulated and the driving conditions 
of the vehicle. During this phase, you 
may notice some unusual phenomena - 
increased idling speed, cooling fan running, 
increase in smoke and higher exhaust gas 
temperature - which does not affect the 
operation of the vehicle or the environment.  

  After prolonged idling or driving at very 
low speeds, you may occasionally 

notice water vapour being emitted from the 
exhaust when accelerating. This is of no 
consequence to the running of the vehicle or 
to the environment.  

  Because of the higher exhaust 
gas temperature resulting from the 
normal operation of the particle filter, it is 
recommended that you do not park the 
vehicle over inflammable materials (grass, 
dry leaves, pine needles, ...) so as to avoid 
any risk of fire.  

  Saturation / Regeneration 

 If there is risk of blockage of the 
filter, this warning lamp comes on 
in the instrument panel. 

 This alert tells you that the particle filter 
is starting to fill up (in conditions of urban 
driving of exceptionally long duration: low 
speeds, traffic jams etc.) 

 To regenerate the filter, it is advised to drive 
as soon as possible, when traffic conditions 
and the law permit, at a speed of at least 
40 mph (around 60 km/h), with an engine 
speed above 2 000 rpm for about fifteen 
minutes (until the warning lamp and/or the 
message disappears). 
 If possible, avoid switching off the engine 
before the end of regeneration of the 
filter; repeated interruptions could cause 
premature deterioration of the engine oil. It 
is not recommended to end regeneration of 
the filter with the vehicle stationary.  

  Operating fault 
 If this alert persists, do not ignore the 
warning; it indicates that a fault has occurred 
in the exhaust / particle filter system. 
 Have the whole system checked by a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.   

  Low fuel level 

 When the fuel tank level  E  
(Empty) is reached, this warning 
lamp comes on. At this moment, 
you have  around 10 to 12 litres  

in the reserve, depending on the capacity 
of the tank, the engine type, the driving 
conditions and the profile of the road. Refuel 
without delay to avoid running out of fuel. 
 The capacity of the fuel tank is 
approximately  90  litres. 
 Fuel tanks of different capacities, 60 and 
125 litres, may be fitted.

   Fuel   

 The fuel tank must be filled  with the 
engine off.  
   -   Open the fuel filler flap. 
  -   Support the cap with one hand. 
  -   With the other hand, insert the key, then 

turn it anticlockwise. 

  -   Remove the cap and hook it onto the 
clip located on the inside of the flap.  

 A label affixed to the inside of the flap 
reminds you of the type of fuel to be used. 
 When filling the fuel tank, do not continue 
after the 3rd cut-off of the nozzle. This could 
cause malfunctions. 
   -   After filling the fuel tank, lock the cap 

and close the flap.

 REFUELLING 

       With Stop & Start, never refuel 
with the system in STOP mode; 
you must switch off the ignition with 
the key.  

   In low temperatures 
 In mountainous and/or cold areas, it is 
advisable to use a "winter" type fuel suited 
to low or minus temperatures.

   Discharged battery   

  The charging operation must be carried 
out in a ventilated area away from 
naked flames or any possible sources of 
sparks to eliminate the risk of explosion 
and fire. 
 Do not attempt to charge a frozen battery: it 
must first be thawed to eliminate the risks of 
explosion. If the battery has frozen, before 
charging it have it checked by a specialist 
who will check that the internal components 
have not been damaged and that the 
container is not cracked, which could mean 
that there is a risk of a leak of toxic and 
corrosive acid. 
 Proceed with a slow charge charge at low 
current for a maximum pf about 24 hours to 
avoid damaging the battery.   

  The batteries contain harmful 
substances such as sulphuric acid and 
lead. They must be discarded in accordance 
with the provisions of the law and must not, 
in any circumstances, be discarded with 
household waste. 
 Take used batteries to a special collection 
point.  

  Before disconnecting the battery, you must 
wait for 2 minutes after switching off the 
ignition. 
 Never disconnect a terminal when the 
engine is running. 
 Never charge a battery without first 
disconnecting the terminals. 
 Close the windows and doors before 
disconnecting the battery. 
 After every reconnection of the battery, 
switch on the ignition and wait 1 minute 
before starting to allow the electronic 
systems to be initialised. If slight difficulties 
are experienced after this, please contact a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.  

  Access to the battery 
 Unscrew the 6 access cover retaining 
screws. 
 Lift off or remove completely the access 
cover. 
 Press lever  1  downwards to spread the 
clamp. 
 Remove the terminal  2  from the negative (-) 
post.   

  It is advisable to disconnect the

  If the battery has been disconnected 
for some time, it may be necessary to 
reinitialise the following functions: 
   -  

the display parameters (date, time, 
language, distance unit and temperature 
unit), 
the radio stations, 
the central locking.  

  -  
  -  
 Some settings are cleared and must be 
reprogrammed, consult a CITROËN. 
 If your vehicle is fitted with a tachograph or 
an alarm, disconnection of the negative (-) 
terminal of the battery (located under the 
floor on the left-hand side, in the cab) is 
recommended if the vehicle is not to be used 
for a period of more than 5 days.   

       The presence of this label, in particular 
with the Stop & Start system, indicates 

the use of a 12 V lead-acid battery with 
special technology and specification; 
the involvement of a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop is essential when 
replacing or disconnecting the battery. 
 Failure to observe this recommendation may 
cause premature wear of the battery.  

  After reﬁ tting the battery by a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualiﬁ ed workshop, the 

Stop & Start system will only be active after 
a continuous period of immobilisation of 
the vehicle, a period which depends on the 
climatic conditions and the state of charge of 
the battery (up to about 8 hours).  

  Do not disconnect the battery to 
charge it.

 PUNCTURE REPAIR KIT 
 This temporary puncture repair kit is located 
at the front of the passenger compartment. 
 It consists of: 
   -  

a cartridge  A , containing the sealant 
fluid, equipped with: 
   ●   a filling hose  B , 
  ●   a sticker  C  indicating "max. 80 km/h", 
which the driver must affix in full view 
(on the dashboard) after repairing the 
tyre,  

  -  
  -  

  -  

a quick guide to use of the repair kit, 
a compressor  D  equipped with a 
pressure gauge and unions, 
adaptors, for the inflation of various 
items.  

  Repairing the tyre 
   -   Apply the parking brake. Unscrew the 

tyre valve cap, remove the filling hose  B  
and screw the ring  E  onto the valve, 

  -  

check that the switch  F  on the 
compressor is in position 0 (off), 

  -  

  -  
  -  

start the engine, 
insert the connector  G  into the nearest 
power socket on the vehicle, 
switch on the compressor by placing the 
switch  F  in position  I  (on), 
  -  
inflate the tyre to a pressure of 4 bars.  
 To obtain a more accurate reading, you are 
advised to check the pressure value on the 
pressure gauge  H , with the compressor off. 

   -  

  -  

If a pressure of at least  3 bars  is not 
reached within 5 minutes, disconnect 
the compressor from the valve and the 
power socket, then move the vehicle 
forward by approximately 10 metres 
to distribute the sealant fluid inside 
the tyre. 
Then repeat the inflating operation: 
   ●   if a pressure of at least  3 bars  is not 
reached within 10 minutes, switch off 
your vehicle: the tyre has suffered 
too much damage and repair has not 
been possible.Contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop. 
  ●   if the tyre has been inflated to a 
pressure of  4 bars , set off again 
immediately.   

 After driving for approximately 10 minutes, 
stop and check the pressure of the tyre 
again. 
 Adjust the pressure if necessary and contact 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop 
as soon as possible.  

  Checking and adjusting 
the pressure 
 The compressor can only be used to check 
and adjust the pressure. 
   -   Disconnect the hose  I  and connect it to 
the tyre valve directly; the cartridge will 
then be connected to the compressor 
and the filling fluid will not be injected.  

 If it is necessary to deflate the tyre, connect 
the hose  I  to the tyre valve and press the 
yellow button, placed in the centre of the 
switch on the compressor.

  Replacing the cartridge 
 To replace the sealant cartridge, carry out 
the following operations: 
   -  
  -  

disconnect the hose  I , 
turn the cartridge to be replaced 
anticlockwise and lift it, 
insert the new cartridge and turn it 
clockwise, 
reconnect the hose  I  and connect the 
hose  B  in its location.   
  The cartridge contains ethylene-glycol, a 
product which is harmful if swallowed and 

  -  

  -  

which causes irritation to the eyes. 
 Keep out of reach of children. 
 After use, do not discard the cartridge in the 
environment, take it to a CITROËN dealer or an 
appropriate waste disposal organisation. 
 This puncture repair kit and replacement 
cartridges are available from CITROËN dealers.

          Quality of the fuel used for Diesel engines 
  The Diesel engines are perfectly compatible with biofuels which conform to current and future European standards (Diesel fuel which 
complies with standard EN 590 mixed with a biofuel which complies with standard EN 14214) available at the pumps (containing up to 5% 
Fatty Acid Methyl Ester). 
 The B30 biofuel can be used in certain Diesel engines; however, this use is subject to strict application of the special servicing conditions 
given in the maintenance and warranty guide. Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop. 
 The use of any other type of (bio)fuel (vegetable or animal oils, pure or diluted, domestic fuel...) is strictly prohibited (risk of damage to the 
engine and fuel system).

 WEIGHTS AND TOWED LOADS 
 Refer to your registration certificate and the vehicle's chassis plate. 
 In each country, it is imperative that the towed loads permitted by local legislation are complied with. For information regarding your 
vehicle's towing possibilities and its gross train weight, contact a CITROËN dealer. 
 The speed of a towing vehicle must not exceed 60 mph (100 km/h) (comply with the legislation in force in your country). 
 High ambient temperatures may result in a reduction in the performance of the vehicle, to protect the engine. When the ambient 
temperature is higher than 37 °C, limit the weight towed. 
 These tables present the type-approved weights (in kg) according to the vehicle model and dimensions.

  Select " 
and search for the name of the system in the 
telephone (otherwise selecting "No", the main 
Telephone screen page is displayed).  

  For reasons of safety and because they require prolonged attention 
on the part of the driver, the operations for pairing a Bluetooth mobile 
telephone to the hands-free system of the audio system must be 
carried out with the  vehicle stationary .  

  When pairing, a screen page is displayed showing progress in the 
operation.  

  If the operation fails, we recommend switching 
the Bluetooth function of your telephone off and 
then on again.  

  When the pairing procedure has ﬁ nished 
successfully, a screen page appears: 
 Reply "Yes" to the question, the mobile phone 
is saved as the favourite (this telephone will 
have priority over other telephones paired 
subsequently). 
 If no other device has been paired, the system 
considers the ﬁ rst device paired to be the 
favourite.  

  Using the telephone's keypad, enter the PIN 
displayed in the screen of the system or conﬁ rm 
in the telephone the PIN displayed.  

  For telephones not set as favourite, the order of priority is 
determined in the order of connection. The last telephone connected 
has the highest priority.

      Information - Using the system 

  Instead of touching the screen, you can use your voice to issue 
commands to the system.  

  To ensure that your voice commands are always recognised by the 
system, we recommend that you follow the advice below: 
   -  
  -  
  -  

speak with a normal tone of voice, 
before speaking, always wait for the "beep" (audible signal), 
the system is able to recognise the voice commands delivered, 
independent off gender, tone and inﬂ exion of the voice of the 
person speaking, 
keep the noise level inside the vehicle as low as possible, 
before speaking a voice command, ask other passengers not to 
speak. As the system recognizes voice commands whatever is 
said, when more than one person speaks at the same time, it is 
possible that the system will recognise commands different or 
additional to the one intended, 
for best operation, it is recommended that the windows and 
opening roof (for versions/markets where it is available) be 
closed to avoid interference from extraneous noises.

      Steering mounted controls 

  This button switches on the "Telephone" voice 
recognition mode, which makes it possible 
to start calls, view the log of recent/received/
made, display contacts, etc.  

  This button switches on the "Radio/Media" 
voice recognition mode, which makes it 
possible to tune to a speciﬁ c radio station radio 
or speciﬁ c AF/FM radio frequency, play a track 
or an album on a USB memory stick/iPod/MP3 
CD.  

  Voice interaction can be quickly used if these buttons are pressed 
during a voice message from the system, it allows a voice command 
to be issued directly. 
 For example, if the system is speaking a voice help message and 
if you want to know the command to give the system, by pressing 
these buttons, the voice message is interrupted and the desired 
voice command can be spoken directly (so avoiding the need to 
listed to the complete voice help message). 
 When the system is waiting for a voice command from the user, 
pressing these buttons closes the voice session.  

  Every time a button is pressed, a "beep" (audible signal) is produced 
and the screen displays a page of suggestions asking the user to 
speak a command.

  RDS 

Receiving TA messages 

  RDS, if displayed, makes it possible to continue listening to the 
same radio station using the alternative frequencies function. 
However, in certain conditions it may not be possible to stay with the 
same station as not all radio stations cover the entire country. When 
reception is poor the system switches to a regional frequency.  

  Press the  MENU  button.  

  The TA (Trafﬁ c Announcement) function gives priority to playing TA 
alert messages. To be active, this function requires good reception 
of a radio station that broadcasts this type of message. As soon 
as trafﬁ c information is broadcast, the media playing is interrupted 
automatically to transmit the TA message. Normal play of the media 
is restored after transmission of the message.  

  Select " Regional " then press to switch RDS on 
or off.   

  Press the " MENU " button.

  Voice interaction can be quickly used if these buttons are pressed 
during a voice message from the system, it allows a voice command 
to be issued directly. 
 For example, if the system is speaking a voice help message and 
if you want to know the command to give the system, by pressing 
these buttons, the voice message is interrupted and the desired 
voice command can be spoken directly (so avoiding the need to 
listed to the complete voice help message). 
 When the system is waiting for a voice command from the user, 
pressing these buttons closes the voice session.  

  Every time a button is pressed, a "beep" (audible signal) is produced 
and the screen displays a page of suggestions asking the user to 
speak a command.
