Beyond the warning required by
ECE R94.02, for safety reasons a
forward-facing child restraint system
must only be used subject to the
instructions and restrictions in the
tables 3 52.
The airbag label is located on both
sides of the front passenger sun visor.
Airbag deactivation 3 49.

Front airbag system
The front airbag system consists of
one airbag in the steering wheel and
one in the instrument panel on the
front passenger side. The location is
identified by the word AIRBAG.

48

Seats, restraints

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and head of
the front seat occupants
considerably.

9 Warning

Optimum protection is only
provided when the seat is in the
proper position.
Seat position 3 37.
Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
Fit the seat belt correctly and
engage securely. Only then is the
airbag able to protect.

Side airbag system

The side airbag system consists of an
airbag in each front seat backrest.
The location is identified by the word
AIRBAG.
The side airbag system is triggered in
the event of a side impact of a certain
severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and pelvis in
the event of a side-on collision
considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Note
Only use protective seat covers that
have been approved for the vehicle.
Be careful not to cover the airbags.

Curtain airbag system
The curtain airbag system consists of
an airbag in the roof frame on each
side. The location is identified by the
word AIRBAG on the roof pillars.
The curtain airbag system is triggered
in the event of a side-on impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the head in the event of a
side-on impact considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
The hooks on the handles in the
roof frame are only suitable for
hanging up light articles of
clothing, without coat hangers. Do
not keep any items in these
clothes.
Airbag deactivation
The front passenger airbag system
must be deactivated for child restraint
system on the passenger seat
according to the instructions in the
tables 3 52.
The other airbag systems, the belt
pretensioners and all driver airbag
systems will remain active.

Seats, restraints

49

Use the ignition key to choose the
switch position:
*OFF = front passenger airbag is
deactivated and will not
inflate in the event of a
collision. Control indicator
*OFF illuminates

50

Seats, restraints

9 Danger

Deactivate passenger airbag only
in combination with the use of a
child restraint system, subject to
the instructions and restrictions in
the tables 3 52.
Otherwise, there is a risk of fatal
injury for a person occupying a
seat with a deactivated front
passenger airbag.

If the control indicator V illuminates
for approx. 60 seconds after the
ignition is switched on, the front
passenger airbag system will inflate
in the event of a collision.
If both control indicators are
illuminated at the same time, there is
a system failure. The status of the
system is not discernible, therefore
no person is allowed to occupy the
front passenger seat. Contact a
workshop immediately.
Change status only when the vehicle
is stopped with the ignition off.
Status remains until the next change.
Control indicator for airbag
deactivation 3 92.

Child restraints
Child restraint systems
We recommend Opel child restraint
systems which are tailored
specifically to the vehicle.
The following child restraints are
recommended for the following
weight classes:
■ Group 0, Group 0+

Maxi Cosi Cabriofix plus Easyfix,
for children up to 13 kg

■ Group I

OPEL Duo, for children from 13 kg
to 18 kg in this group

When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.
Check local laws and regulations for
mandatory use of child restraint
systems. In some countries, the use
of child restraint systems is forbidden
on certain seats.

Seats, restraints

51

A child restraint system which has
been subjected to stress in an
accident must be replaced.

9 Danger

If using a rear-facing child restraint
system on the front passenger
seat, the airbag system for the
front passenger seat must be
deactivated. This also applies to
certain forward-facing child
restraint systems as indicated in
the tables 3 52.

Airbag deactivation 3 49.
Airbag label 3 44.
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This ensures that the child's
backbone, which is still very weak, is
under less strain in the event of an
accident.
Selecting the right system
Only use suitable restraint systems,
e.g. those that comply with valid
UN ECE regulations.

Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type. Refer to the tables on
the following pages, the instructions
supplied with the child restraint
system and the vehicle type list of
non-universal child restraint systems.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct, see following
tables.
Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.
When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.
Child restraint systems could be
fastened with ISOFIX mounting
brackets, Top-tether if available,
and/or a three-point seat belt. Refer
to the following tables.
Note
Do not affix anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.

for petrol engines.
Diesel engines
The start of the engine without
additional heaters is possible down to
-25 °С.
Petrol engines
The start of the engine without
additional heaters is possible down to
-30 °C.

Required is an engine oil with the
correct viscosity, the correct fuel,
performed services and a sufficiently
charged vehicle battery.
With temperatures below -30 °C, the
automatic transmission requires a
warming phase of approx. 5 minutes.
The selector lever must be in position
P.
Automatic starter control
This function controls the engine
starting procedure. The driver does
not need to hold the key in position 3.
Once applied, the system will go on
starting automatically until the engine
is running. Because of the checking
procedure, the engine starts running
after a short delay.
Possible reasons for a non-starting
engine:
■ clutch pedal not operated (manual

transmission)

■ brake pedal not operated or
selector lever not in P or N
(automatic transmission)

■ timeout occurred

On vehicles with manual transmission
automated, the engine is started
automatically as soon as the brake
pedal is released.
A vehicle battery sensor ensures that
an Autostop is only performed if the
vehicle battery is sufficiently charged
for a restart.
Activation
The stop-start system is available as
soon as the engine is started, the
vehicle starts-off and the conditions
as stated below in this section are
fulfilled.
Deactivation

Turbo engine warm-up
Upon start-up, engine available
torque may be limited for a short time,
especially when the engine
temperature is cold. The limitation is
to allow the lubrication system to fully
protect the engine.

Overrun cut-off
The fuel supply is automatically cut-
off during overrun, i.e. when the
vehicle is driven with a gear engaged
but accelerator is released.

Stop-start system
The stop-start system helps to save
fuel and to reduce the exhaust
emissions. When conditions allow, it
switches off the engine as soon as the
vehicle is at a low speed or at a
standstill, e.g. at a traffic light or in a
traffic jam.
On vehicles with manual
transmission, the engine is started
automatically as soon as the clutch is
depressed.

the turbocharger.

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving without
any notification. The filter is cleaned
by periodically burning off the soot
particles at high temperature. This
process takes place automatically
under set driving conditions and may

take up to 25 minutes. Typically it
needs between seven and
12 minutes. Autostop is not available
and fuel consumption may be higher
during this period. The emission of
smells and smoke during this process
is normal.

Under certain driving conditions, e.g.
short distances, the system cannot
clean itself automatically.
If cleaning of the filter is required and
if previous driving conditions did not
enable automatic cleaning, it will be
indicated by control indicator %.
Simultaneously a warning message
or warning code appears in the Driver
Information Centre.
% illuminates when diesel particle
filter is full. Start cleaning process as
soon as possible.

% flashes when diesel particle filter
has reached the maximum filling
level. Start cleaning process
immediately to avoid damage to the
engine.
Cleaning process
To activate cleaning process,
continue driving, keep engine speed
above 2000 revolutions per minute.
Shift down if necessary. Diesel
particle filter cleaning is then started.
If g illuminates additionally,
cleaning is not possible, seek the
assistance of a workshop.

Caution

If the cleaning process is
interrupted, there is a risk of
provoking severe engine damage.

Cleaning takes place quickest at high
engine speeds and loads.
The control indicator % extinguishes
as soon as the self-cleaning
operation is complete.

Unburnt petrol will overheat and
damage the catalytic converter.
Therefore avoid excessive use of
the starter, running the fuel tank
dry and starting the engine by
pushing or towing.

In the event of misfiring, uneven
engine running, a reduction in engine
performance or other unusual
problems, have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop as soon as
possible. In an emergency, driving
can be continued for a short period,
keeping vehicle speed and engine
speed low.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing your journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.

ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting off the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.

Basic notes on parking assist
systems

9 Warning

Under certain circumstances,
various reflective surfaces on
objects or clothing as well as
external noise sources may cause
the system to fail to detect
obstacles.
Special attention must be paid to
low obstacles which can damage
the lower part of the bumper.

Caution

Performance of the system can be
reduced when sensors are
covered, e.g. by ice or snow.
Performance of the parking assist
system can be reduced due to
heavy loading.
Special conditions apply if there
are taller vehicles in the vicinity
(e.g. off-road vehicles, mini vans,
vans). Object identification and

166

Driving and operating

correct distance indication in the
upper part of these vehicles
cannot be guaranteed.
Objects with a very small reflection
cross-section, e.g. objects of
narrow size or soft materials, may
not be detected by the system.
Parking assist systems do not
detect objects outside the
detection range.

Note
It is possible that the sensor detects
a non-existing object caused by
echo disturbance from external
acoustic noise or mechanical
misalignments (sporadic false
warnings may occur).
Make sure that the front number
plate is properly mounted (not bent
and no gaps to the bumper on the left
or right side) and the sensors are
firmly in place.
Advanced parking assist system
may not respond to changes in the
available parking space after
initiating a parking manoeuvre. The
system may recognize an entry, a

gateway, a courtyard or even a
crossing as a parking slot. After
selecting reverse gear the system
will start a parking manoeuvre. Take
care regarding the availability of the
suggested parking slot.
Surface irregularities, e.g. on
construction zones, are not detected
by the system. The driver accepts
responsibility.
Note
If engaging a forward gear and
exceeding a certain speed, the rear
parking assist will be deactivated
when the rear carrier system is
extended.
If engaging reverse at first, the
parking assist will detect the rear
carrier system and provide a buzzing
sound. Press r or D briefly to
deactivate the parking assist.
Note
After production, the system
requires a calibration. For optimal
parking guidance, a driving distance
of at least 10 km, including a number
of bends, is required.

The driver assistance systems do
not relieve the driver from full
responsibility for vehicle
operation.
Lane departure warning
The lane departure warning system
observes the lane markings between
which the vehicle is driving via a front
camera. The system detects lane
changes and warns the driver in the
event of an unintended lane change
via visual and acoustic signals.

Criteria for the detection of an
unintended lane change are:
■ No operation of turn signals.
■ No brake pedal operation.
■ No active accelerator operation or

speeding-up.

■ No active steering.
If the driver is performing these
actions, no warning will be issued.

Fault
The lane departure warning system
may not operate properly when:
■ The windscreen is not clean.
■ There are adverse environmental
conditions like heavy rain, snow,
direct sunlight or shadows.

The system can not operate when no
lane marking is detected.

Fuel
Fuel for petrol engines
Only use unleaded fuel that complies
with European standard EN 228 or
E DIN 51626-1 or equivalent.
Your engine is capable of running
with E10 fuel that fulfills these
standards. E10 fuel contains up to
10 % bioethanol.
Use fuel with the recommended
octane rating 3 241. Use of fuel with
too low an octane rating can reduce
engine power and torque and slightly
increases fuel consumption.

Caution

Do not use fuel or fuel additives
that contain metallic compounds
such as manganese-based
additives. This may cause engine
damage.

Driving and operating

173

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 228 or E DIN 51626-1 or
equivalent can lead to deposits or
engine damage and may affect
your warranty.

Caution

Use of fuel with too low an octane
rating could lead to uncontrolled
combustion and engine damage.
Fuel for diesel engines
Only use diesel fuel that complies
with EN 590.
In countries outside the European
Union use Euro-Diesel fuel with a
sulphur concentration below 50 ppm.

The boiling point depends on the
pressure and mixing ratio. At ambient
pressure, it is between -42 °C (pure
propane) and -0.5 °C (pure butane).

Caution

The system works at an ambient
temperature of approx. -8 °C to
100 °C.

Full function of the LPG system can
only be guaranteed with liquid gas
which complies with the minimum
requirements of DIN EN 589.

174

Driving and operating

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 590 or similar can lead to
engine powerloss, increased wear
or engine damage and may affect
your warranty.

Do not use marine diesel oils, heating
oils, Aquazole and similar diesel-
water emulsions. Diesel fuels must
not be diluted with fuels for petrol
engines.

Fuel for liquid gas
operation
Liquid gas is known as LPG
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas) or under
its French name GPL (Gaz de Pétrole
Liquéfié). LPG is also known as
Autogas.
LPG consists mainly of propane and
butane. The octane rating is between
105 and 115, depending on the
butane proportion. LPG is stored
liquid at around 5 - 10 bar pressure.

Pressing the LPG button switches
between petrol and liquid gas
operation as soon as the required
parameters (coolant temperature,
gas temperature and minimum
engine speed) have been reached.
The requirements are usually fulfilled
after approx. 60 seconds (depending
on exterior temperature) and the first
firm press on the accelerator. The
LED status shows the current
operating mode.

for fuel transition, or fuel
transition is denied
(message in the DIC
appears)

As soon as the liquid gas tanks are
empty, petrol operation is
automatically engaged until the
ignition is switched off.

Every six months, run the petrol tank
down until control indicator Y
illuminates, then refuel. This helps
maintain fuel quality and system
function for petrol operation.
Fill the tank completely at regular
intervals to prevent corrosion in the
tank.
Faults and remedies
If gas mode is not possible, check the
following:
■ Is there enough liquid gas present?
■ Is there enough petrol present for

starting?

Due to extreme temperatures in
combination with the gas
composition, it may take slightly
longer before the system switches
from petrol to gas mode.
In extreme situations, the system may
also switch back to petrol mode if the
minimum requirements are not
fulfilled.
Seek the assistance of a workshop in
the event of all other faults.

The figures are provided only for the
purpose of comparison between
different vehicle variants and must
not be taken as a guarantee for the
actual fuel consumption of a
particular vehicle. Additional
equipment may result in slightly
higher results than the stated
consumption and CO2 figures.
Furthermore, fuel consumption is
dependent on personal driving style
as well as road and traffic conditions.

Fuel consumption - CO2-
Emissions
The fuel consumption (combined) of
the model Opel Corsa is within a
range of 7.5 to 3.1 l/100 km.
The CO2 emission (combined) is
within a range of 174 to 82 g/km.
For the values specific for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
General information
The official fuel consumption and
specific CO2 emission figures quoted
relate to the EU base model with
standard equipment.
Fuel consumption data and CO2
emission data are determined
according to regulation R (EC)
No. 715/2007 (in the latest applicable
version), taking into consideration the
vehicle weight in running order, as
specified by the regulation.

Trailer hitch
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.
Fitting of towing equipment could
cover the opening of the towing eye.
If this is the case use the coupling ball
bar for towing. Always keep the
coupling ball bar in the vehicle.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements.
For trailers with low driving stability
and caravan trailers with a permitted
gross vehicle weight of more than

180

Driving and operating

1000 kg a speed of 80 km/h must not
be exceeded; the use of a stabiliser is
recommended.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 250.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12 %

The permitted trailer loads apply up to
the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10 %
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8 %, e.g. motorways).
The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 237.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.
Petrol and diesel engines
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (55 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.

Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.
Engine B14XEL LPG
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (45 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.
Rear axle load
Petrol and diesel engines
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) for passenger vehicles
may be exceeded by 70 kg for the 5-
door vehicle and 60 kg for the 3-door
vehicle, the gross vehicle weight
rating by 55 kg.

Engine B14XEL LPG
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) for passenger vehicles
may be exceeded by 70 kg for the 5-
door vehicle and 70 kg for the 3-door
vehicle, the gross vehicle weight
rating by 45 kg.
Delivery van
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) for passenger vehicles
may be exceeded by 60 kg, the gross
vehicle weight rating by 55 kg.
General
If the permitted rear axle load is
exceeded a maximum speed of
100 km/h applies. If lower national
maximum speeds are specified for
trailer operation, they must be
complied with.

Vehicle care

Wheels and tyres

Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.
We recommend not swapping the
front wheels with the rear wheels and
vice versa, as this can affect vehicle
stability. Always use less worn tyres
on the rear axle.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
All tyre sizes are permitted as winter
tyres 3 250.

In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the speed sticker in
the driver's field of view.

Tyre designations
E.g. 195/55 R 16 95 H
195 = tyre width, mm
55 = cross-section ratio (tyre height

to tyre width), %
R = belt type: Radial
RF = type: RunFlat
16 = wheel diameter, inches
95 = load index e.g. 95 is equivalent

to 690 kg

H = speed code letter
Speed code letter:
Q = up to 160 km/h
S = up to 180 km/h
T = up to 190 km/h
H = up to 210 km/h
V = up to 240 km/h
W = up to 270 km/h

Directional tyres
Directional tyres must be mounted so
that they rotate in the correct
direction. The proper rotation
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel.
This also applies to vehicles with tyre
pressure monitoring system.
Unscrew the valve cap.

Tyre pressure 3 250.
The tyre pressure information label
on the right door frame indicates the
original equipment tyres and the
correspondent tyre pressures.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.
Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options.
For the correct tyre pressure value,
follow the procedure below:
■ Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 241.

■ Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 250.

Vehicle care

209

For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The tyre pressure monitoring system
(TPMS) checks the pressure of all
four tyres once a minute when vehicle
speed exceeds a certain limit.

9 Warning

Caution

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition. After
adjusting tyre pressure switch on
ignition and select the relevant setting
on the page Tyre load in the Driver
Information Centre 3 97.

Tyre pressure monitoring system
warns only about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.
Note
In countries where the tyre pressure
monitoring system is legally
required, the use of wheels without
pressure sensors will invalidate the
vehicle type approval.

210

Vehicle care

The current tyre pressures can be
shown in the Vehicle Information
Menu ? in the Driver Information
Centre (DIC).
The menu can be selected by
pressing the buttons on the turn

A detected low tyre pressure
condition is indicated by the control
indicator w 3 95.
If w illuminates, stop as soon as
possible and inflate the tyres as
recommended 3 250.
If w flashes for 60-90 seconds and
then illuminates continuously, there is
a fault in the system. Consult a
workshop.

After inflating, some driving may be
required to update the tyre pressure
values in the DIC. During this time w
may illuminate.
If w illuminates at lower temperatures
and extinguishes after driving, this
could be an indicator for approaching
a low tyre pressure condition. Check
tyre pressure.
Vehicle messages 3 105.
If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition.
Only mount wheels with pressure
sensors, otherwise the tyre pressure
will not be displayed and w
illuminates continuously.
A spare wheel or temporary spare
wheel is not equipped with pressure
sensors. The tyre pressure
monitoring system is not operational
for these tyres. Control indicator w
illuminates. For the further three
tyres, the system remains
operational.

The use of commercially-available
liquid tyre repair kits can impair the
function of the system. Factory-
approved repair kits can be used.
External high-power radio equipment
could disrupt the tyre pressure
monitoring system.
Each time the tyres are replaced, tyre
pressure monitoring system sensors
must be dismounted and serviced.
For the screwed sensor; replace
valve core and sealing ring. For the
clipped sensor; replace complete
valve stem.

TPMS sensor matching process
Each TPMS sensor has a unique
identification code. The identification
code must be matched to a new
wheel position after rotating the
wheels or exchanging the complete
wheel set and if one or more TPMS
sensors were replaced. The TPMS
sensor matching process should also

be performed after replacing a spare
wheel with a road wheel containing
the TPMS sensor.
The malfunction light w and the
warning message or code should go
off at the next ignition cycle. The
sensors are matched to the wheel
positions, using a TPMS relearn tool,
in the following order: left side front
wheel, right side front wheel, right
side rear wheel and left side rear
wheel. The turn signal light at the
current active position is illuminated
until sensor is matched.
Consult your workshop for service or
to purchase a relearn tool. There are
2 minutes to match the first wheel
position, and 5 minutes overall to
match all four wheel positions. If it
takes longer, the matching process
stops and must be restarted.
The TPMS sensor matching process
is:
1. Apply the parking brake.
2. Turn the ignition on.

3. On vehicles with automatic

transmission: set the selector
lever to P.
On vehicles with manual
transmission automated: Press
and hold brake pedal. Move and
hold the selector lever for
5 seconds in position N until P is
displayed in the DIC. P indicates
that the sensor matching process
of the TPMS can be started.
On vehicles with manual
transmission: select neutral.

14. Set all four tyres to the

recommended air pressure level
as indicated on the tyre pressure
information label.

15. Ensure the tyre loading status is

set according to the selected
pressure 3 97.

Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase. Tyre pressure
values provided on the tyre
information label and tyre pressure
chart are valid for cold tyres, which
means at 20 °C. The pressure
increases by nearly 10 kPa for a 10
°C temperature increase. This must
be considered when warm tyres are
checked.

214

Vehicle care

The tyre pressure value displayed in
the DIC shows the real tyre pressure.
A cooled down tyre will show a
decreased value, which does not
indicate an air leak.

Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.
Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons it is recommended
that the tread depth of the tyres on
one axle should not vary by more than
2 mm.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and to make other
vehicle modifications.
After converting to a different tyre
size, have the label with tyre
pressures replaced.

Caution

When converting to wheels with
14 inch diameter, the ground
clearance will be reduced. This
must be considered when passing
over obstacles.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheels
may lead to accidents and will
invalidate the vehicle type
approval.

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear
indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every six years.

Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.

Steel wheels: When using locking
wheel nuts, do not attach wheel
covers.

Tyre chains

Tyre chains are only permitted on the
front wheels.
Always use fine mesh chains that add
no more than 10 mm to the tyre tread
and the inboard sides (including chain
lock).

9 Warning

Damage may lead to tyre blowout.

Tyre chains are permitted on tyres of
size 175/70 R14, 185/70 R14,
185/65 R15, 205/45 R17.

Vehicle care

Jump starting
Do not start with a quick charger.
A vehicle with a discharged vehicle
battery can be started using jump
leads and the vehicle battery of
another vehicle.

9 Warning

Be extremely careful when starting
with jump leads. Any deviation
from the following instructions can
lead to injuries or damage caused
by battery explosion or damage to
the electrical systems of both
vehicles.

9 Warning

Avoid contact of the battery with
eyes, skin, fabrics and painted
surfaces. The fluid contains
sulphuric acid which can cause
injuries and damage in the event
of direct contact.

■ Never expose the battery to naked

flames or sparks.

■ A discharged vehicle battery can
already freeze at a temperature of
0 °C. Defrost the frozen battery
before connecting jump leads.

■ Wear eye protection and protective

clothing when handling a battery.

■ Use a booster battery with the

same voltage (12 Volts). Its
capacity (Ah) must not be much
less than that of the discharged
vehicle battery.

■ Use jump leads with insulated

terminals and a cross section of at
least 16 mm2 (25 mm2 for diesel
engines).

■ Do not disconnect the discharged

vehicle battery from the vehicle.

■ Switch off all unnecessary electrical

consumers.

■ Do not lean over the battery during

jump starting.

■ Do not allow the terminals of one

lead to touch those of the other
lead.

2. After 5 minutes, start the other

engine. Start attempts should be
made for no longer than
15 seconds at an interval of
one minute.

3. Allow both engines to idle for

approx. 3 minutes with the leads
connected.

4. Switch on electrical consumers

(e.g. headlights, heated rear
window) of the vehicle receiving
the jump start.

5. Reverse above sequence exactly

when removing leads.

Lead connection order:
1. Connect the red lead to the

positive terminal of the booster
vehicle battery.

2. Connect the other end of the red
lead to the positive terminal of the
discharged vehicle battery.

3. Connect the black lead to the

negative terminal of the booster
vehicle battery.

4. Connect the other end of the black
lead to a vehicle grounding point,
such as the engine block or an
engine mounting bolt. Connect as
far away from the discharged
vehicle battery as possible,
however at least 60 cm.

Route the leads so that they cannot
catch on rotating parts in the engine
compartment.
To start the engine:
1. Start the engine of the vehicle

providing the jump.

Attach a tow rope – or better still a tow
rod – to the towing eye.
The towing eye must only be used for
towing and not for recovering the
vehicle.
Switch on ignition to release steering
wheel lock and to permit operation of
brake lights, horn and windscreen
wiper.
Transmission in neutral.

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

When the engine is not running,
considerably more force is needed to
brake and steer.
To prevent the entry of exhaust gases
from the towing vehicle, switch on the
air recirculation and close the
windows.
Vehicles with automatic transmission:
the vehicle must be towed facing
forwards, not faster than 80 km/h nor
further than 100 km. In all other cases
and when the transmission is
defective, the front axle must be
raised off the ground.
Vehicles with manual transmission
automated: the vehicle must only be
towed facing forwards with the front
axle raised off the ground.
Seek the assistance of a workshop.
After towing, unscrew the towing eye.

Insert cap at the top and engage
downwards.

Towing another vehicle

Insert a screwdriver in the slot at the
lower bend of the cap. Release the
cap by carefully moving the
screwdriver downwards.
The towing eye is stowed with the
vehicle tools 3 207.

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.

Vehicle care

229

Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use a de-icing agent only
when absolutely necessary, as this
has a degreasing effect and impairs
lock function. After using a de-icing
agent, have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select a programme that
includes waxing. Restrictions for
filmed or matt painted body parts or
decor tapes, see "Polishing and
waxing".

Screw in the towing eye as far as it will
go until it stops in a horizontal
position.
The lashing eye at the rear
underneath the vehicle must never be
used as a towing eye.
Attach a tow rope – or even better a
tow bar – to the towing eye.
The towing eye must only be used for
towing and not for recovering a
vehicle.

230

Vehicle care

Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.
If using a car wash, comply with the
car wash manufacturer's instructions.
The windscreen wiper and rear
window wiper must be switched off.
Remove antenna and external
accessories such as roof racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of 4 to 9.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.

Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax painted parts of the vehicle
regularly (at the latest when water no
longer beads). Otherwise, the
paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.

Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Unpainted plastic body parts must not
be treated with wax or polishing
agents.
Matt filmed body parts or decor tapes
must not be polished, to avoid
gleaming. Do not use hot wax
programmes in automatic car washes
if the vehicle is equipped with these
parts.
Matt painted decor parts, e.g. mirror
housing cover, must not be polished.
Otherwise these parts would become
agleam or the colour would be
dissolved.
Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.

For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with a
soft cloth and window cleaner.
Remove dirt residues from smearing
wiper blades by using a soft cloth and
window cleaner. Also make sure to
remove any residues such as wax,
insect residues and similar from the
window.
Ice residues, pollution and continuous
wiping on dry windows will damage or
even destroy the wiper blades.
Sunroof
Never clean with solvents or abrasive
agents, fuels, aggressive media
(e.g. paint cleaner, acetone-
containing solutions etc.), acidic or
highly alkaline media or abrasive
pads. Do not apply wax or polishing
agents to the sunroof.

Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.

Vehicle care

231

Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Liquid gas system

9 Danger

Liquid gas is heavier than air and
can collect in sink points.
Take care when performing work
at the underbody in a pit.

For painting work and when using a
drying booth at a temperature above
60 °C, the liquid gas tank must be
removed.
Do not make any modifications to the
liquid gas system.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Rear carrier system
Clean the rear carrier system with a
steam-jet or high-pressure jet cleaner
at least once a year.

232

Vehicle care

Operate the rear carrier system
periodically if not in regular use, in
particular during winter.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument cluster and the
displays should only be cleaned using
a soft damp cloth. If necessary use a
weak soap solution.
Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-
coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.

Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, like zips or
belts or studded jeans.

Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

Only use products that meet the
recommended specifications.
Damage resulting from the use of
products not in line with these
specifications will not be covered by
the warranty.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil

aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
petrol and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities have to be used.
Recommendations for petrol engines
are also valid for Compressed Natural
Gas (CNG), Liquified Petroleum Gas
(LPG) and Ethanol (E85) fuelled
engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 238.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.

Service and maintenance

235

Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 238.
Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 238.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.

Coolant and antifreeze
Use only silicate-free long life coolant
(LLC) antifreeze. Consult a
workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C. In
northern countries with very low
temperatures the factory filled coolant
provides frost protection down to
approx. -37 °C. This concentration
should be maintained all year round.
The use of additional coolant
additives that intend to give additional
corrosion protection or seal against
minor leaks can cause function
problems. Liability for consequences
resulting from the use of additional
coolant additives will be rejected.
Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.

When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
■ Operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels).

■ Status messages of the vehicle and
its single components (e.g. number
of wheel revolutions / rotational
speed, deceleration, lateral
acceleration).

■ Dysfunctions and defects in

important system components.

■ Vehicle reactions in particular

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the stability
regulation system).

■ Environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature).

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimizing vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

Customer information

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
