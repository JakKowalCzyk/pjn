OverviewEco-driving

Eco-driving is a range of everyday practices that allow the motorist to optimise their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

Optimise the use of your gearbox

With a manual gearbox, move off gently and change up without waiting. 
During acceleration change up early.

With an automatic gearbox, give preference to automatic mode and 
avoid pressing the accelerator pedal heavily or suddenly.

The gear efficiency indicator invites you to engage the most suitable 
gear: as soon as the indication is displayed in the instrument panel, 
follow it straight away.
For vehicles fitted with an automatic gearbox, this indicator appears 
only in manual mode.

Drive smoothly
Maintain a safe distance between vehicles, use engine braking rather 
than the brake pedal, and press the accelerator progressively. These 
practices contribute towards a reduction in fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions and also help reduce the background traffic noise.

If your vehicle has cruise control, make use of the system at speeds 
above 25 mph (40 km/h) when the traffic is flowing well.

Control the use of your electrical 
equipment
Before moving off, if the passenger compartment is too warm, ventilate it 
by opening the windows and air vents before using the air conditioning.
Above 30 mph (50 km/h), close the windows and leave the air vents 
open.
Remember to make use of equipment that can help keep the 
temperature in the passenger compartment down (sunroof and window 
blinds...).
Switch off the air conditioning, unless it has automatic regulation, as 
soon as the desired temperature is attained.
Switch off the demisting and defrosting controls, if not automatic.
Switch off the heated seat as soon as possible.
Switch off the headlamps and front foglamps when the ambient light 
level does not require their use.

Avoid running the engine before moving off, particularly in winter; your 
vehicle will warm up much faster while driving.

As a passenger, if you avoid connecting your multimedia devices 
(film, music, video game...), you will contribute towards limiting the 
consumption of electrical energy, and so of fuel.
Disconnect your portable devices before leaving the vehicle.

9

.Eco-drivingLimit the causes of excess consumption

Spread loads throughout the vehicle; place the heaviest items in the 
bottom of the boot, as close as possible to the rear seats.
Limit the loads carried in the vehicle and reduce wind resistance (roof 
bars, roof rack, bicycle carrier, trailer...). Use a roof box in preference.
Remove roof bars and roof racks after use.

At the end of winter, remove snow tyres and refit your summer tyres.

Observe the recommendations on 
maintenance
Check the tyre pressures regularly, when cold, referring to the label in 
the door aperture, driver's side.
Carry out this check in particular:
- 
- 
- 
Don't forget the spare wheel and the tyres on any trailer or caravan.

before a long journey,
at each change of season,
after a long period out of use.

Have your vehicle serviced regularly (engine oil, oil filter, air filter, 
passenger compartment filter...) and observe the schedule of 
operations recommended in the manufacturer's service schedule.
With a BlueHDi Diesel engine, if the SCR system is faulty your vehicle 
becomes polluting; go to a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop 
without delay to have the emissions of nitrogen oxides brought back to 
the legal level.

When refuelling, do not continue after the third cut-off of the nozzle to 
avoid any overflow.

At the wheel of your new vehicle, it is only after the first 1 800 miles 
(3 000 kilometres) that you will see the fuel consumption settle down to 
a consistent average.

InstrumentsIndicator and warning lamps

Visual indicators informing the driver that a system is in operation, switched off or has a fault.

Associated warnings
The switching on of certain warning lamps may 
be accompanied by an audible signal and a 
message.
The warning lamps may come on continuously 
(fixed) or flash.

When the ignition is switched on
Certain warning lamps come on for a few 
seconds in the instrument panel when the 
vehicle's ignition is switched on.
When the engine is started, these same 
warning lamps should go off.
If they remain on, before moving off, refer to the 
information on the warning lamp concerned.

When switching on the ignition, the 
displays in the instrument panel appear 
dynamically and progressively. This is 
normal operation.

Certain warning lamps may come on in 
one of two modes: fixed (continuous) or 
flashing.
Only by relating the type of illumination 
to the operation of the vehicle can it 
be determined whether the situation is 
normal or a fault has occurred. In the 
event of a fault, the illumination of the 
warning lamp may be accompanied by 
a message.
Refer to the tables in the following 
pages for more information.

Range
(miles or km)

The distance which can still be travelled with 
the fuel remaining in the tank (at the average 
fuel consumption seen over the last few miles 
(kilometres) travelled).

This value may vary following a change 
in the style of driving or the relief, 
resulting in a significant change in the 
current fuel consumption.

When the range falls below 20 miles (30 km), 
dashes are displayed.
After filling with at least 5 litres of fuel, the 
range is recalculated and is displayed if it 
exceeds 60 miles (100 km).

If dashes are displayed continuously 
while driving in place of the digits, 
contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

Current fuel  
consumption
(mpg or l/100 km or km/l)

Calculated over the last few seconds.

Distance travelled
(miles or km)

Calculated since the last trip computer reset.

This function is only displayed from 
20 mph (30 km/h).

Stop & Start time counter
(minutes / seconds or hours / 
minutes)

Average fuel consumption
(mpg or l/100 km or km/l)

Calculated since the last trip computer reset.

A time counter calculates the time spent in 
STOP mode during a journey.
It resets to zero every time the ignition is 
switched on.

Average speed
(mph or km/h)

Calculated since the last trip computer reset.

82

Ease of use and comfortVentilation
Air intake
The air circulating in the passenger compartment 
is filtered and originates either from the outside via 
the grille located at the base of the windscreen or 
from the inside in air recirculation mode.
Air treatment
The incoming air follows various routes 
depending on the controls selected by the 
driver:
- 

direct arrival in the passenger 
compartment (air intake),
passage through a heating circuit (heating),
passage through a cooling circuit (air 
conditioning).

- 
- 

Control panel

Depending on equipment, the 
controls of this system are accessible 
in the Air conditioning menu of 
the touch screen or on the centre 
console panel located below the 
audio system.

The demisting/defrosting controls for the 
windscreen and rear screen are located below 
the touch screen or on the centre console 
panel located below the audio system.

3Ease of use and comfortRecommendations for ventilation and air conditioning

In order for these systems to be fully effective, follow the operation and maintenance 
guidelines below:
F  To obtain an even air distribution, take care not to obstruct the exterior air intake grilles 
located at the base of the windscreen, the nozzles, the vents and the air outlets, as well 
as the air extractor located in the boot.

F  Do not cover the sunshine sensor, located on the dashboard; this is used for regulation 

of the air conditioning system.

F  Operate the air conditioning system for at least 5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a month 

to keep it in perfect working order.

F  Ensure that the passenger compartment filter is in good condition and have the filter 

elements replaced regularly.

  We recommend the use of a combined passenger compartment filter. Thanks to its 

special active additive, it contributes to the purification of the air breathed by the 
occupants and the cleanliness of the passenger compartment (reduction of allergic 
symptoms, bad odours and greasy deposits).

F  To ensure correct operation of the air conditioning system, you are also advised to have 

F 

it checked regularly as recommended in the maintenance and warranty guide.
If the system does not produce cold air, switch it off and contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

When towing the maximum load on a steep gradient in high temperatures, switching off the 
air conditioning increases the available engine power and so improves the towing ability.

If after an extended stop in sunshine, 
the interior temperature is very high, first 
ventilate the passenger compartment for 
a few moments.
Put the air flow control at a setting high 
enough to quickly change the air in the 
passenger compartment.

The condensation created by the air 
conditioning results in a discharge 
of water under the vehicle which is 
perfectly normal.

Stop & Start
The heating and air conditioning 
systems only work when the engine is 
running.
To maintain a comfortable temperature 
in the passenger compartment, you can 
temporarily deactivate the Stop & Start 
system.
For more information on Stop & Start, 
refer to the corresponding section.

SafetyElectronic stability control (ESC)

anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic brake force distribution (EBFD),
emergency braking assistance (EBA),

Electronic stability control (ESC) incorporating the following systems:
- 
- 
-  wheel anti-slip regulation (ASR) or traction control,
- 

dynamic stability control (DSC).

Definitions
Anti-lock braking system (ABS) 
and electronic brake force 
distribution (EBFD)
This system improves the stability and 
manoeuvrability of your vehicle when braking 
and contributes towards improved control on 
corners, in particular on poor or slippery road 
surfaces.
The ABS prevents wheel lock in the event of 
emergency braking.
The EBFD manages the braking pressure 
wheel by wheel.

Emergency braking assistance 
(EBA)
In an emergency, this system enables you to 
reach the optimum braking pressure more 
quickly and therefore reduce the stopping 
distance.
It is triggered according to the speed at which 
the brake pedal is pressed. This is felt by a 
reduction in the resistance of the pedal and an 
increase in the effectiveness of the braking.

Anti-slip regulation (ASR)
The ASR system (also known as Traction 
Control) optimises traction in order to limit 
wheel slip by acting on the brakes of the driving 
wheels and on the engine. It also improves 
the directional stability of the vehicle on 
acceleration.

Dynamic stability control (DSC)
If there is a difference between the path 
followed by the vehicle and that required by 
the driver, the DSC monitors each wheel and 
automatically acts on the brake of one or more 
wheels and on the engine to return the vehicle 
to the required path, within the limits of the laws 
of physics.

123

5SafetyAnti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic brake force 
distribution (EBFD)

The fixed illumination of this warning 
lamp indicates that there is a fault 
with the ABS.
The vehicle retains conventional 
braking. Drive carefully at moderate 
speed.

When this warning lamp comes on, 
coupled with the STOP and ABS warning 
lamps, accompanied by an audible signal 
and a message, it indicates that there 
is a fault with the electronic brake force 
distribution (EBFD).

You must stop as soon as it is safe to do so.
In both cases, have the system checked by a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop as 
soon as possible.

When changing wheels (tyres and 
rims), ensure that these are approved 
for your vehicle.
Normal operation of the ABS may make 
itself felt by slight vibrations of the brake 
pedal.

In emergency braking, press very 
firmly and maintain this pressure.

124

SafetyAnti-slip regulation (ASR)
Activation
This system is activated automatically each 
time the vehicle is started.
It comes into operation in the event of a 
problem of grip.

This is indicated by the flashing of 
this warning lamp in the instrument 
panel.

Deactivation
In exceptional conditions (starting a vehicle 
which is bogged down, stuck in snow, on soft 
ground, etc.), it may be advisable to deactivate 
the ASR system, so that the wheels can turn 
freely and regain grip.

Reactivation
The system is reactivated automatically every 
time the ignition is switched back on or from 
30 mph (50 km/h).
Below 30 mph (50 km/h), you can reactivate it 
manually.

Reactivation is via the Driving menu 
of the touch screen.
It is confirmed by a message.

Operating fault

Illumination of this warning lamp, 
accompanied by an audible signal 
and a message, indicate a fault with 
the system.

Reactivate the systems as soon as the level of 
grip permits.

Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked.

Deactivation is via the Driving menu 
of the touch screen.
It is confirmed by a message.

After an impact, have the system 
checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

ASR / DSC
These systems offer even greater 
safety during normal driving but should 
not encourage the driver to take 
additional risks or drive at excessively 
high speed.
It is when the traction conditions 
deteriorate (rain, snow, ice) that the risk 
of loss of grip increases. Therefore, for 
your safety, it is essential to leave these 
systems active in all conditions, and 
particularly in difficult conditions.
The operation of these systems 
is assured on condition that the 
manufacturer's recommendations 
concerning the wheels (tyres and rims), 
the braking components, the electronic 
components and the CITROËN network 
fitting and repair procedures are 
complied with.
To ensure the effectiveness of these 
systems in winter conditions, it is 
essential to fit the vehicle with four 
snow tyres which will enable the vehicle 
to maintain neutral handling.

5SafetySeat belts
Front seat belts

Rear seat belts

The front seat belts are fitted with a 
pretensioning and force limiting system.
This system improves safety in the front 
seats in the event of a front or side impact. 
Depending on the severity of the impact, the 
pretensioning system instantly tightens the seat 
belts against the body of the occupants.
The pretensioning seat belts are active when 
the ignition is on.
The force limiter reduces the pressure of the 
seat belt on the chest of the occupant, so 
improving their protection.

The rear seats are each fitted with a three-point 
inertia reel seat belt.
The side seats have a pretensioning system 
and a force limiter.

5SafetyAdvice
The driver must ensure that passengers use 
the seat belts correctly and that they are all 
fastened before setting off.
Wherever you are seated in the vehicle, 
always fasten your seat belt, even for short 
journeys.
Do not interchange the seat belt buckles as 
they will not fulfill their role fully.
The seat belts are fitted with an inertia reel 
permitting automatic adjustment of the 
length of the strap to your size. The seat belt 
is stowed automatically when not in use.
Before and after use, ensure that the seat 
belt is reeled in correctly.
The lower part of the strap must be 
positioned as low as possible on the pelvis.
The upper part must be positioned in the 
hollow of the shoulder.
The inertia reels are fitted with an automatic 
locking device which comes into operation in 
the event of a collision, emergency braking 
or if the vehicle rolls over. You can release 
the device by pulling the strap firmly and 
then releasing it so that it reels in slightly.

128

- 

In order to be effective, a seat belt must:
be tightened as close to the body as 
- 
possible,
be pulled in front of you with a smooth 
movement, checking that it does not 
twist,
be used to restrain only one person,
not bear any trace of cuts or fraying,
not be converted or modified to avoid 
affecting its performance.

- 
- 
- 

In accordance with current safety 
regulations, for all repairs on your vehicle's 
seat belts, go to a qualified workshop with 
the skills and equipment needed, which a 
CITROËN dealer is able to provide.
Have your seat belts checked regularly by 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop, 
particularly if the straps show signs of 
damage.
Clean the seat belt straps with soapy 
water or a textile cleaning product, sold by 
CITROËN dealers.
After folding or moving a seat or rear bench 
seat, ensure that the seat belt is positioned 
and reeled in correctly.

Recommendations for children
Use a suitable child seat if the passenger is 
less than 12 years old or shorter than one 
and a half metres.
Never use the same seat belt to secure more 
than one person.
Never allow a child to travel on your lap.
For more information on Child seats, refer 
to the corresponding section.

In the event of an impact
Depending on the nature and 
seriousness of the impact, the 
pretensioning device may be deployed 
before and independently of the airbags. 
Deployment of the pretensioners is 
accompanied by a slight discharge of 
harmless smoke and a noise, due to the 
activation of the pyrotechnic cartridge 
incorporated in the system.
In all cases, the airbag warning lamp 
comes on.
Following an impact, have the seat belts 
system checked, and if necessary replaced, 
by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

System designed to contribute towards 
improving the safety of the occupants (with 
the exception of the rear centre passenger) 
in the event of violent collisions. The airbags 
supplement the action of the seat belts fitted 
with force limiters (all except the centre rear 
passenger belt).
If a collision occurs, the electronic detectors 
record and analyse the front and side impacts 
sustained in the impact detection zones:
- 

in the case of a serious impact, the airbags 
are deployed instantly and contribute 
towards better protection of the occupants 
of the vehicle (with the exception of the 
rear centre passenger); immediately after 
the impact, the airbags deflate rapidly so 
that they do not hinder visibility or the exit 
of the occupants,
in the case of a minor or rear impact or in 
certain roll-over conditions, the airbags 
may not be deployed; the seat belt 
alone contributes towards ensuring your 
protection in these situations.

- 

Impact detection zones
A.  Front impact zone.
B.  Side impact zone.

The airbags do not operate when the 
ignition is switched off.
This equipment will only deploy once. 
If a second impact occurs (during the 
same or a subsequent accident), the 
airbag will not be deployed again.

Deployment of one or more of the 
airbags is accompanied by a slight 
emission of smoke and a noise, due 
to the activation of the pyrotechnic 
cartridge incorporated in the system.
This smoke is not harmful, but sensitive 
individuals may experience slight 
irritation.
The noise of detonation associated with 
the deployment of one or more airbags 
may result in a slight loss of hearing for 
a short time.

5SafetyFront airbags

System which protects the driver and front 
passenger in the event of a serious front impact 
in order to limit the risk of injury to the head and 
thorax.
The driver's airbag is fitted in the centre of the 
steering wheel; the front passenger's airbag is 
fitted in the dashboard above the glove box.

Deployment
The airbags are deployed, except the 
passenger's front airbag if it is deactivated, in the 
event of a serious front impact to all or part of the 
front impact zone A, in the longitudinal centreline 
of the vehicle on a horizontal plane and directed 
from the front to the rear of the vehicle.
The front airbag inflates between the thorax 
and head of the front occupant of the vehicle 
and the steering wheel, driver's side, and the 
dashboard, passenger's side, to cushion their 
forward movement.

130

Deactivating the passenger's 
front airbag
Only the passenger's front airbag can be 
deactivated.
F  With the ignition off, insert the key in the 

passenger airbag deactivation switch.

F  Turn it to the "OFF" position.
F  Remove the key keeping the switch in the 

new position.

When the ignition is switched on, this 
warning lamp comes in the seat belt 
warning lamps display screen or in 
the instrument panel. It stays on while 
the airbag is deactivated.

To assure the safety of your child, 
the passenger's front airbag must be 
deactivated when you install a rearward 
facing child seat on the front passenger 
seat.
Otherwise, the child would risk being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag 
were deployed.

Reactivating the passenger's 
front airbag
When you remove a rearward facing child 
seat, with the ignition off, turn the switch to 
the "ON" position to reactivate the airbag and 
so assure the safety of your front passenger in 
the event of an impact.

Operating fault

When the ignition is switched on, 
this warning lamp comes on in the 
seat belt warning lamps display 
screen or in the instrument panel for 
approximately one minute to signal 
that the front airbag is activated.

If this warning lamp comes on in the 
instrument panel, you must contact a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop 
without delay to have the system 
checked. The airbags may no longer be 
deployed in the event of a serious impact.

SafetyLateral airbags

Impact detection zones
A.  Front impact zone.
B.  Side impact zone.

System which protects the driver and front 
passenger in the event of a serious side impact 
in order to limit the risk of injury to the chest, 
between the hip and the shoulder.
Each lateral airbag is fitted in the seat backrest 
frame, door side.

Deployment
A lateral airbag is deployed unilaterally in the 
event of a serious side impact applied to all or 
part of the side impact zone B, perpendicular 
to the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle on a 
horizontal plane and directed from the outside 
towards the inside of the vehicle.
The lateral airbag inflates between the hip and 
shoulder of the front occupant of the vehicle 
and the corresponding door trim panel.

131

5SafetyCurtain airbags
System contributing towards greater protection 
for the driver and passengers (with the 
exception of the rear centre passenger) in the 
event of a serious side impact in order to limit 
the risk of injury to the side of the head.
Each curtain airbag is built into the pillars and 
the upper passenger compartment area.

Deployment
The curtain airbag is deployed at the same 
time as the corresponding lateral airbag in the 
event of a serious side impact applied to all or 
part of the side impact zone B, perpendicular 
to the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle on a 
horizontal plane and directed from the outside 
towards the inside of the vehicle.
The curtain airbag inflates between the front or 
rear occupant of the vehicle and the windows.

Operating fault

If this warning lamp comes on in the 
instrument panel, you must contact 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked.

The airbags may no longer be deployed in the 
event of a serious impact.

In the event of a minor impact or bump 
on the side of the vehicle or if the 
vehicle rolls over, the airbags may not 
be deployed.
In the event of a rear or front collision, 
none of the lateral airbags is deployed.

132

SafetyAdvice
For the airbags to be fully effective, observe the safety recommendations below:
Sit in a normal upright position.
Wear a correctly adjusted seat belt.
Do not leave anything between the 
occupants and the airbags (a child, pet, 
object...), nor fix or attach anything close to 
the inflation trajectory of the airbags; this 
could cause injuries during their deployment.
Never modify the original definition of your 
vehicle, particularly in the area directly 
around the airbags.
After an accident or if the vehicle has been 
stolen or broken into, have the airbag 
systems checked.
All work on the airbag system must be 
carried out by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
Even if all of the precautions mentioned 
are observed, a risk of injury or of minor 
burns to the head, chest or arms when an 
airbag is deployed cannot be ruled out. The 
bag inflates almost instantly (within a few 
milliseconds) then deflates within the same 
time discharging the hot gas via openings 
provided for this purpose.

Front airbags
Do not drive holding the steering wheel by its 
spokes or resting your hands on the centre 
part of the wheel.
Passengers must not place their feet on the 
dashboard.
Do not smoke as deployment of the airbags 
can cause burns or the risk of injury from a 
cigarette or pipe.
Never remove or pierce the steering wheel or 
hit it violently.
Do not fit or attach anything to the steering 
wheel, the dashboard or the passenger's 
sun visor as this could cause injuries with 
deployment of the airbags.

Curtain airbags
Do not fix or attach anything to the roof. This 
could cause injury to the head if the curtain 
airbag is deployed.
If fitted on your vehicle, do not remove the 
grab handles installed on the roof, they play 
a part in securing the curtain airbags.

Lateral airbags
Use only approved covers on the seats, 
compatible with the deployment the lateral 
airbags. For information on the range of seat 
covers suitable for your vehicle, you can 
contact a CITROËN dealer.
Do not fix or attach anything to the seat 
backs (clothing...). This could cause injury 
to the chest or arms if the lateral airbag is 
deployed.
Do not sit with the upper part of the body any 
nearer to the door than necessary.

The vehicle's front door panels include side 
impact sensors.
A damaged door or any unauthorised or 
incorrectly executed work (modification or 
repair) on the front doors or their interior trim 
could compromise the operation of these 
sensors - Risk of malfunction of the lateral 
airbags!
Such work must only be done by a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

5SafetyGeneral points relating to child seats

Although one of CITROËN's main criteria when designing your vehicle, the safety of your children 
also depends on you.

For maximum safety, please observe the 
following recommendations:
- 

in accordance with European regulations, 
all children under the age of 12 or less 
than one and a half metres tall must 
travel in approved child seats suited to 
their weight, on seats fitted with a seat 
belt or ISOFIX mountings*,
statistically, the safest seats in your 
vehicle for carrying children are the 
rear seats,
a child weighing less than 9 kg must 
travel in the rearward facing position 
both in the front and in the rear.

- 

- 

134

CITROËN recommends that children 
should travel on the rear seats of your 
vehicle:
- 
- 

rearward facing up to the age of 3,
forward facing over the age of 3.

*  The regulations on carrying children are 

specific to each country. Refer to the 
legislation in force in your country.

Safety"ISOFIX" mountings

Your vehicle has been approved in accordance 
with the latest ISOFIX regulation.
The seats, represented below, are fitted with 
regulation ISOFIX mountings:

There are three rings for each seat:

- 

two rings A, located between the vehicle 
seat back and cushion, indicated by a 
marking,

- 

a ring B, located behind the seat and 
identified by a marking, referred to as the 
Top Tether for fixing the upper strap.

This ISOFIX mounting system provides fast, 
reliable and safe fitting of the child seat in your 
vehicle.
The ISOFIX child seats are fitted with two 
latches which are secured on the two rings A.

Some seats also have an upper strap, known 
as the Top Tether, which is attached to ring B.

- 

To secure the child seat to the TOP TETHER:
remove and stow the head restraint before 
- 
installing the child seat on the seat (refit it 
once the child seat has been removed),
pass the upper strap of the child seat 
behind the seat backrest, between the 
apertures for the head restraint rods,
fix the hook of the upper strap to the ring B,
tighten the upper strap.

- 
- 
When fitting an ISOFIX child seat to the left-
hand rear seat, before fitting the seat, first 
move the centre rear seat belt towards the 
middle of the vehicle, so as to avoid the seat 
interfering with the operation of the seat belt.

The incorrect installation of a child seat 
in a vehicle compromises the child's 
protection in the event of an accident.
Follow strictly the fitting instructions 
provided by with the child seat.

SafetyAdvice
The incorrect installation of a child seat in a 
vehicle compromises the child's protection in 
the event of an accident.
Ensure that there is no seat belt or seat belt 
buckle under the child seat, as this could 
destabilise it.
Remember to fasten the seat belts or the 
child seat harnesses keeping the slack 
relative to the child's body to a minimum, 
even for short journeys.
When installing a child seat using the seat 
belt, ensure that the seat belt is tightened 
correctly on the child seat and that it secures 
the child seat firmly on the seat of your 
vehicle. If your passenger seat is adjustable, 
move it forwards if necessary.
At rear seating positions, always leave 
sufficient space between the front seat and:
- 
- 

a rearward facing child seat,
the child's feet for a child seat fitted 
forward facing.

To do this, move the front seat forwards 
and, if necessary, move its backrest into the 
upright position.

For optimum installation of the forward facing 
child seat, ensure that the back of the child 
seat is as close as possible to the backrest 
of the vehicle's seat, in contact if possible.
You must remove the head restraint before 
installing a child seat with backrest to a 
passenger seat.
Ensure that the head restraint is stored or 
attached securely to prevent it from being 
thrown around the vehicle in the event of 
sharp braking. Refit the head restraint when 
the child seat is removed.

Children at the front
The legislation on carrying children on the 
front passenger seat is specific to each 
country. Refer to the legislation in force in 
your country.
Deactivate the passenger's front airbag 
when a rearward facing child seat is installed 
on the front passenger seat.
Otherwise, the child risks being seriously 
injured or killed if the airbag is deployed.

Installing a booster seat
The chest part of the seat belt must be 
positioned on the child's shoulder without 
touching the neck.
Ensure that the lap part of the seat belt 
passes correctly over the child's thighs.
CITROËN recommends the use of a booster 
seat which has a back, fitted with a seat belt 
guide at shoulder level.

As a safety precaution, do not leave:
- 

a child or children alone and 
unsupervised in a vehicle,
a child or an animal in a vehicle which 
is exposed to the sun, with the windows 
closed,
the keys within reach of children inside 
the vehicle.

- 

- 

To prevent accidental opening of the doors 
and rear windows, use the child lock.
Take care not to open the rear windows by 
more than one third.
To protect young children from the rays of 
the sun, fit side blinds on the rear windows.

SafetyDriving recommendations

Observe the driving regulations and remain 
vigilant whatever the traffic conditions.
Pay close attention to the traffic and keep your 
hands on the wheel so that you are ready to 
react at any time to any eventuality.
As a safety precaution, the driver must only 
carry out actions requiring sustained attention 
when the vehicle is stationary.
On a long journey, a break every two hours is 
strongly recommended.
In difficult weather, drive smoothly, anticipate 
the need to brake and increase the distance 
from other vehicles.

Driving on flooded  
roads
We strongly advise against driving on flooded 
roads, as this could cause serious damage 
to the engine or gearbox, as well as to the 
electrical systems of your vehicle.

If you are obliged to drive through water:

Important!

- 

- 
- 

- 

check that the depth of water does not 
exceed 15 cm, taking account of waves 
that might be generated by other users,
deactivate the Stop & Start system,
drive as slowly as possible without 
stalling. In all cases, do not exceed 6 mph 
(10 km/h),
do not stop and do not switch off the 
engine.

On leaving the flooded road, as soon as 
circumstances allow, make several light brake 
applications to dry the brake discs and pads.
If in doubt on the state of your vehicle, contact 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.

Never drive with the parking brake 
applied - Risk of overheating and 
damage to the braking system!
Risk of fire!
As the exhaust system of your vehicle 
is very hot, even several minutes after 
switching off the engine, do not park 
or leave the engine running over areas 
where inflammable substances and 
materials are present: grass, leaves, 
etc.

Never leave a vehicle unsupervised 
with the engine running. If you have 
to leave your vehicle with the engine 
running, apply the parking brake 
and put the gearbox into neutral or 
position N or P, depending on the type 
of gearbox.

151

6DrivingWhen towing
Distribution of loads
F  Distribute the load in the trailer so that the 
heaviest items are as close as possible to 
the axle and the nose weight approaches 
the maximum permitted without 
exceeding it.

Air density decreases with altitude, thus 
reducing engine performance. Above 
1 000 metres, the maximum towed load must 
be reduced by 10 % for every 1 000 metres of 
altitude.
For more information on Weights, refer to the 
corresponding section.

Side wind
F  Take into account the increased sensitivity 

to side wind.

Cooling
Towing a trailer on a slope increases the 
temperature of the coolant.
As the fan is electrically controlled, its cooling 
capacity is not dependent on the engine speed.
F  To lower the engine speed, reduce your 

speed.

The maximum towed load on a long incline 
depends on the gradient and the exterior 
temperature.
In all cases, keep a check on the coolant 
temperature.

F 

If the warning lamp and the 
STOP warning lamp come on, 
stop the vehicle and switch off 
the engine as soon as possible.

Braking
Towing a trailer increases the braking distance.
To avoid overheating of the brakes, the use of 
engine braking is recommended.

Tyres
F  Check the tyre pressures of the towing 
vehicle and of the trailer, observing the 
recommended pressures.

Lighting
F  Check the electrical lighting and signalling 

on the trailer and the headlamp beam 
height of your vehicle.

For more information on Adjusting the 
headlamp beam height, refer to the 
corresponding section.

If the exterior temperature is high, it 
is recommended that the engine be 
allowed to idle for 1 to 2 minutes after 
the vehicle comes to a stop, to facilitate 
its cooling.

The rear parking sensors will be 
deactivated automatically to avoid the 
audible signal if a genuine CITROËN 
towbar is used.

DrivingStarting / Switching off the engine with the key
Ignition switch

Anti-theft protection
Electronic engine immobiliser
The keys contain an electronic chip which has 
a secret code. When the ignition is switched 
on, this code must be recognised in order for 
starting to be possible.
This electronic engine immobiliser locks the 
engine management system a few minutes 
after the ignition is switched off and prevents 
starting of the engine by anyone who does not 
have the key.
In the event of a malfunction, you are informed 
by a message in the instrument panel screen.

In this case, your vehicle does not start; contact 
a CITROËN dealer if required.

For reasons of safety and theft protection, 
do not leave your electronic key in the 
vehicle, even when you are close to it.
It is recommended that you keep it on 
your person.

- 

- 

It has 3 positions:
- 

position 1 (Stop): insert and removing the 
key, steering column locked,
position 2 (Ignition on): steering column 
unlocked, ignition on, Diesel preheating, 
engine running,
position 3 (Starting).

Ignition on position
It allows the use of the vehicle's electric 
equipment or portable devices to be charged.
Once the state of charge of the battery drops 
to the reserve level, the system switches to 
energy economy mode: the power supply is 
cut off automatically to preserve the remaining 
battery charge.

Avoid attaching heavy objects to the 
key or the remote control, which would 
weigh down on its blade in the ignition 
switch and could cause a malfunction.
It could adversely affect the deployment 
of the front airbag.

Switching off the engine leads to a loss 
of braking assistance.

153

6DrivingStarting the engine
With the parking brake applied and the gearbox 
in neutral or position N or P:
F  depress the clutch pedal fully (manual 

gearbox),
or

 
F  press the brake pedal firmly (automatic 

F 

gearbox),
insert the key into the ignition switch; the 
system recognises the code,

F  unlock the steering column by simultaneously 

turning the steering and the key.

In certain cases, you may have to apply 
more force to the steering (wheels on 
full lock, for example).

F  With a petrol engine, operate the starter 

motor by turning the key to position 3 
without pressing the accelerator pedal, 
until the engine starts. Once the engine is 
running, release the key.

F  With a Diesel engine, turn the key to 
position 2, ignition on, to operate the 
engine pre-heating system.

Wait until this warning lamp goes off in the 
instrument panel then operate the starter 
motor by turning the key to position 3 
without pressing the accelerator pedal, 
until the engine starts. Once the engine is 
running, release the key.

In wintry conditions, the warning lamp 
can stay on for a longer period. When 
the engine is hot, the warning lamp 
does not come on.

If the engine does not start straight 
away, switch off the ignition. Wait a 
few moments before operating the 
starter motor again. If the engine does 
not start after several attempts, do not 
keep trying: you risk damaging the 
starter motor or the engine. Contact 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

154

In temperate conditions, do not leave 
the engine at idle to warm up but move 
off straight away and drive at moderate 
speed.

Never leave the engine running in 
an enclosed area without adequate 
ventilation: internal combustion 
engines emit toxic exhaust gases, 
such as carbon monoxide. Danger of 
intoxication and death!
In very severe wintry conditions 
(temperatures below -23°C), to ensure 
the correct operation and durability of 
the mechanical components of your 
vehicle, engine and gearbox, it is 
necessary to leave the engine running 
for 4 minutes before moving off.

DrivingGear efficiency indicator*

Example:
-  You are in third gear.
-  You press the accelerator pedal.
- 

System which reduces fuel consumption by recommending the most appropriate gear.
Operation
Depending on the driving situation and your 
vehicle's equipment, the system may advise 
you to skip one (or more) gear(s). You can 
follow this instruction without engaging the 
intermediate gears.
The gear engagement recommendations must 
not be considered compulsory. Indeed, the 
configuration of the road, the amount of traffic 
and safety remain determining factors when 
choosing the best gear. Therefore, the driver 
remains responsible for deciding whether or not 
to follow the advice given by the system.
This function cannot be deactivated.

The system may suggest that you engage 
a higher gear.

The information appears in the instrument 
panel in the form of an arrow.

With an automatic gearbox, the system 
is only active in manual mode.

On certain BlueHDi Diesel versions with 
manual gearbox, the system may suggest 
changing into neutral so that the engine can go 
into standby (STOP mode with Stop & Start) 
in certain driving conditions. In this case, N is 
displayed in the instrument panel.

* Depending on engine.

The system adapts its gear change 
recommendation according to the 
driving conditions (slope, load, etc.) 
and the demands of the driver (power, 
acceleration, braking, etc.).
The system never suggests:
- 
- 
- 

engaging first gear,
engaging reverse gear,
changing down.

On vehicle fitted with a manual gearbox, 
the arrow may be accompanied by the 
gear recommended.

6DrivingHill start assist

System which keeps your vehicle immobilised 
temporarily (approximately 2 seconds) when 
starting on a gradient, the time it takes to 
move your foot from the brake pedal to the 
accelerator pedal.
It only operates when:
- 

the vehicle is completely stationary, with 
your foot on the brake pedal,
particular conditions on a slope are met,
the driver’s door is closed.

- 
- 
This hill start assist system cannot be 
deactivated.

Do not leave the vehicle while it is being 
held in the hill start assist phase.
If you need to get out of the vehicle with 
the engine running, apply the parking 
brake manually. Then check that the 
parking brake indicator lamp is on (but 
not flashing) in the instrument panel.

On an ascending slope, with the vehicle 
stationary, the vehicle is held momentarily 
when you release the brake pedal.
With a manual gearbox, if you are in first gear 
or neutral.
With an automatic gearbox, if you are in 
position D or M.

On a descending slope, with the vehicle 
stationary and reverse gear engaged, the 
vehicle is held momentarily when you 
release the brake pedal.

Operating fault

166

If a fault in the system occurs, this warning 
lamp comes on accompanied by a message. 
Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked.

DrivingStop & Start

The Stop & Start system puts the engine 
temporarily into standby - STOP mode - during 
stops in the traffic (red lights, traffic jams, etc.). 
The engine restarts automatically - START 
mode - as soon as you want to move off. 
The restart takes place instantly, quickly and 
silently.
Perfect for urban use, the Stop & Start system 
reduces fuel consumption and exhaust 
emissions as well as the noise level when 
stationary.

For your comfort, during parking 
maoeuvres, STOP mode is not 
available for a few seconds after 
coming out of reverse gear.
Stop & Start does not affect the 
operation of vehicle systems such as 
braking, power steering, etc.

Never refuel with the engine in STOP 
mode; you must switch off the ignition.

Going into engine STOP mode

With a manual gearbox, vehicle 
stationary, this warning lamp 
comes on in the instrument panel 
and the engine goes into standby

DrivingSpeed limit recognition

Principles

This system allows the speed limit detected by 
the camera to be displayed in the instrument 
panel.
Specific speed limits, such as those for heavy 
goods vehicles, are not displayed.
The display of the speed limit in the instrument 
panel is updated as you pass a speed limit sign 
intended for cars (light vehicles).

The units for the speed limits (mph or 
km/h) depend on the country you are 
driving in.
It should be taken into account so that 
you observe the speed limit.
For the system to operate correctly 
when you change country, the units for 
speed in the instrument panel must be 
those for the country you are driving in.

Using a camera at the top of the windscreen, 
this system detects and reads speed limit and 
end of speed limit signs.
The system also takes account of information 
on speed limits from the navigation system 
mapping.

The automatic reading of road signs is a 
driving assistance system and does not 
always display speed limits correctly.
The speed limit signs present on the 
road always take priority over the 
display by the system.
The system cannot in any 
circumstances replace the need for 
vigilance on the part of the driver.
The driver must observe the driving 
regulations and must adapt the speed 
of the vehicle to suit the weather and 
traffic.
It is possible for the system to not 
display the speed limit if it does not 
detect a speed limit sign within a preset 
period.
The system is designed to detect signs 
that conform to the Vienna Convention 
on road signs.

It is necessary to update your 
navigation mapping regularly in order to 
receive accurate information on speed 
limits from the system.

To maintain correct operation of the 
system: regularly clean the area in front 
of the camera.

171

6DrivingActivation / Deactivation
The system is activated or deactivated via the 
vehicle configuration menu.

each country.
The system does not take account of reduced 
speed limits in the following cases:
- 
- 
- 
- 

poor weather (rain, snow),
atmospheric pollution,
trailer, caravan,
driving with a space-saver type spare 
wheel or snow chains fitted,
puncture repair using the temporary 
repair kit,
young drivers,
...

- 

- 
- 

The system may be disrupted or not work at all 
in the following situations:
- 

poor visibility (inadequate street lighting, 
falling snow, rain, fog),

- 
- 
- 

-  windscreen area ahead of the camera dirty, 
misty, frosty, covered with snow, damaged 
or masked by a sticker,
fault with the camera,
obsolete or incorrect mapping,
hidden road signs (other vehicles, 
vegetation, snow),
speed limit signs that do not conform to the 
standard, are damaged or distorted.

- 

Memorising the speed setting
This memorisation is in addition to the display 
of Speed limit recognition.

The driver can choose to adapt the speed 
setting to the speed limit suggested, by 
pressing the memorisation button at the speed 
limiter / cruise control switch.
This speed setting then replaces the previous

DrivingOperating fault

Flashing dashes indicate a fault with the cruise 
control system.
Have it checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

Only use the cruise control if the traffic 
conditions will allow you to drive for a 
certain time at a steady speed and at a 
safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
Do not activate the cruise control in 
urban areas, in heavy traffic, on winding 
or steep roads, on slippery or flooded 
roads, or in conditions of poor visibility 
(heavy rain, fog, falling snow, etc.).
In some circumstances, it may not be 
possible to maintain or reach the cruise 
speed set: towing, vehicle heavily 
loaded, steep climb, etc.

The use of mats not approved by 
CITROËN may interfere with the 
operation of the cruise control.
To avoid any risk of jamming of the 
pedals:
- 

ensure that the mat is positioned 
correctly,
never fit one mat on top of another.

6DrivingFatigue detection system

It is recommended that you take a break as soon as you feel tired or at least every two hours.

Driving time warning
The system triggers an alert once it detects that 
the driver has not taken a break after two hours 
of driving at a speed above 40 mph (65 km/h).

Activation / Deactivation
The system is activated or deactivated via the 
vehicle configuration menu.
For more information on the menu, refer to the 
part covering your screen in the "Dashboard 
instruments" section.

The state of the system stays in memory when 
the ignition is switched off.

The system cannot in any 
circumstances replace the need for 
vigilance on the part of the driver.
Do not take the wheel if you are tired.

This alert takes the form of the display of a 
message encouraging you to take a break, 
accompanied by an audible signal.
If the driver does not follow this advice, the 
alert is repeated hourly until the vehicle is 
stopped.

182

The system resets itself if one of the following 
conditions is met:
- 

engine running, the vehicle has been 
stationary for more than 15 minutes,
the ignition has been switched off for a 
few minutes,
the driver's seat belt is unfastened and 
their door is open.

- 

- 

As soon as the speed of the vehicle 
drops below 40 mph (65 km/h), the 
system goes into standby.
The driving time is counted again once 
the speed is above 40 mph (65 km/h).

DrivingLane Departure Warning System

System which, using a camera which 
recognises solid or broken lines, detects the 
involuntary crossing of longitudinal traffic lane 
markings on the ground.
To provide safe driving, the camera analyses 
the image then, if the driver's attention drops 
and the speed is higher than 37 mph (60 km/h), 
triggers a warning if there is an unexpected 
change of direction.
This system is particularly useful on motorways 
and main roads.

This system is a driving aid that cannot, 
in any circumstances, replace the need 
for vigilance on the part of the driver.

Activation / Deactivation

Operating fault

Activation and deactivation of the 
function is done by pressing this 
button.

The indicator lamp in the button indicates the 
status of the function:
-  On: the function is activated.
-  Off: the function is deactivated.

The status of the system remains in memory 
when the ignition is switched off.

Detection

If an unexpected change of direction 
is detected, you are alerted by 
this warning lamp flashing in the 
instrument panel and an audible 
signal.

No warning is transmitted if a direction indicator 
is active and for approximately 20 seconds 
after the direction indicator is switched off.

In the event of a fault, this 
warning lamp flashes for approximately 
10 seconds then switches off.

Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

The detection may be impeded:
- 

if the markings on the ground are 
worn,
if there is little contrast between the 
markings on the ground and the 
road surface,
if the windscreen is dirty,
in certain weather conditions: fog, 
heavy rain, snow, shade, bright 
sunlight or direct exposure to the 
sun (low sun, leaving a tunnel, etc.).

- 
- 

183

6DrivingBlind Spot Monitoring System

This system warns the driver of the presence of 
another vehicle in the blind spot angle of their 
vehicle (areas masked from the driver's field 
of vision), as soon as this presents a potential 
danger.

A fixed warning lamp appears in the door mirror 
on the side in question:
- 
- 

immediately, when being overtaken,
after a delay of about one second, when 
overtaking a vehicle slowly.

This system is designed to improve safety when driving and is in no circumstances a 
substitute for the use of the interior rear view mirror and door mirrors. It is the driver's 
responsibility to constantly check the traffic, to assess the distances and relative speeds of 
other vehicles and to predict their movements before deciding whether to change lane.
This system is a driving aid that cannot, in any circumstances, replace the need for 
vigilance on the part of the driver.

184

Activation / Deactivation
Activation and deactivation of the system is 
done in the vehicle configuration menu.

This indicator lamp comes on in the 
instrument panel.

Sensors fitted in the front and rear bumpers 
monitor the blind spots.

To deactivate the system, go to the vehicle 
configuration menu again.
The indicator lamp goes off.

The status of the system remains in memory on 
switching off the ignition.

The system is automatically deactivated 
when towing with a towbar approved by 
CITROËN.

DrivingOperation
The alert is given by a warning lamp which 
comes on in the door mirror on the side in 
question as soon as a vehicle - car, lorry, 
bicycle - is detected.
The following conditions must be met for this:
- 

all vehicles are moving in the same 
direction and in adjacent lanes,
the speed of your vehicle is between 7 and 
87 mph (12 and 140 km/h),
you overtake a vehicle with a speed 
difference of less than 6 mph (10 km/h),
a vehicle overtakes you with a speed 
difference of less than 16 mph (25 km/h),
the traffic is flowing normally,
in the case of an overtaking manoeuvre, 
if this is prolonged and the vehicle being 
overtaken remains in the blind spot,
you are driving on a straight or slightly 
curved road,
your vehicle is not pulling a trailer, a 
caravan, etc.

- 

- 

- 

- 
- 

- 

- 

No alert will be given in the following situations:
- 

in the presence of non-moving objects 
(parked vehicles, barriers, street lamps, 
road signs, etc.),

-  with vehicles moving in the opposite 

direction,
driving on a winding road or a sharp corner,

- 

-  when overtaking (or being overtaken by) a 
very long vehicle (lorry, coach, etc.) which 
is at the same time detected at the rear 
in the blind spot angle and present in the 
driver's forward field of vision,
in very heavy traffic: vehicles detected in 
front and behind are confused with a lorry 
or a stationary object,

- 

-  when overtaking quickly.

185

6DrivingOperating fault

In the event of a fault, this warning 
lamp flashes for a few moments in 
the instrument panel, accompanied 
by illumination of the Service warning 
lamp and the display of a message.

Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked.

The system may suffer temporary 
interference in certain weather 
conditions (rain, hail, etc.).
In particular, driving on a wet surface 
or moving from a dry area to a wet area 
can cause false alerts (for example, the 
presence of a fog of water droplets in 
the blind spot angle is interpreted as a 
vehicle).
In bad or wintry weather, ensure that 
the sensors are not covered by mud, 
ice or snow.
Take care not to cover the warning zone 
in the door mirrors or the detection 
zones on the front and rear bumpers 
with adhesive labels or other objects; 
they may hamper the correct operation 
of the system.

High pressure jet wash
When washing your vehicle, direct the 
lance at least 30 cm away from the 
sensors.

186

DrivingParking sensors

Rear parking sensors
The system is switched on by engaging reverse 
gear.
This is confirmed by an audible signal.
The system is switched off when you come out 
of reverse gear.

This system indicates the proximity of an 
obstacle (e.g. pedestrian, vehicle, tree, gate) 
which comes within the field of detection of 
sensors located in the bumper.
Certain types of obstacle (e.g. stake, 
roadworks cone) detected initially will no longer 
be detected at the end of the manoeuvre, if 
they are located in blind spots in the sensors' 
field of detection.

This system cannot in any circumstances replace 
the need for vigilance on the part of the driver.

Audible assistance
The proximity information is given by an 
intermittent audible signal, the frequency of 
which increases as the vehicle approaches the 
obstacle.
The sound emitted by the speaker (right-hand 
or left-hand) indicates the side on which the 
obstacle is located.
When the distance between the vehicle and 
the obstacle becomes less than approximately 
thirty centimetres, the audible signal becomes 
continuous.

Visual assistance
This supplements the audible signal by 
displaying bars in the screen which move 
progressively nearer to the vehicle.
When the obstacle is very close, the "Danger" 
symbol is displayed in the screen.

187

6DrivingDeactivation / Activation
Deactivation or activation of the system is done 
via the vehicle configuration menu.

The system will be deactivated 
automatically if a trailer is being 
towed or a bicycle carrier is fitted on 
a towbar (vehicle fitted with a towbar 
installed in line with the manufacturer's 
recommendations).

Operating fault

In the event of a fault, when reverse 
gear is engaged, this warning lamp 
lights up in the instrument panel, 
accompanied by a message and an 
audible signal.

Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked.

In bad or wintry weather, ensure that 
the sensors are not covered with mud, 
ice or snow. When reverse gear is 
engaged, an audible signal (long beep) 
indicates that the sensors may be dirty.
Certain sound sources (motorcycle, 
lorry, pneumatic drill, etc.) may trigger 
the audible signals of the parking 
sensor system.

High pressure jet wash
When washing your vehicle, do not 
direct the lance within 30 cm of the 
sensors.

188

DrivingReversing camera

The reversing camera is activated automatically 
when reverse gear is engaged.
The image is displayed in the touch screen.

The reversing camera function may be 
supplemented with parking sensors.

The reversing camera cannot, in any 
circumstances, replace the need for 
vigilance on the part of of the driver.

The blue lines represent the general direction 
of the vehicle (the gap represents the width of 
your vehicle except for the door mirrors).
The red lines represent a distance of about 
30 cm beyond the edge of your vehicle's rear 
bumper.
The green lines represent distances of  
about 1 and 2 metres beyond the edge of your 
vehicle's rear bumper.

It is normal to see part of the number plate 
displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Opening the tailgate causes the display 
to disappear.

Clean the reversing camera regularly 
using a soft, dry cloth.

High pressure jet washing
When washing your vehicle, do not 
direct the lance within 30 cm of the 
camera lens.

189

6DrivingUnder-inflation detection

System which automatically checks the pressures of the tyres while driving.

The system monitors the pressures in the four 
tyres, once the vehicle is moving.
It compares the information given by the four 
wheel speed sensors with reference values, 
which must be reinitialised every time the 
tyre pressures are adjusted or a wheel 
changed.
The system triggers an alert as soon as it 
detects a drop in the inflation pressure of one 
or more tyres.

The under-inflation detection system 
does not replace the need for vigilance 
on the part of the driver.
This system does not avoid the need to 
check the tyre pressures (including the 
spare wheel) every month as well as 
before a long journey.
Driving with under-inflated tyres impairs 
road holding, extends braking distances 
and causes premature tyre wear, 
particularly under arduous conditions 
(high loading, high speed, long journey).

Driving with under-inflated tyres 
increases fuel consumption.

The inflation pressures defined for 
your vehicle can be found on the tyre 
pressure label.
For more information on the 
Identification markings, refer to the 
corresponding section.

Checking tyre pressures
This check should be done when 
the tyres are "cold" (vehicle stopped 
for 1 hour or after a journey of less than 
6 miles (10 km) at moderate speeds).
Otherwise, add 0.3 bar to the pressures 
shown on the label.

Snow chains
The system does not have to be 
reinitialised after fitting or removing 
snow chains.

DrivingUnder-inflation alert

This is given by fixed illumination of 
this warning lamp, accompanied by 
an audible signal and, depending on 
equipment, the display of a message.

F  Reduce speed immediately, avoid 

excessive steering movements and sudden 
braking.

F  Stop the vehicle as soon as it is safe to 

do so.

The loss of pressure detected does not 
always cause visible bulging of the tyre.
Do not satisfy yourself with just a visual 
check.

F 

F 

or
F 

If you have a compressor, such as the one 
in the temporary puncture repair kit, check 
the pressures of the four tyres when cold.
If it is not possible to make this check 
immediately, drive carefully at reduced 
speed.

In the event of a puncture, use the 
temporary puncture repair kit or the spare 
wheel (depending on equipment).

The alert is maintained until the system 
is reinitialised.

Reinitialisation
It is necessary to reinitialise the system every 
time one or more tyre pressures are adjusted, 
and after changing one or more wheels.

Before reinitialising the system, ensure 
that the pressures of the four tyres are 
correct for the use of the vehicle and in 
line with the recommendations on the 
tyre pressure label.
The under-inflation alert can only 
be relied on if the reinitialisation of 
the system has been done with the 
pressures in the four tyres correctly 
adjusted.
The under-inflation detection system 
does not give a warning if a pressure is 
incorrect at the time of reinitialisation.

7Practical informationFuel tank

Capacity of the tank:
-  Petrol: approximately 45 litres.
-  Diesel: approximately 42 or 50 litres (depending on version).
Low fuel level

Refuelling
A label on the inside of the fuel filler flap 
reminds you of the type of fuel to use, 
depending on your engine type.
Additions of fuel must be of at least 5 litres to 
be registered by the fuel gauge.

When the low fuel level is reached, 
this warning lamp in the instrument 
panel comes on, accompanied by 
an audible warning, a message and 
the last bar of the fuel gauge flashes 
in red.

When it first comes on, about 5 litres of fuel 
remain in the tank.
Until sufficient fuel has been added, this 
warning lamp appears every time the ignition 
is switched on, accompanied by an audible 
warning and a message. This audible warning 
and message are repeated with increasing 
frequency as the fuel level drops towards "0".
Refuel as soon as possible to avoid running 
out.

For more information on Running 
out of fuel (Diesel), refer to the 
corresponding section.

196

Opening the filler cap may result in an inrush of 
air. This is entirely normal and results from the 
sealing of the fuel system.

If your vehicle is fitted with Stop & Start, 
never refuel with the engine in STOP 
mode; you must switch off the ignition 
using the key, or the START/STOP 
button if your vehicle has Keyless Entry 
and Starting.

To refuel in complete safety:
F  You must switch off the engine.
F  Open the filler flap.
F  Take care to select the pump that delivers 

F 

the correct type of fuel for your vehicle.
Introduce the key into the cap then turn it to 
the left, or turn the cap manually to the left 
(depending on version).

Practical informationIf you are filling your tank to the top, do not 
persist after the 3rd cut-off; this could cause 
malfunctions.
Your vehicle is fitted with a catalytic converter, 
which helps to reduce the level of harmful 
emissions in the exhaust gases.
For petrol engines, you must use unleaded 
fuel.
The filler neck is narrower, allowing only 
unleaded petrol nozzles to be introduced.

If you have put in the wrong fuel 
for your vehicle, you must have the 
fuel tank drained and filled with 
the correct fuel before starting the 
engine.

Fuel cut-off

Your vehicle is equipped with a safety device 
which cuts off the fuel supply in the event of a 
collision.

F  Remove the cap and place it on its support 

F 

(on the filler flap).
Introduce the filler nozzle and push it in as 
far as possible before starting to refuel (risk 
of blowback).

F  Maintain this position throughout the 

refuelling operation.

Once you have finished refuelling:
F  Refit the filler cap.
F  Turn the key to the right then remove it 

from the cap, or turn the cap manually to 
the right (depending on version).

F  Push the fuel flap to close it.

197

7Practical informationMisfuel prevention (Diesel)*

Mechanical device which prevents filling the tank of a Diesel vehicle with petrol. It avoids the risk of 
engine damage that can result from filling with the wrong fuel.
Operation

It remains possible to use a fuel can to 
fill the tank.
In order to ensure a good flow of fuel, 
do not place the nozzle of the fuel can 
in direct contact with the flap of the 
misfuel prevention device and pour 
slowly.

When a petrol filler nozzle is introduced into 
the fuel filler neck of a Diesel vehicle, it comes 
into contact with the flap. The system remains 
closed and prevents filling.
Do not persist but introduce a Diesel type 
filler nozzle.

Travelling abroad
As Diesel fuel pump nozzles may 
be different in other countries, the 
presence of the misfuel prevention 
device may make refuelling impossible.
Not all Diesel vehicles are fitted with 
misfuel protection, so before travelling 
abroad, we recommend that you check 
with the CITROËN dealer network, 
whether your vehicle is suitable for the 
fuel pumps in the country in which you 
intend to travel.

Practical informationChecking levels

Check all of these levels regularly, in line with the manufacturer's service schedule. Top them up if necessary, unless otherwise indicated.
If a level drops significantly, have the corresponding system checked by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.

Take care when working under the 
bonnet, as certain areas of the engine 
may be extremely hot (risk of burns) 
and the cooling fan could start at any 
time (even with the ignition off).

Engine oil level

The check is carried out either when 
the ignition is switched on using the 
oil level indicator in the instrument 
panel for vehicles so equipped, or 
using the dipstick.

To ensure that the reading is correct, 
your vehicle must be parked on a level 
surface with the engine having been off 
for more than 30 minutes.

It is normal to top up the oil level between 
two services (or oil changes). CITROËN 
recommends that you check the level, and top 
up if necessary, every 3 000 miles (5 000 kms).

Checking using the dipstick

The location of the dipstick is shown in the 
corresponding underbonnet layout view.
F  Take the dipstick by its coloured grip and 

remove it completely.

F  Wipe the end of the dipstick using a clean 

non-fluffy cloth.

F  Refit the dipstick and push fully down, then 

pull it out again to make the visual check: 
the correct level is between the marks A 
and B.

A = MAX

B = MIN

If you find that the level is above the A mark or 
below the B mark, do not start the engine.
If the level is above the MAX mark (risk 
- 
of damage to the engine), contact a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.
If the level is below the MIN mark, you 
must top up the engine oil.

- 

Oil grade
Before topping up the oil or changing the oil, 
check that the oil is the correct grade for your 
engine and conforms to the manufacturer's 
recommendations.

209

7Practical informationEngine oil change
Refer to the manufacturer's service schedule 
for details of the interval for this operation.
In order to maintain the reliability of the engine 
and emission control system, never use 
additives in the engine oil.

Brake fluid level

The brake fluid level should be close 
to the "MAX" mark. If it is not, check 
the brake pad wear.

Changing the fluid
Refer to the manufacturer's service schedule 
for details of the interval for this operation.

Fluid specification
The brake fluid must conform to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.

corresponding underbonnet layout view.
F  Unscrew the oil filler cap to reveal the filler 

aperture.

F  Add oil in small quantities, avoiding any 
spills on engine components (risk of fire).
F  Wait a few minutes before checking the 

level again using the dipstick.

F  Add more oil if necessary.
F  After checking the level, carefully refit the 

oil filler cap and the dipstick in its tube.

After topping up the oil, the check when 
switching on the ignition with the oil 
level indicator in the instrument panel 
is not valid during the 30 minutes after 
topping up.

210

Practical informationScreenwash fluid level

Top up the level when necessary.

Fluid specification
For optimum cleaning and to avoid freezing, 
this fluid must not be topped up or replaced 
with plain water.
In wintry conditions, it is recommended that you 
use an ethyl alcohol or methanol based fluid.

When the engine is hot, as the cooling system is 
pressurised, wait at least one hour after switching 
off the engine before carrying out any work.
To avoid the risk of scalding in the event of an 
urgent need to top up, with a cloth around the 
cap, unscrew it by two turns to allow the pressure 
to drop.
Once the pressure has dropped, remove the cap 
and top up the level.

Fluid specification
The coolant must conform to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.

Coolant level

Check the coolant level regularly.
It is normal to top up this fluid 
between services.

To ensure that the measurement is reliable, the 
vehicle must be parked on level ground and the 
engine must be cold.
The coolant level should be close to the "MAX" 
mark but should never exceed it.
If the level is close to or below the "MIN" mark, 
it is essential to top up.
A low coolant level presents a risk of serious 
damage to your engine.

When the engine is hot, the temperature of the 
coolant is regulated by the fan.

The cooling fan may start after 
switching off the engine: take care 
with articles and clothing that might 
be caught by the fan blades.

Most of these fluids are harmful to 
health or indeed very corrosive.

Do not discard used oil or fluids into 
sewers or onto the ground.
Take used oil to a CITROËN dealer or 
a qualified workshop (France) or to an 
authorised waste disposal site.

Practical informationChecking components

Unless otherwise indicated, check these components in accordance with the manufacturer's service schedule and according to your engine.
Otherwise, have them checked by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.
12 V battery

Air filter and passenger compartment filter

Particle filter (Diesel)

The battery does not require any maintenance.
However, check regularly that the terminals 
are correctly tightened (versions without quick 
release terminals) and that the connections 
are clean.

For more information and the precautions to 
take before starting work on the 12 V battery, 
refer to the corresponding section.

Versions equipped with Stop & Start are 
fitted with a 12 V lead-acid battery of 
specific technology and specification.
Its replacement should be carried out 
only by a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

Refer to the manufacturer's 
service schedule for details of the 
replacement intervals for these 
components.

Depending on the environment (e.g. dusty 
atmosphere) and the use of the vehicle (e.g. 
city driving), replace them twice as often if 
necessary.
A clogged passenger compartment filter may 
have an adverse effect on the performance 
of the air conditioning system and generate 
undesirable odours.

Oil filter

Replace the oil filter each time the 
engine oil is changed.
Refer to the manufacturer's 
service schedule for details of 
the replacement interval for this 
component.

The start of saturation of the particle 
filter is indicated by the fixed 
illumination of this warning lamp 
accompanied by a warning message.

As soon as the traffic conditions permit, 
regenerate the filter by driving at a speed of at 
least 40 mph (60 km/h) until the warning lamp 
goes off.
If the warning lamp stays on, this indicates a 
low additive level.
For more information on Checking levels and 
the Diesel additive level in particular, refer to 
the corresponding section.

On a new vehicle, the first particle 
filter regeneration operations may be 
accompanied by a "burning" smell, 
which is perfectly normal.
Following prolonged operation of the 
vehicle at very low speed or at idle, 
you may, in exceptional circumstances, 
notice the emission of water vapour at 
the exhaust on acceleration. This does 
not affect the behaviour of the vehicle 
or the environment.

213

7Practical informationManual gearbox

Brake disc wear

The gearbox does not require any 
maintenance (no oil change).
Refer to the manufacturer's service 
schedule for the checking interval for 
this component.

For information on checking brake 
disc wear, contact a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualified workshop.

Automatic gearbox

Parking brake

The gearbox does not require any 
maintenance (no oil change).
Refer to the manufacturer's service 
schedule for the checking interval for 
this component.

If excessive travel or a loss of 
effectiveness of this system is 
noticed, the parking brake must be 
checked, even between two services.

Checking this system must be done by a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualified workshop.

Only use products recommended by 
CITROËN or products of equivalent 
quality and specification.
In order to optimise the operation of 
units as important as those in the 
braking system, CITROËN selects and 
offers very specific products.
After washing the vehicle, dampness, 
or in wintry conditions, ice can form 
on the brake discs and pads: braking 
efficiency may be reduced. Make light 
brake applications to dry and defrost 
the brakes.

Brake pads

Brake wear depends on the style 
of driving, particularly in the case 
of vehicles used in town, over short 
distances. It may be necessary to 

have the condition of the brakes checked, even 
between vehicle services.
Unless there is a leak in the circuit, a drop in 
the brake fluid level indicates that the brake 
pads are worn.

214

Practical informationAdBlue® and SCR system
for BlueHDi Diesel engines

The AdBlue® is held in a special tank with 
a capacity of about 15 litres: this provides 
a driving range of about 11 000 miles 
(18 000 km). An alert is triggered automatically 
to warn you when the reserve level is 
reached: you can then drive about 1 500 miles 
(2 400 km) before the tank is empty.

To assure respect for the environment and 
conformity with the new Euro 6 emissions 
standard, without adversely affecting the 
performance or fuel consumption of Diesel 
engines, CITROËN has taken the decision to 
equip its vehicles with an effective system that 
associates SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) 
with a particle filter (FAP) for the treatment of 
exhaust gases.

SCR system
Using a fluid called AdBlue® containing urea, a 
catalytic converter turns up to 85% of nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) into nitrogen and water, which are 
harmless to health and the environment.

Once the AdBlue® tank is empty, a 
system required by regulations prevents 
starting of the engine.
If the SCR system is faulty, the level 
of emissions from your vehicle will no 
longer meet the Euro 6 standard: your 
vehicle becomes polluting.
In the event of a confirmed fault 
with the SCR system, you must go 
to a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop as soon as possible: after 
a running distance of 650 miles 
(1 100 km), a system will be triggered 
automatically to prevent engine starting.
In either case, a range indicator gives 
you the distance you can travel before 
the vehicle is immobilised.

Freezing of the AdBlue®
AdBlue® freezes at temperatures below 
around -11°C.
The SCR system includes a heater 
for the AdBlue® tank, allowing you 
to continue driving in all weather 
conditions.

215

7Practical informationTopping up the AdBlue®
Precautions in use
AdBlue® is a urea-based solution. This liquid is 
non-flammable, colourless and odourless (kept 
in a cool area).
In the event of contact with the skin, wash 
the affected area with soap and running 
water. In the event of contact with the eyes, 
wash (irrigate) the eyes with large amounts of 
water or with an eye wash solution for at least 
15 minutes. If a burning sensation or irritation 
persists, get medical attention.
If swallowed, immediately wash out the mouth 
with clean water and then drink plenty of water.
In certain conditions (high exterior temperature, 
for example), the risk of release of ammonia 
cannot be excluded: do not inhale the fluid. 
Ammonia vapour has an irritant effect on 
mucous membranes (eyes, nose and throat).

Keep AdBlue® out of the reach of 
children, in its original container or 
bottle.
Never transfer AdBlue® to another 
container: it would lose its purity.

Use only AdBlue® fluid that meets the 
ISO 22241 standard.

Never dilute AdBlue® with water.
Never pour AdBlue® into the Diesel fuel 
tank.

The supply in a non-drip container or bottle 
simplifies topping up. You can obtain 1.89 litre 
(half a US gallon) bottles or 5 or 10 litre 
containers from a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

Never top up from an AdBlue® 
dispenser reserved for heavy goods 
vehicles.

216

Practical informationRecommendations on storage
AdBlue® freezes at about -11°C and 
deteriorates above 25°C. It is recommended 
that bottles be stored in a cool area and 
protected from direct sunlight.
Under these conditions, the fluid can be kept 
for at least a year.
If the additive has frozen, it can be used once it 
has completely thawed out.

Procedure
Before topping up, ensure that the vehicle is 
parked on a flat and level surface.
In wintry conditions, ensure that the 
temperature of the vehicle is above -11°C. 
Otherwise the AdBlue® may be frozen and 
so cannot be poured into its tank. Park your 
vehicle in a warmer area for a few hours to 
allow the top-up to be carried out.

Never store bottles of AdBlue® in your 
vehicle.

Do not dispose of AdBlue® bottles or 
containers in the household waste.
Place them in a container provided for 
this purpose or take them to your dealer.

217

7Practical informationF  After emptying the bottle, wipe away any 

spillage around the tank filler using a damp 
cloth.

If any fluid is spilt or splashed, wash 
immediately with cold water or wipe with 
a damp cloth.
If the fluid has crystallised, clean it off 
using a sponge and hot water.

Refit the filler cap
F  Refit the blue cap and turn it a quarter of a 

turn clockwise, to its stop.

F  Close the filler flap.

Important: when topping up after 
running out of AdBlue, signalled 
by the message "Top up AdBlue: 
starting impossible", you must wait for 
about 5 minutes before switching the 
ignition on again, without opening the 
driver's door, unlocking the vehicle, 
introducing the remote control key 
into the ignition switch, or placing 
the Keyless Entry and Starting 
electronic key inside the vehicle.
Switch on the ignition, then wait for 
10 seconds before starting the engine.

Top up
F  Obtain a bottle of AdBlue®. After first 

checking the use-by date, read carefully 
the instructions on use on the label before 
pouring the contents of the bottle into your 
vehicle's AdBlue® tank.

Important: if your vehicle's AdBlue® 
tank is completely empty - which is 
confirmed by the alert messages and 
the impossibility of starting the engine - 
you must add at least 4 litres and no 
more than 10 litres.

Practical informationAIRBUMP® protectors

Made of TPU (Thermo Plastic Urethane) and enclosing bubbles of air, they act as an impact 
absorber.
Located on the sides of your vehicle, they protect the bodywork by reducing the effect of minor 
everyday knocks: parking dings, opening doors, scrapes, etc.

Care of the AIRBUMP® 
protectors
The AIRBUMP® protectors require no 
particular care or maintenance.
They are cleaned simply using water or one of 
the products available from CITROËN dealers.
To avoid problems of premature ageing of the 
AIRBUMP® protectors, do not use polish on 
them.

8In the event of a breakdown12 V battery

Procedure for starting the engine using another battery or charging a discharged battery.
General points
Lead-acid starter batteries

Access to the battery

Batteries contain harmful substances 
such as sulphuric acid and lead.
They must be disposed of in 
accordance with regulations and must 
not, in any circumstances, be discarded 
with household waste.
Take used remote control batteries and 
vehicle batteries to a special collection 
point.

If your vehicle has an automatic 
gearbox, do not try to start the engine 
by pushing the vehicle.

Protect your eyes and face before 
handling the battery.
All operations on the battery must be 
carried out in a well ventilated area and 
away from naked flames and sources 
of sparks, so as to avoid the risk of 
explosion or fire.
Wash your hands afterwards.

The battery is located under the bonnet.
For access to the (+) terminal:
F 

release the bonnet using the interior lever, 
then the exterior catch,
raise the bonnet and secure it with its stay.

F 

(+) Positive terminal.
It has a quick-release clamp.

(-) Negative terminal.
As the battery negative terminal is not 
accessible, a remote earth point is located on 
the structure of the front right wing.

248

In the event of a breakdownStarting using another battery
When your vehicle's battery is discharged, the 
engine can be started using a slave battery 
(external or on another vehicle) and jump lead 
cables or a battery booster.

Never try to start the engine by 
connecting a battery charger.
Never use a 24 V or higher battery 
booster.
First check that the slave battery has a 
nominal voltage of 12 V and a capacity 
at least equal to that of the discharged 
battery.
The two vehicles must not be in contact 
with each other.
Switch off the electrical consumers on 
both vehicles (audio system, wipers, 
lighting, ...).
Ensure that the jump lead cables do 
not pass close to moving parts of the 
engine (cooling fan, belts, ...).
Do not disconnect the (+) terminal when 
the engine is running.

F  Raise the plastic cover on the (+) terminal, 

if your vehicle has one.

F  Connect the red cable to the positive 

terminal (+) of the flat battery A (at 
the metal elbow) then to the positive 
terminal (+) of the slave battery B or the 
booster.

F  Connect one end of the green or black 
cable to the negative terminal (-) of the 
slave battery B or the booster (or earth 
point on the other vehicle).

F  Connect the other end of the green or black 

cable to the earth point C on the broken 
down vehicle.

F  Start the engine of the vehicle with the 

good battery and leave it running for a few 
minutes.

F  Operate the starter on the broken down 

 

vehicle and let the engine run.
If the engine does not start straight away, 
switch off the ignition and wait a few 
moments before trying again.

F  Wait until the engine returns to idle then 
disconnect the jump lead cables in the 
reverse order.

F  Refit the plastic cover to the (+) terminal, if 

your vehicle has one.

F  Allow the engine to run for at least 

30 minutes, by driving or with the vehicle 
stationary, so that the battery reaches an 
adequate state of charge.

Some functions, including Stop & Start, 
are not available if the battery is not 
sufficiently charged.

249

8In the event of a breakdownCharging the battery using a battery charger
For optimum service life of the battery, it is 
essential to maintain an adequate state of 
charge.
In some circumstances it may be necessary to 
charge the battery:
- 

if you use your vehicle essentially for short 
journeys,
if the vehicle is to be taken off the road for 
several weeks.

- 

Follow the instructions for use provided 
by the manufacturer of the charger.
Never reverse polarities.

It is not necessary to disconnect the 
battery.

Contact a CITROËN dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

If you envisage charging your vehicle's 
battery yourself, use only a charger 
compatible with lead-acid batteries of a 
nominal voltage of 12 V.

If this label is present, it is essential 
to use only a 12 V charger, to avoid 
causing irreversible damage to the 
electrical components related to the 
Stop & Start system.

250

F  Switch off the ignition.
F  Switch off all electrical consumers (audio 

system, lighting, wipers, ...).

F  Switch off the charger B before connecting 
the cables to the battery, so as to avoid any 
dangerous sparks.

F  Ensure that the charger cables are in good 

condition.

F  Raise the plastic cover, if your vehicle has 

one, on the (+) terminal.

F  Connect the charger B cables as follows:

-  the positive (+) red cable to the (+) 

terminal of the battery A,

-  the negative (-) black cable to the earth 

point C on the vehicle.

F  At the end of the charging operation, switch 
off the charger B before disconnecting the 
cables from the battery A.

Never try to charge a frozen battery.
If the battery has been frozen, have 
it checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop, who will check that 
the internal components have not been 
damaged and the casing is not cracked, 
which could cause a leak of toxic and 
corrosive acid.

In the event of a breakdownDisconnecting the battery
In order to maintain an adequate state 
of charge for starting the engine, it is 
recommended that the battery be disconnected 
if the vehicle is taken out of service for a long 
period.
Before disconnecting the battery:
F  close all openings (doors, boot, windows),
F  switch off all electrical consumers (audio 

system, wipers, lighting, etc.),

F  switch off the ignition and wait for 

four minutes.

At the battery, it is only necessary to 
disconnect the (+) terminal.

Quick-release terminal clamp

Reconnecting the (+) terminal
F  Raise the lever A fully.
F  Refit the open clamp B on the (+) terminal.
F  Push the clamp B fully down.
F  Lower the lever A to lock the clamp B.

Do not force the lever as locking will 
not be possible if the clamp is not 
positioned correctly; start the procedure 
again.

Disconnecting the (+) terminal
F  Raise the lever A fully to release the 

clamp B.

F  Remove the clamp B by lifting it off.

Following reconnection of the battery
After reconnecting the battery, switch on the 
ignition and wait 1 minute before starting to 
allow initialisation of the electronic systems.
However, if minor problems persist following 
this operation, contact a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
Referring to the corresponding section, you 
must yourself initialise or reset certain systems, 
such as:
- 

the remote control or electronic key 
(depending on version),
the electric windows,
the date and time,
the radio preset stations.

- 
- 
- 

The Stop & Start system may not be 
operational during the trip following the 
first engine start.
In this case, the system will only be 
available again after a continuous 
period of immobilisation of the vehicle, 
a period which depends on the exterior 
temperature and the state of charge of 
the battery (up to about 8 hours).

251

8In the event of a breakdownTowing

Procedure for having your vehicle towed or for towing another vehicle using the towing eye.
Access to the tools

General recommendations

253

8In the event of a breakdownEngines
Engine characteristics
The engine characteristics (capacity, maximum 
power, maximum engine speed, fuel, CO2 
emissions, etc.) for your vehicle are given in 
the registration document, as well as in sales 
brochures.
These characteristics correspond to the 
values type-approved on a test bed, under 
conditions defined in European legislation 
(Directive 1999/99/EC).
For more information, contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

Weights
Weights and towed loads
The maximum weights and towed loads for your 
vehicle are given are given in the registration 
document, as well as in sales brochures.
These values are also present on the 
manufacturer's plate or label.
For more information, contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

The kerb weight is equal to the unladen 
weight + driver (75 kg).
The GTW and towed load values indicated 
apply up to a maximum altitude of 
1 000 metres; the towed load mentioned 
must be reduced by 10 % for every additional 
1 000 metres.
The weight of the braked trailer can be 
increased, within the GTW limit, on condition 
that the GVW of the towing vehicle is reduced 
by the same amount.
The recommended nose weight is the vertical 
load on the towbar ball (removable with or 
without tools).
GVW: gross vehicle weight, the maximum 
authorised vehicle weight.
GTW: gross train weight, the maximum 
authorised weight of vehicle plus trailer.

High exterior temperatures may result 
in a reduction in the performance of 
the vehicle to protect the engine; when 
the exterior temperature is higher than 
37 °C, limit the towed weight.

Towing with a lightly loaded vehicle can 
adversely affect roadholding.
Braking distances are increased when 
towing a trailer.
Never exceed 60 mph (100 km/h) when 
towing (comply with the legislation in 
force in your country).

If the exterior temperature is high, it 
is recommended that the engine be 
allowed to idle for 1 to 2 minutes after 
the vehicle comes to a stop, to facilitate 
its cooling.

the maximum authorised vehicle + trailer 
weight (the Gross Train Weight or GTW),
the maximum weight on the front axle,
the maximum weight on the rear axle.

- 
- 
D. Tyres / paint code label.
This label is affixed to the driver's door 
aperture.
It bears the following information on the tyres:
- 
- 

the tyre pressures, unladen and laden,
the reference, size, type, load index and 
speed rating,

the spare tyre pressure.

- 
It also indicates the paint colour code.

The original tyres fitted to the vehicle 
may have a load index or speed rating 
higher than those given on the label; 
this has no effect on the inflation 
pressures.

Checking tyre pressures
The tyre pressures should be checked when 
cold at least monthly.
The pressures given on the label are valid for 
cold tyres. If you have driven for more than 
10 minutes or more than 6 miles (10 kilometres) 
at more than 30 mph (50 km/h), the tyres will be 
warm; in this case 0.3 bar (30 kPa) should be 
added to the pressures given on the label.

Never reduce the pressure of a warm 
tyre.

Low tyre pressures increase fuel 
consumption.

  The different functions and settings 
described vary according to the version 
and configuration of your vehicle.  

  As a safety measure and because it 
requires sustained attention by the 
driver, the pairing of a Bluetooth mobile 
telephone with the Bluetooth hands-
free system of your audio system must 
be done with the  vehicle stationary
and the ignition on.  

  The system is protected in such a way 
that it will only operate in your vehicle. 
 Displaying of the  Energy Economy 
Mode  message signals that a change 
to standby is imminent.

 Voice commands 
      Steering mounted controls 
  Pressing this button activates the 
voice commands function.  

  To ensure that voice commands are 
always recognised by the system, 
please observe the following 
recommendations: 
   -  

speak in a normal tone without 
breaking up words or raising your 
voice. 
always wait for the "beep" (audible 
signal) before speaking. 
for best operation, it is 
recommended that the windows 
and opening roof be closed to 
avoid extraneous interference 
(according to version). 
before making a voice command, 
ask other passengers to not speak.

      Information - Using the system 

  Press the Push To Talk 
button and tell me what you'd 
like after the tone. Remember 
you can interrupt me at any 

time by pressing this button. If you 
press it again while I'm waiting for you 
to speak, it'll end the conversation. If 
you need to start over, say "cancel". 
If you want to undo something, say 
"undo". And to get information and tips 
at any time, just say "help". If you ask 
to me do something and there's some 
information missing that I need, I'll 
give you some examples or take you 
through it step by step. There's more 
information available in "novice" mode. 
You can set the dialogue mode to 
"expert" when you feel comfortable.   

  Example of a "voice command" for 
navigation: 
"Navigate to address 11 Regent 
Street, London" .  
  Example of a "voice command" for 
the radio and media: 
"Play artist Madonna" .  
  Example of a "voice command" for 
the telephone: 
"Call David Miller" .  

  The voice commands, with a choice 
of 12 languages (English, French, 
Italian, Spanish, German, Dutch, 
Portuguese, Polish, Turkish, Russian, 
Arabic, Brazilian), are made using the 
language previously chosen and set in 
the system.  

  Alternative synonyms can be used for 
some voice commands.

 Frequently asked questions 

   The following table groups together the answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning your audio system.   
  Navigation  
QUESTION

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 The route calculation is not 
successful. 

 The route settings may conflict with the current location (exclusion of 
toll roads on a toll motorway). 

 Check the route settings in the "Navigation" 
menu. 

 The POIs do not appear. 

 The POIs have not been selected. 

 Select the POIs in the list of POIs. 

 The audible warning of 
"Danger areas" does not 
work. 

 The system does not 
suggest a detour around an 
incident on the route. 

 The audible warning is not active. 

 The guidance criteria do not take account of TMC messages. 

 I receive a "Danger area" 
alert which is not on my 
route. 

 Other than guidance, the system announces all "Danger areas" 
positioned in a cone located in front of the vehicle. It may provide an 
alert for "Danger areas" located on nearby or parallel roads. 

 Activate audible warnings (without the possibility 
of adjusting the volume) in the "Navigation" menu. 

 Select setting for the "Traffic info" function in 
the list of route settings (Without, Manual or 
Automatic). 

 Zoom in on the map to view the exact position of the 
"Danger area". Select "On the route" to no longer 
receive alerts other than navigation instructions or 
to reduce the time for the announcement. 

88

 Audio and Telematics 

QUESTION

 Certain traffic jams along 
the route are not indicated 
in real time. 

ANSWER

 On starting, it is several minutes before the system begins to receive 
the traffic information. 

SOLUTION

 Wait until the traffic information is being received 
correctly (display of the traffic information icons 
on the map). 

 In certain countries, only major routes (motorways...) are listed for 
the traffic information. 

 This phenomenon is normal. The system is 
dependent on the traffic information available. 

 The altitude is not 
displayed. 

 On starting, the initialisation of the GPS may take up to 3 minutes to 
receive more than 4 satellites correctly. 

 Wait until the system has started up completely so 
that there is GPS coverage by at least 4 satellites. 

 Depending on the geographical environment (tunnel...) or the 
weather, the conditions of reception of the GPS signal may vary. 

 This phenomenon is normal. The system 
is dependent on the GPS signal reception 
conditions. 

.

89

 Audio and Telematics 

  Radio  

QUESTION

 The quality of reception of 
the radio station listened 
to gradually deteriorates 
or the stored stations do 
not function (no sound, 
87.5 Mhz is displayed...). 

 I cannot find some radio 
stations in the list of 
stations received. 

 The name of the radio 
station changes. 

ANSWER

 The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station 
listened to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area 
through which the vehicle is travelling. 

SOLUTION

 Activate the "RDS" function by means of the 
short-cut menu to enable the system to check 
whether there is a more powerful transmitter in 
the geographical area. 

 The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, basement car parks...) 
block reception, including in RDS mode. 

 This phenomenon is normal and does not indicate 
a fault with the audio system. 

 The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going 
through a car wash or into an underground car park). 

 Have the aerial checked by a franchised dealer. 

 The station is not received or its name has changed in the list. 

 Press on the "Update list" button in the "Radio 
stations" secondary menu. 

 Some radio stations send other information in place of their name 
(the title of the song for example). 
 The system interprets this information as the name of the station.

  Media  

QUESTION
 Playback of my USB 
memory stick starts only 
after a very long wait 
(around 2 to 3 minutes). 

 The CD is ejected 
automatically or is not 
played by the player. 

 There is a long waiting 
period following the 
insertion of a CD or 
connection of a USB 
memory stick. 
 The CD player sound is 
poor. 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 Some files supplied with the memory stick may greatly slow down 
access to reading the memory stick (multiplication by 10 of the 
catalogue time). 

 Delete the files supplied with the memory stick 
and limit the number of sub-folders in the file 
structure on the memory stick. 

 The CD is inserted upside down, is unplayable, does not contain any audio 
data or contains an audio format which the player does not recognise. 

 The CD has been recorded in a format that is not compatible with the player (udf, ...). 

 The CD is protected by an anti-pirating protection system which is 
not recognised by the audio system. 

 When a new medium is inserted, the system reads a certain 
amount of data (directory, title, artist, etc.). This may take from a few 
seconds to a few minutes. 

 Check that the CD is inserted in the player the 
right way up. 
 Check the condition of the CD: the CD cannot be 
played if it is too badly damaged. 
 Check the content in the case of a recorded CD: 
refer to the advice in the "AUDIO" section. 
 The audio system's CD player does not play 
DVDs. 
 Some recorded CDs will not be played by the 
audio system because they are not of adequate 
quality. 

 This phenomenon is normal. 

 The CD used is scratched or of poor quality. 

 Insert good quality CDs and store them in suitable 
conditions. 

 The audio equipment settings (bass, treble, ambiences) are 
unsuitable. 

 Set the treble or bass level to 0, without selecting 
an ambience.

QUESTION

 Some characters in the 
media information are not 
displayed correctly while 
playing. 

 Playing of streaming files 
does not start. 

 The names of tracks and 
the track length are not 
displayed on the screen 
when streaming audio. 

  Telephone  
QUESTION
 I cannot connect my 
Bluetooth telephone. 

 The volume of the 
telephone connected 
in Bluetooth mode is 
inaudible. 

92

 The audio system does not display some types of characters. 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 Use standard characters to name tracks and 
folders. 

 The peripheral device connected does not support automatic play. 

 Start the playback from the device. 

 The Bluetooth profile does not allow the transfer of this information. 

ANSWER

 The telephone's Bluetooth function may be switched off or the 
telephone may not be visible. 

 The Bluetooth telephone is not compatible with the system. 

 The volume depends both on the system and on the telephone. 

SOLUTION

 Check that your telephone's Bluetooth function is 
switched on. 
 Check in the telephone settings that it is "visible 
to all". 

 You can check the compatibility of your telephone 
at the Brand's website (services). 

 Increase the volume of the audio system, to 
maximum if required, and increase the volume of 
the telephone if necessary. 

 The ambient noise level has an influence on the quality of telephone 
communication. 

 Reduce the ambient noise level (close the windows, 
reduce the booster fan speed, slow down, ...). 

QUESTION
 Some contacts are 
duplicated in the list. 

ANSWER

 The options for synchronizing contacts are synchronizing the 
contacts on the SIM card, the contacts on the telephone, or both. 
When both synchronizations are selected, some contacts may be 
duplicated. 

SOLUTION

 Select "Display SIM card contacts" or "Display 
telephone contacts". 

 Contacts are not shown in 
alphabetical order. 

 Some telephones offer display options. Depending on the settings 
chosen, contacts can be transferred in a specific order. 

 Modify the display setting in the telephone 
directory. 

 Audio and Telematics 

 The Bluetooth mode does not permit sending SMS text messages to 
the system. 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 The selection of an equalizer setting imposes the settings for treble 
and bass and vice-versa. 

 Modify the treble and bass or equalizer settings 
to obtain the desired musical ambience. 

 The selection of a distribution setting imposes the balance settings 
and vice-versa. 

 Modify the balance or distribution settings to 
obtain the desired musical ambience. 

 The system does not receive 
SMS text messages.

QUESTION

 In changing the setting 
of treble and bass the 
equalizer setting is

 In changing the equalizer 
setting, treble and bass 
return to zero. 

 When changing the 
balance settings, the 
distribution setting is 
deselected. 

 When changing an 
distribution setting, 
the balance setting is

.

93

 Audio and Telematics 

QUESTION

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 There is a difference in 
sound quality between the 
different audio sources. 

 For optimum sound quality, the audio settings can be adapted to 
the different sound sources, which may result in audible differences 
when changing source. 

 Check that the audio settings are adapted to the 
sources listened to. Adjust Balance, Treble, Bass 
to the middle position, select the "None" musical 
ambience and set the loudness correction to the 
"Active" position in CD mode or to the "Inactive" 
position in radio mode. 

 With the engine off, the 
system switches off after a 
few minutes of use. 

 When the engine is switched off, the system's operating time 
depends on the state of charge of the battery. 
 The switch-off is normal: the system switches to economy mode 
and switches off to prevent discharging of the vehicle's battery. 

 Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery 
charge. 

 The date and time cannot 
be set. 

 Setting of the date and time is only available if the synchronisation 
with the satellites is deactivated.

  Digital radio provides higher quality 
reception. 
 The different multiplexes offer a 
choice of radio stations arranged in 
alphabetical order.  

  "DAB" does not cover 100% of the 
territory. 
 When the digital radio signal is poor, 
the "FM-DAB Follow-up" allows you to 
continue listening to the same station, 
by automatically switching to the 
corresponding "FM" analogue station 
(if there is one).  

  If the "FM-DAB Follow-up" is activated, 
there is a difference of a few seconds 
when the system switches to "FM" 
analogue radio with sometimes a 
variation in volume. 
 Once the digital signal is restored, the 
system automatically changes back to 
"DAB".

 Frequently asked questions 

   The following table groups together the answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning your audio system.   
  Radio  

QUESTION

 The quality of reception of 
the radio station listened 
to gradually deteriorates 
or the stored stations do 
not function (no sound, 
87.5 Mhz is displayed...). 

ANSWER

 The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station 
listened to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area 
through which the vehicle is travelling. 

SOLUTION

 Activate the "RDS" function by means of the 
upper band to enable the system to check 
whether there is a more powerful transmitter in 
the geographical area. 

 The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, basement car parks...) 
block reception, including in RDS mode. 

 This phenomenon is normal and does not indicate 
a fault with the audio system. 

 The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going 
through a car wash or into an underground car park). 

 Have the aerial checked by a franchised dealer. 

 I cannot find some radio 
stations in the list of 
stations received. 

 The name of the radio 
station changes. 

 The station is not received or its name has changed in the list. 

 Press the round arrow on the "List" tab of the 
"Radio" page. 

 Some radio stations send other information in place of their name 
(the title of the song for example). 
 The system interprets this information as the name of the station. 

.

143

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 Some files supplied with the memory stick may greatly slow down 
access to reading the memory stick (multiplication by 10 of the 
catalogue time). 

 Delete the files supplied with the memory stick 
and limit the number of sub-folders in the file 
structure on the memory stick. 

 The audio system does not display some types of characters. 

 Use standard characters to name tracks and 
folders. 

 The peripheral device connected does not support automatic play. 

 Start the playback from the device. 

 The Bluetooth profile does not allow the transfer of this information. 

 Audio and Telematics 

  Media  

QUESTION
 Playback of my USB 
memory stick starts only 
after a very long wait 
(around 2 to 3 minutes). 

 Some characters in the 
media information are not 
displayed correctly while 
playing. 

 Playing of streaming files 
does not start. 

 The names of tracks and 
the track length are not 
displayed on the screen 
when streaming audio.

 Audio and Telematics 

  Telephone  
QUESTION
 I cannot connect my 
Bluetooth telephone. 

ANSWER

 The telephone's Bluetooth function may be switched off or the 
telephone may not be visible. 

 The Bluetooth telephone is not compatible with the system. 

SOLUTION

 Check that your telephone's Bluetooth function is 
switched on. 
 Check in the telephone settings that it is "visible 
to all". 

 You can check the compatibility of your telephone 
at the Brand's website (services). 

 The volume of the 
telephone connected 
in Bluetooth mode is 
inaudible. 

 The volume depends both on the system and on the telephone. 

 Increase the volume of the audio system, to 
maximum if required, and increase the volume of 
the telephone if necessary. 

 The ambient noise level has an influence on the quality of telephone 
communication. 

 Reduce the ambient noise level (close the 
windows, reduce the booster fan speed, slow 
down, ...). 

 Contacts are not shown in 
alphabetical order. 

 Some telephones offer display options. Depending on the settings 
chosen, contacts can be transferred in a specific order. 

 Modify the display setting in the telephone 
directory.

QUESTION

 In changing the setting 
of treble and bass the 
equalizer setting is 
deselected. 

 In changing the equalizer 
setting, treble and bass 
return to zero. 

 When changing the 
balance settings, the 
distribution setting is 
deselected. 

 When changing a 
distribution setting, 
the balance setting is 
deselected. 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 The selection of an equalizer setting imposes the settings for treble 
and bass and vice-versa. 

 Modify the treble and bass or equalizer settings to 
obtain the desired musical ambience. 

 The selection of a distribution setting imposes the balance settings 
and vice-versa. 

 Modify the balance or distribution settings to 
obtain the desired musical ambience. 

 There is a difference in 
sound quality between the 
different audio sources. 

 For optimum sound quality, the audio settings can be adapted to 
the different sound sources, which may result in audible differences 
when changing source. 

 Check that the audio settings are adapted to the 
sources listened to. Adjust the audio functions to 
the middle position. 

 With the engine off, the 
system switches off after a 
few minutes of use. 

 When the engine is switched off, the system's operating time 
depends on the state of charge of the battery. 
 The switch-off is normal: the system switches to economy mode and 
switches off to prevent discharging of the vehicle's battery. 

 Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery 
charge.

  The different functions and adjustments 
described vary according to the version 
and configuration of your vehicle.  

  As a safety measure and because it 
requires the sustained attention of the 
driver, the pairing of your Bluetooth 
telephone to the Bluetooth hands-free 
audio system must only be carried out 
with the  vehicle stationary  and the 
ignition on.  

  Your audio system is coded in such 
a way that it will only operate in your 
vehicle. 
 All work on the system must be 
carried out exclusively by a dealer or 
qualified workshop, to avoid any risk of 
electrocution, fire or mechanical faults.  

  To avoid discharging the battery, the 
audio system may switch off after a few 
minutes if the engine is not running.

 To update this list, press for more 
than two seconds. The sound is cut 
while updating.   

  The external environment (hills, 
buildings, tunnels, basement car 
parks, ...) may block reception, 
including in RDS mode. This is a 
normal effect of the way in which radio 
waves are transmitted and does not 
indicate any failure of the audio system.  

  Short procedure  
  In " Radio " mode, press the  OK  button to 
activate or deactivate RDS directly.  

  Long procedure  

  Press the " MENU " button.  

  If RDS is not available, the RDS symbol 
appears barred in the screen.  

  RDS, if activated, enables you to continue 
listening to the same station by automatic 
retuning to alternative frequencies. 
However, in certain conditions, coverage 
of an RDS station may not be assured 
throughout the country as radio stations 
do not cover 100 % of the territory. This 
explains the loss of reception of a station 
that can occur during a journey.

        Receiving TA messages 

  The TA (Traffic Announcement) 
function gives priority to TA alert 
messages. To operate, this function 
needs good reception of a radio station 
transmitting this type of message. 
When a traffic report is transmitted, the 
current audio source (Radio, CD, ...) 
is interrupted automatically to play the 
TA message. Normal playback of the 
audio source resumes at the end of the 
transmission of the message.  

  Take care when increasing the volume 
while listening to TA messages. The 
volume may prove too high on return to 
the original audio source.  

  Press the TA button to activate or 
deactivate traffic messages.   

      Receiving INFO messages 
 The INFO function gives priority to TA 
traffic announcements. To be active, 
this function needs good reception 
of a radio station that transmits this 
type of message. When a message is 
transmitted, the current audio source 
(Radio, CD, USB, ...) is interrupted 
automatically to receive the INFO 
message. Normal play resumes at the 
end of the message transmission.

 Frequently asked questions 

   The table below gives answers to the most frequently asked questions on your audio system.   

QUESTION

 With the engine off, the 
audio system switches off 
after a few minutes of use. 

ANSWER

 When the engine is switched off, the audio system operating time 
depends on the state of charge of the battery. 
 The switch-off is normal: the audio equipment switches to economy 
mode and switches off to prevent discharging of the vehicle's 
battery. 

 The message "the audio 
system is overheated" 
appears on the display. 

 In order to protect the installation if the surrounding temperature 
is too high, the audio system switches to an automatic thermal 
protection mode leading to a reduction in volume or CD play 
stopping. 

  Radio  

QUESTION

ANSWER

 There is a difference in 
sound quality between the 
different audio sources 
(radio, CD...). 

 For optimum sound quality, the audio settings (Volume, Bass, 
Treble, Ambience and Loudness) can be adapted to the different 
sound sources, which may result in audible differences when 
changing source (radio, CD...). 

SOLUTION

 Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery 
charge. 

 Switch the audio system off for a few minutes to 
allow the system to cool. 

SOLUTION

 Check that the audio settings (Volume, Bass, 
Treble, Ambience and Loudness) are adapted to 
the sources listened to. It is advisable to set the 
audio functions (Bass, Treble, Front-Rear Balance 
and Left-Right Balance) to the middle position, 
select the musical ambience "None" and set the 
loudness correction to the "Active" position in CD 
mode or to the "Inactive" position in radio mode.

QUESTION

 The preset stations do 
not function (no sound, 
87.5 Mhz is displayed...). 

 The traffic announcement 
(TA) is displayed. I do 
not receive any traffic 
information. 

 The quality of reception of 
the radio station listened 
to gradually deteriorates 
or the stored stations do 
not function (no sound, 
87.5 Mhz is displayed...). 

 An incorrect waveband is selected. 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 Press the BAND button to return to the waveband 
(FM, FM2, DAB, AM) on which the stations are 
preset. 

 The radio station is not part of the regional traffic information 
network. 

 Tune to a radio station which broadcasts traffic 
information. 

 The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station 
listened to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area 
through which the vehicle is travelling. 

 Activate the RDS function to enable the system 
to check whether there is a more powerful 
transmitter in the geographical area. 

 The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, underground car parks...) block 
reception, including in RDS mode. 

 This phenomenon is normal and does not indicate 
a fault in the audio system. 

 The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going 
through an automatic car wash or into an underground car park). 

 Have the aerial checked by a franchised dealer. 

 Sound cut-outs of 1 to 
2 seconds in radio mode. 

 During this brief sound cut-out, the RDS searches for another 
frequency giving better reception of the station. 

 Deactivate the RDS function if the phenomenon is 
too frequent and always on the same route.

 The CD is ejected every 
time or is not played. 

 The state of charge of the device may be too low. 

 Charge the battery of the portable device. 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 The USB memory stick is not recognised. 
 The USB memory stick may be corrupt. 

 Reformat the USB memory stick. 

 The CD is upside down, cannot be read, does not contain audio 
files or contains audio files of a format not recognised by the audio 
system. 
 The CD is protected by an anti-pirating system not recognised by 
the audio system. 

   -   Check that the CD is inserted in the player the 

right way up. 

  -   Check the condition of the CD: the CD cannot 

be played if it is too damaged. 

  -   Check the content in the case of a recorded 
CD: consult the advice in the "Audio" section. 

  -   Due to their quality level, certain writeable 
CDs will not be played by the audio system.  

 Insert a good quality CD and store them in 
suitable conditions. 

 Return bass and treble settings to 0, without 
selecting an ambience. 

 The sound from the CD is 
poor. 

 The CD used is scratched or of poor quality. 

 The audio settings (base, treble, ambience) are unsuitable. 

 Depending on the smartphone, access by the audio system to music 
on the smartphone may have to be approved on the latter.
