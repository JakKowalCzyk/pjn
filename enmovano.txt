passenger airbag.

As long as control indicator W is not
illuminated, the airbag systems for
the front passenger seat will inflate in
the event of a collision.
If control indicator A remains
illuminated together with v, this
indicates a fault within the system.
The switch position may have been
changed inadvertently with the
ignition on. Turn ignition off and on
again and reset the switch position. If
A and v still remain illuminated,
seek the assistance of a workshop.
Change status only when the vehicle
is stopped with the ignition off. Status
remains until the next change.

Child restraints
Child restraint systems
We recommend the Opel child
restraint system which is tailored
specifically to the vehicle.
When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.
Always comply with local or national
regulations. In some countries, the
use of child restraint systems is
forbidden on certain seats.

9 Warning

When using a child restraint
system on the front passenger
seat, the airbag systems for the
front passenger seat must be
deactivated; if not, the triggering of
the airbags poses a risk of fatal
injury to the child.
This is especially the case if rear-
facing child restraint systems are
used on the front passenger seat.

Airbag deactivation 3 54.
Airbag label 3 50.
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This makes sure that the
child's backbone, which is still very
weak, is under less strain in the event
of an accident.
Child locks 3 26.
Selecting the right system
Suitable are restraint systems that
comply with valid UN ECE
regulations. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct, see following
tables.

Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.
When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.
Child restraint systems could be
fastened with ISOFIX mounting
brackets, Top-tether if available, and/
or a three-point seat belt. Refer to the
following tables.
Note
Do not affix anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.
A child restraint system which has
been subjected to stress in an
accident must be replaced.

Remote control

When increased ground clearance or
improved vehicle access is required,
the suspension can be raised or
lowered using the remote control.

Caution

Ensure there is adequate
clearance and that there are no
obstructions when adjusting the
suspension height.

The remote control unit is magnetic
and may be fixed to any metal part of
the vehicle or stored in its holder.

With the engine running, press the
appropriate button for 2 seconds to
adjust the suspension height.
Indicator light will flash intermittently
while height adjustment is in progress
and illuminates when complete.
If the ignition is switched on with
engine not running, the suspension
height can only be lowered.
Note
Handle with care, protect from
moisture and high temperatures and
avoid unnecessary operation.
Pre-programmed settings
Adjusts the suspension height to one
of three pre-programmed positions.
l : lowered position
k : normal position
j : raised position

Caution

If an obstacle is detected while
raising or lowering, the
suspension height is returned to
the normal position after a delay.
This does not guarantee damage-

free operation. Ensuring sufficient
clearance and freedom from
obstacles is the responsibility of
the driver.

Manual settings
Manual adjustment can only be
performed when the vehicle is
stationary.
Select by pressing h for 2 seconds,
then R to raise, or S to lower.
To exit, press any of the pre-
programmed buttons.
Note
Obstacle detection is not available
during manual adjustment.
When a certain low speed is
exceeded or when the ignition is
switched off, height adjustment is
deactivated automatically and the
suspension height is returned to the
normal position.
Service mode
When the vehicle is stationary, press
i for 5 seconds to put the vehicle into
service mode. The indicator light will
illuminate.

When service mode has been
activated, the air suspension master
switch must be turned off.

Fault
If a fault is detected, i will flash
intermittently. If service mode has
been activated and there is a fault, h,
S and R will flash simultaneously.
Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving without
any notification.
The filter is cleaned by periodically
burning off the soot particles at high
temperature. This process takes
place automatically under set driving

125
Driving and operating
conditions. Autostop is not available
and fuel consumption may be higher
during this period. The emission of
smells and smoke during this process
is normal.
Under certain driving conditions, e.g.
short distances, the system cannot
clean itself automatically.
If cleaning of the filter is required and
if previous driving conditions did not
enable automatic cleaning, it will be
indicated by illumination of control
indicator A 3 86. Seek the
assistance of a workshop
immediately.

Caution

If the cleaning process is
interrupted, there is a risk of
provoking severe engine damage.

Cleaning takes place quickest at high
engine speeds and loads.

Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the
amount of harmful substances in the
exhaust gases.

126

Driving and operating

Caution

Fuel grades other than those listed
on page 3 149, 3 203 could
damage the catalytic converter or
electronic components.
Unburnt petrol will overheat and
damage the catalytic converter.
Therefore avoid excessive use of
the starter, running the fuel tank
dry and starting the engine by
pushing or towing.

In the event of misfiring, uneven
engine running, a reduction in engine
performance or other unusual
problems, have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop as soon as
possible. In an emergency, driving
can be continued for a short period,
keeping vehicle speed and engine
speed low.
If control indicator Z flashes, the
permitted emission limits may be
exceeded. Lift your foot off the
accelerator until Z stops flashing and
is steadily illuminated. Contact a
workshop immediately.

Malfunction indicator light 3 85.

AdBlue
General information
The selective catalytic reduction
(BlueInjection) is a method to
substantially reduce the nitrogen
oxides in the exhaust emission. This
is achieved by injecting a Diesel
Exhaust Fluid (DEF) into the exhaust
system.
The designation of the DEF used is
AdBlue Ⓡ. It is a non-toxic, non-
flammable, colourless and odourless
fluid which consists of 32% urea and
68% water.
Note
AdBlue Ⓡ is a registered trademark
of the Verband der
Automobilindustrie e.V. (VDA).

9 Warning

Avoid contact of your eyes or skin
with AdBlue.
In case of eye or skin contact,
rinse off with water.

Caution

Avoid contact of the paintwork with
AdBlue.
In case of contact, rinse off with
water.

AdBlue freezes at a temperature of
approx. -11 °C. As the vehicle is
equipped with an AdBlue pre-heater,
the emissions reduction at low
temperatures is ensured. The AdBlue
pre-heater works automatically.

Adblue gauge

The current fluid level remaining is
shown in the Adblue gauge 3 80.
Level warnings
The AdBlue consumption is approx.
3.5 litres per 1000 km and depends

Refilling AdBlue

Caution

Only use AdBlue that complies
with European standards
DIN 70 070 and ISO 22241-1.
Do not use additives.
Do not dilute AdBlue.
Otherwise the selective catalytic
reduction system could be
damaged.

Note
If AdBlue must be refilled at very low
temperatures, the refilling of AdBlue
may not be detected by the system.
In this case, park the vehicle in a

space with a higher ambient
temperature until AdBlue is
liquefied.
Note
If engine starting is prohibited due to
low Adblue level, we recommend
adding a volume of at least 10 litres
of AdBlue when refilling. Avoid minor
top-ups (e.g. less than 5 litres),
otherwise the system may not detect
a refill.
Note
When unscrewing the protective cap
from the filler neck, ammonia fumes
may emerge. Do not inhale as the
fumes have a pungent smell. The
fumes are not harmful by inhalation.
The vehicle must be parked on a level
surface.
The filler neck for AdBlue is located
behind the filler flap located on the
right-hand side of the vehicle.
The filler flap can only be opened if
the vehicle is unlocked and the right-

135
Driving and operating
ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
Control indicator u 3 87.
Fault
If control indicators u and A
illuminate with the messages CHECK
ABS and CHECK ESP in the Driver
Information Centre (DIC), there is a
fault in the ABS. The brake system
remains operational but without ABS
regulation.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when you depress the
brake pedal firmly. You need to use
considerably more force for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing your journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.

Driving and operating
Parking assist
The parking assist makes reverse
parking easier by measuring the
distance between the rear of the
vehicle and obstacles. It is the driver,
however, who bears full responsibility
for the parking manoeuvre.

The system consists of four ultrasonic
parking sensors in the rear bumper.
Note
Attached parts in the detection area
cause system malfunction.

Driving and operating

144
Activation
When reverse gear is engaged, the
system switches itself on
automatically. Readiness for
operation is indicated by a brief
acoustic alarm.
An obstacle is indicated by buzzers.
The interval between the buzzers
becomes shorter as the vehicle gets
closer to the obstacle. When the
distance is less than 30 cm, the
buzzer is continuous.

9 Warning

Under certain circumstances,
various reflective surfaces on
objects or clothing as well as
external noise sources may cause
the system to fail to detect
obstacles.
Special attention must be paid to
low obstacles which can damage
the lower part of the bumper.

Caution

Deactivation

Performance of the sensor can be
reduced when sensors are
covered, e.g. by ice or snow.
Performance of the parking assist
system can be reduced due to
heavy loading.

Fuel consumption - CO2-
Emissions
For the values specific to your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.

General information
The official fuel consumption and
specific CO2 emission figures quoted
relate to the EU base model with
standard equipment.
Fuel consumption data and CO2
emission data are determined
according to regulation
715/2007 692/2008 A, taking into
consideration the vehicle weight in
running order, as specified by the
regulation.
The figures must not be taken as a
guarantee for the actual fuel
consumption of a particular vehicle.
Additional equipment may result in
slightly higher results than the stated
consumption and CO2 figures.
Furthermore, fuel consumption is
dependent on personal driving style
as well as road and traffic conditions.

Trailer hitch
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust fitting of towing equipment at
a later date to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
In the case of trailers with brakes,
attach the breakaway stopping cable.
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements. For trailers with
low driving stability the use of a
stabiliser is recommended.
A maximum speed of 80 km/h must
not be exceeded, even in countries
where higher speeds are permitted.

151
Driving and operating
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 221.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle-dependent and engine-
dependent maximum values which
must not be exceeded. The actual
trailer load is the difference between
the actual gross weight of the trailer
and the actual coupling socket load
with the trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12%.
The permitted trailer load applies up
to the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea

The pitch of the audible warning will
change if a turn signal light on the
trailer or the towing vehicle fails.

Trailer stability assist
If the system detects snaking
movements, engine power is reduced
and the vehicle/trailer combination is
selectively braked until the snaking
ceases. While the system is working,
keep steering wheel as still as
possible.
Trailer stability assist (TSA) is a
function of the Electronic Stability
Program (ESP) 3 138.

Driving and operating
152
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10%
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8%, e.g. motorways).
The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 201.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load is specified on the
towing equipment identification plate
and in the vehicle documents. Always
aim for the maximum load, especially
in the case of heavy trailers. The
vertical coupling load should never
fall below 25 kg.

In the case of trailer loads of
1200 kg or more, the vertical coupling
load should not be less than 50 kg.
Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded (including
all occupants), the permissible rear
axle load (see identification plate or
vehicle documents) must not be
exceeded.

Towing equipment
Caution

When operating without a trailer,
remove the coupling ball bar.

Towing equipment audible
warning
For vehicles fitted with towing
equipment, when connected to a
trailer the pitch of the audible warning
changes upon operation of the turn
signals.

Wheels and tyres

Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.
We recommend not swapping the
front wheels with the rear wheels and
vice versa, as this can affect vehicle
stability. Always use less worn tyres
on the rear axle.

Tyres
Factory-fitted tyres are matched to
the chassis and offer optimum driving
comfort and safety.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the maximum speed
sticker in the driver's field of view.

Tyre designations
E.g. 215/65 R 16 C 109 R
215 : tyre width, mm
65 : cross-section ratio (tyre height

to tyre width), %
R : belt type: Radial
RF : type: RunFlat
16 : wheel diameter, inches
C : cargo or commercial use
88 : load index e.g. 109 is

equivalent to approx. 1030 kg

R : speed code letter
Speed code letter:
Q : up to 160 km/h
S : up to 180 km/h
T : up to 190 km/h
H : up to 210 km/h
V : up to 240 km/h
W : up to 270 km/h

Directional tyres
Fit directional tyres such that they roll
in the direction of travel. The rolling
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel. This also applies to vehicles
with tyre pressure monitoring system.
The tyre pressure information label
on the driver's door frame indicates
the original equipment tyres and the
correspondent tyre pressures.
Always inflate tyres to the pressures
shown on the label.
Tyre pressures 3 221.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.

Vehicle care

177

Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.
Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options. For the correct tyre
pressure value, follow the procedure
below:
1. Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 203.

2. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 221.
For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

Vehicle care

178
Rear-wheel drive, with twin rear
wheels
When inflating the outer tyre, the
inflation tube should be passed

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The Tyre Pressure Monitoring
System (TPMS) uses radio and
sensor technology to check tyre
pressure levels.

Caution

Tyre pressure monitoring system
warns only about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.

With the vehicle stationary, press
button on end of wiper lever
repeatedly until the tyre pressure
menu is displayed.
Low tyre pressure condition

Note
In countries where the tyre pressure
monitoring system is legally
required, the use of wheels without
pressure sensors will invalidate the
vehicle type approval.
The TPMS sensors monitor the air
pressure in the tyres and transmit tyre
pressure readings to a receiver
located in the vehicle.
Tyre pressure chart 3 221.
Tyre pressures in display
The current tyre pressures can be
shown in the Driver Information
Centre (DIC) 3 90.

A detected low tyre pressure
condition is indicated by illumination
of control indicator w 3 88 and a
corresponding message appears in
the DIC.
If w illuminates, stop as soon as
possible and inflate the tyres as
recommended 3 221.

After inflating, some driving may be
required to update the tyre pressure
values in the DIC. During this time w
may illuminate.
If w illuminates at lower temperatures
and extinguishes after some driving,
this could be an indicator for
approaching a low tyre pressure
condition. Check tyre pressure of all
four tyres.
If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition.
Only mount wheels with pressure
sensors, otherwise the tyre pressure
will not be displayed and w flashes for
several seconds then illuminates
continuously together with control
indicator A 3 86 and a

General information
The use of tyre chains or
commercially available liquid tyre
repair kits can impair the function of
the system. Factory-approved tyre
repair kits can be used.
Tyre repair kit 3 181, Tyre chains
3 181.
External high-power radio equipment
could disrupt the TPMS.
Each time the tyres are replaced,
TPMS sensors must be dismounted
and serviced by a workshop.

Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.
Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons it is recommended
that the tread depth of the tyres on
one axle should not vary by more than
2 mm.

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear

indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every 6 years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and make other vehicle
modifications.
After converting to a different tyre
size, have the label with tyre
pressures replaced.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheels
may lead to accidents and will
invalidate the vehicle type
approval.

Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.

Vehicle care

181

Wheel covers on steel wheels may
come into contact with parts of the
chains. In such cases, remove the
wheel covers.
Tyre chains may only be used at
speeds up to 50 km/h and, when
travelling on roads that are free of
snow, they may only be used for brief
periods since they are subject to rapid
wear on a hard road and may snap.
The use of tyre chains is not permitted
on the temporary spare wheel.

Tyre repair kit
Minor damage to the tyre tread can be
repaired with the tyre repair kit.
Do not remove foreign bodies from
the tyres.
Tyre damage exceeding 4 mm or that
is at the tyre's sidewall near the rim
cannot be repaired with the tyre repair

11. Have the new wheel balanced on

the vehicle. Check the tyre
pressure of the installed tyre
3 221 and also the wheel bolt/nut
torque as soon as possible.

Have the defective tyre renewed or
repaired.

Spare wheel
Some vehicles are equipped with a
tyre repair kit instead of a spare wheel
3 181.
If mounting a spare wheel which is
different from the other wheels, this
wheel might be classified as a
temporary spare wheel and the
corresponding speed limits apply,
even though no label indicates this.
Seek the assistance of a workshop to
check the applicable speed limit.

Caution

The use of a spare wheel that is
smaller than the other wheels or in
combination with winter tyres
could affect driveability. Have the
defective tyre replaced as soon as
possible.

The spare wheel is held under the
vehicle frame using a winch and
secured by tightening a cable using
the wheel wrench and adapters
(depending on vehicle).
It may be necessary to jack the
vehicle up to gain access to the spare
wheel on a fully loaded vehicle with a
flat rear tyre.

Vehicle care

187

Place wheel upright, unclip retainer
from wheel rim and release the wheel
from the cable and connected
retainer by routing these components
through the centre of the wheel.
Twin rear wheel vehicles have an
additional mounting plate attached to
the spare wheel. Before using the
wheel, undo the nut and remove the
mounting plate.

To release the spare wheel, loosen
cable by connecting the wheel
wrench and adapters (depending on
vehicle) to the slot position illustrated
and lower the wheel fully by turning
wrench clockwise.

Caution

Only use the wheel wrench and
adapters (depending on vehicle)
to lower the spare wheel.
The use of pneumatic tools is
prohibited. This may result in
damage to the winch cable and
equipment.

188

Vehicle care

When reinstalling a spare wheel, first
attach the mounting plate (twin rear
wheel vehicles) and secure with the
nut.
Place wheel upright, then route the
cable and connected retainer from
the front of the wheel (side with tyre
valve) and through the centre of the
wheel. Attach the retainer and clip it
into place, ensuring it is correctly
positioned and that the front of the
wheel (side with tyre valve) will be
facing upwards when reinstalled.
Place wheel below the vehicle frame,
directly beneath the winch
mechanism, then tighten cable using
the wheel wrench and adapters by

If your vehicle gets a flat tyre on the
rear while towing another vehicle,
mount the temporary spare wheel in
the front and the full tyre in the rear.
Tyre chains 3 181.
Summer and winter tyres
If you use winter tyres, the spare
wheel may still be fitted with a
summer tyre.
If you use the spare wheel when it is
fitted with a summer tyre the vehicle's
driveability may be affected,
especially on slippery road surfaces.
Directional tyres
Fit directional tyres such that they roll
in the direction of travel. The rolling
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

connecting to the slot position
illustrated above and turning wrench
anticlockwise until the wheel is
secured in the fully raised position.

9 Warning

Ensure the front of the wheel (side
with tyre valve) is facing upwards
when the spare wheel is
reinstalled below the vehicle
frame.

Temporary spare wheel

Caution

The use of a spare wheel that is
smaller than the other wheels or in
combination with winter tyres
could affect driveability. Have the
defective tyre replaced as soon as
possible.

Only mount one temporary spare
wheel. Do not drive faster than
80 km/h. Take curves slowly. Do not
use for a long period of time.

The following applies to tyres fitted
opposing the rolling direction:
● Driveability may be affected.

Have the defective tyre renewed
or repaired as soon as possible.
● Do not drive faster than 80 km/h.
● Drive particularly carefully on wet

and snow-covered road
surfaces.

Jump starting
Do not start with a quick charger.
A vehicle with a discharged battery
can be started using jump leads and
the battery of another vehicle.

9 Warning

Be extremely careful when starting
with jump leads. Any deviation
from the following instructions can
lead to injuries or damage caused
by battery explosion or damage to
the electrical systems of both
vehicles.

9 Warning

Avoid contact with eyes, skin,
fabrics, and painted surfaces. The
fluid contains sulphuric acid which
can cause injuries and damage in
the event of direct contact.

Vehicle care

189

Caution

The air suspension system must
be switched off prior to jump
starting.

9 Warning

Avoid contact of the battery with
eyes, skin, fabrics and painted
surfaces. The fluid contains
sulphuric acid which can cause
injuries and damage in the event
of direct contact.

● Never expose the vehicle battery

to naked flames or sparks.

● A discharged vehicle battery can
already freeze at a temperature
of 0 °C. Defrost the frozen vehicle
battery before connecting jump
leads.

● Wear eye protection and
protective clothing when
handling a vehicle battery.

Vehicle care

190
● Use a booster battery with the

same voltage (12 volts). Its
capacity (Ah) must not be much
less than that of the discharged
vehicle battery.

● The vehicles must not come into

contact with each other during
the jump starting process.

● Apply the parking brake and

engage neutral (manual
transmission) or N (manual
transmission automated).

In the event of a discharged vehicle
battery, the jump start terminal
enables the vehicle to be started
without the need to access the battery
inside the vehicle.
The jump start terminal is located in
the engine compartment and
identified by a "<" sign on the red
insulating cover. Lift the red insulating
cover to access the terminal
connector.
Ensure the red insulating cover is
latched back into position when not in
use.

Depending on model, the jump start
terminal may be located at the left-

compartment.

far away from the discharged
vehicle battery as possible,
however at least 60 cm.

Route the leads so that they cannot
catch on rotating parts in the engine
compartment.
To start the engine:
1. Start the engine of the vehicle

providing the jump start.

2. After 5 minutes, start the other

engine. Start attempts should be
made for no longer than
15 seconds at an interval of
1 minute.

3. Allow both engines to idle for

approx. 3 minutes with the leads
connected.

4. Switch on electrical consumers

(e.g. headlights, heated rear
window) of the vehicle receiving
the jump start.

5. Reverse above sequence exactly

when removing leads.

Caution

Caution

Towing another vehicle

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

When the engine is not running,
considerably more force is needed to
brake and steer.
To prevent the entry of exhaust fumes
from the towing vehicle, switch on the
air recirculation system 3 105 and
close the windows.
Seek the assistance of a workshop.
After towing, unscrew the towing eye
and refit the cover.

Do not tow the vehicle from the
rear. The front towing eye must
only be used for towing and not
recovering a vehicle.

Switch on ignition to permit operation
of brake lights, horn and windscreen
wipers, and move the steering wheel
slightly to release the steering wheel
lock.
Switch off the air suspension system
3 123.
Transmission in neutral.

Caution

Vehicles with manual
transmission automated: If neutral
cannot be selected, the vehicle
must only be towed with the drive
wheels raised off the ground.
The vehicle should always be
towed with the ignition switched
off.
Manual transmission automated
3 131.

Attach a tow rope - or better still a tow
rod - to the rear towing eye, never to
the rear axle and suspension units.
The rear towing eye must only be
used for towing and not recovering a
vehicle.

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use de-icing agent only when
absolutely necessary, as this has a
degreasing effect and impairs lock
function. After using a de-icing agent,
have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select a programme that
includes waxing. Restrictions for
filmed or matt painted body parts or
decor tapes, see "Polishing and
waxing".
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.

If using a vehicle wash, comply with
the vehicle wash manufacturer's
instructions. The windscreen wipers
must be switched off and the exterior
mirrors must be folded in. Remove
antenna and external accessories
such as roof racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.
Clean bright metal mouldings with a
cleaning solution approved for
aluminium to avoid damages.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of 4 to 9.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.

Vehicle care

193
Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.

Vehicle care

194
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Unpainted plastic body parts must not
be treated with wax or polishing
agents.
Matt filmed body parts or decor tapes
must not be polished, to avoid
gleaming. Do not use hot wax
programmes in automatic car washes
if the vehicle is equipped with these
parts.
Matt painted decor parts, e.g. mirror
housing cover, must not be polished.
Otherwise these parts would become
agleam or the colour would be
dissolved.
Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.

For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Remove dirt residues from smearing
wiper blades by using a soft cloth and
window cleaner. Also make sure to
remove any residues such as wax,
insect residues and similar from the
window.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.

Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Vehicle care

195

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, like zips or
belts or studded jeans.

Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.
Clean leather upholstery with clear
water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument cluster and the
displays should only be cleaned using
a soft damp cloth. If necessary use a
weak soap solution.
Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-
coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil

aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
diesel engines. If it is unavailable,
engine oils of other listed qualities
must be used.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 202.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 202.

Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 202.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only silicate-free long life coolant
(LLC) antifreeze approved for the
vehicle. Consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C.

Service and maintenance

199

This concentration should be
maintained all year round. The use of
additional coolant additives that
intend to give additional corrosion
protection or seal against minor leaks
can cause function problems. Liability
for consequences resulting from the
use of additional coolant additives will
be rejected.
Brake fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.
AdBlue
Only use AdBlue to reduce the
nitrogen oxides in the exhaust
emission 3 126.

Customer information
Declaration of conformity
This vehicle has systems that
transmit and/or receive radio waves
subject to Directive 1999/5/EC.
These systems are in compliance
with the essential requirements and
other relevant provisions of
Directive 1999/5/EC. Copies of the
original Declarations of Conformity
can be obtained on our website.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
● Operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels).
● Status messages of the vehicle
and its single components (e.g.
number of wheel revolutions /
rotational speed, deceleration,
lateral acceleration).

● Dysfunctions and defects in

important system components.

Customer information

224
● Vehicle reactions in particular

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the
stability regulation system).

● Environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature).

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimizing vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
