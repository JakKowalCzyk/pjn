Beyond the warning required by
ECE R94.02, for safety reasons a
forward-facing child restraint system
must only be used subject to the
instructions and restrictions in the
table 3 49.
The airbag label is located on both
sides of the front passenger sun visor.
Airbag deactivation 3 46.

Front airbag system
The front airbag system consists of
one airbag in the steering wheel and
one in the instrument panel on the
front passenger side. The location is
identified by the word AIRBAG.
The front airbag system is triggered in
the event of a front-end impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and head of
the front seat occupants
considerably.

9 Warning

Optimum protection is only
provided when the seat is in the
proper position.
Seat position 3 35.
Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Fit the seat belt correctly and
engage securely. Only then is the
airbag able to protect.
Side airbag system

Seats, restraints

45

Curtain airbag system
The curtain airbag system consists of
an airbag in the roof frame on each
side. The location is identified by the
word AIRBAG on the roof pillars.
The curtain airbag system is triggered
in the event of a side-on impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The side airbag system consists of an
airbag in each front seat backrest.
The location is identified by the word
AIRBAG.
The side airbag system is triggered in
the event of a side impact of a certain
severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and pelvis in
the event of a side-on collision
considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Note
Only use protective seat covers that
have been approved for the vehicle.
Be careful not to cover the airbags.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the head in the event of a
side-on impact considerably.

46

Seats, restraints

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
The hooks on the handles in the
roof frame are only suitable for
hanging up light articles of
clothing, without coat hangers. Do
not keep any items in these
clothes.
Airbag deactivation
The front passenger airbag system
must be deactivated for child restraint
system on the passenger seat
according to the instructions in the
table 3 49. The side airbag and
curtain airbag systems, the belt
pretensioners and all driver airbag
systems will remain active.

Use the ignition key to choose the
switch position:
*OFF : front passenger airbag is
deactivated and will not
inflate in the event of a
collision. Control indicator
*OFF illuminates
continuously in the centre
console

VON : front passenger airbag is

active

9 Danger

Deactivate passenger airbag only
in combination with the use of a
child restraint system, subject to
the instructions and restrictions in
the table 3 49.
Otherwise, there is a risk of fatal
injury for a person occupying a
seat with a deactivated front
passenger airbag.

If the control indicator V illuminates
for approx. 60 seconds after the
ignition is switched on, the front
passenger airbag system will inflate
in the event of a collision.
If both control indicators are
illuminated at the same time, there is
a system failure. The status of the
system is not discernible, therefore
no person is allowed to occupy the
front passenger seat. Contact a
workshop immediately.
Change status only when the vehicle
is stopped with the ignition off.
Status remains until the next change.
Control indicator for airbag
deactivation 3 86.

Child restraints
Child restraint systems
We recommend the following Opel
child restraint systems which are
tailored specifically to the vehicle:
● Group 0, Group 0+

OPEL Baby cradle, with or
without ISOFIX base, for children
up to 13 kg.

● Group I

FAIR G 0/1 S ISOFIX, for children
from 9 kg to 13 kg in this group.
OPEL Duo, for children from
13 kg to 18 kg in this group.

● Group II, Group III

OPEL Kid, OPEL Kidfix, TAKATA
MAXI 2/3 for children from 15 kg
up to 36 kg.

When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.

Seats, restraints

47
Always comply with local or national
regulations. In some countries, the
use of child restraint systems is
forbidden on certain seats.

9 Danger

If using a rear-facing child restraint
system on the front passenger
seat, the airbag system for the
front passenger seat must be
deactivated. This also applies to
certain forward-facing child
restraint systems as indicated in
the table 3 49.

Airbag deactivation 3 46.
Airbag label 3 41.
Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This ensures that the child's
backbone, which is still very weak, is
under less strain in the event of an
accident.

Seats, restraints

48
Suitable are restraint systems that
comply with valid UN ECE
regulations. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct, see following
tables.
Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.
When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.
Note
Do not affix anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.
A child restraint system which has
been subjected to stress in an
accident must be replaced.

Stop-start system
The stop-start system helps to save
fuel and to reduce the exhaust
emissions. When conditions allow, it
switches off the engine as soon as the
vehicle is at a low speed or at a
standstill, e.g. at a traffic light or in a
traffic jam.
On vehicles with manual
transmission, the engine is started
automatically as soon as the clutch is
depressed.
On vehicles with manual transmission
automated, the engine is started
automatically as soon as the brake
pedal is released.
A vehicle battery sensor ensures that
an Autostop is only performed if the
vehicle battery is sufficiently charged
for a restart.

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the
amount of harmful substances in the
exhaust gases.

136
Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing the journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
Control indicator R 3 87.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.

Fault

9 Warning

If there is a fault in the ABS, the
wheels may be liable to lock due
to braking that is heavier than
normal. The advantages of ABS
are no longer available. During
hard braking, the vehicle can no
longer be steered and may
swerve.

Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting off the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.
Control indicator u 3 88.
Adaptive brake light
During full braking, all three brake
lights flash for the duration of ABS

Basic notes on parking assist
systems

9 Warning

Under certain circumstances,
various reflective surfaces on
objects or clothing as well as
external noise sources may cause
the system to fail to detect
obstacles.
Special attention must be paid to
low obstacles which can damage
the lower part of the bumper.

Caution

Performance of the system can be
reduced when sensors are
covered, e.g. by ice or snow.
Performance of the parking assist
system can be reduced due to
heavy loading.
Special conditions apply if there
are taller vehicles in the vicinity
(e.g. off-road vehicles, mini vans,
vans). Object identification and

correct distance indication in the
upper part of these vehicles
cannot be guaranteed.
Objects with a very small reflection
cross-section, e.g. objects of
narrow size or soft materials, may
not be detected by the system.
Parking assist systems do not
detect objects outside the
detection range.

Note
It is possible that the sensor detects
a non-existing object caused by
echo disturbance from external
acoustic noise or mechanical
misalignments (sporadic false
warnings may occur).
Make sure that the front number
plate is properly mounted (not bent
and no gaps to the bumper on the left
or right side) and the sensors are
firmly in place.
Advanced parking assist system
may not respond to changes in the
available parking space after
initiating a parking manoeuvre. The
system may recognize an entry, a

gateway, a courtyard or even a
crossing as a parking slot. After
selecting reverse gear the system
will start a parking manoeuvre. Take
care regarding the availability of the
suggested parking slot.
Surface irregularities, e.g. on
construction zones, are not detected
by the system. The driver accepts
responsibility.
Note
If engaging a forward gear and
exceeding a certain speed, the rear
parking assist will be deactivated
when the rear carrier system is
extended.
If engaging reverse at first, the
parking assist will detect the rear
carrier system and provide a buzzing
sound. Press r or D briefly to
deactivate the parking assist.
Note
After production, the system
requires a calibration. For optimal
parking guidance, a driving distance
of at least 10 km, including a number
of bends, is required.

Driving and operating
Side blind spot alert
The Side blind spot alert system
detects and reports objects on either
side of the vehicle, within a specified
"blind spot" zone. The system alerts
visually in each exterior mirror, when
detecting objects that may not be
visible in the interior and exterior
mirrors.
Side blind spot alert uses some of the
advanced parking assist sensors
which are located in the front and rear
bumper on both sides of the vehicle.

9 Warning

Side blind spot alert does not
replace driver vision.
The system does not detect:
● Vehicles outside the side blind

zones which may be rapidly
approaching.

● Pedestrians, cyclists or

animals.

Before changing a lane, always
check all mirrors, look over the
shoulder and use the turn signal.

Driving and operating
154
When the system detects a vehicle in
the side blind zone while driving
forwards, either while passing a
vehicle or being passed, a yellow
warning symbol B will illuminate in
the relevant exterior mirror. If the
driver then activates the turn signal,
the warning symbol B starts flashing
yellow as a warning not to change
lanes.
Note
If the passing vehicle is at least
10 km/h faster than the passed
vehicle, the warning symbol B in the
relevant exterior mirror may not
illuminate.

Side blind spot alert is designed to
ignore stationary objects, e.g.
guardrails, posts, curbs, walls and
beams. Parked vehicles or oncoming
vehicles are not detected.
Fault
Occasional missed alerts can occur
under normal circumstances and will
increase in wet conditions.
Side blind spot alert does not operate
when the left or right corners of the
rear bumper are covered with mud,
dirt, snow, ice, slush, or in heavy
rainstorms. Cleaning instructions
3 207.
In the event of a fault in the system or
if the system does not work due to
temporary conditions, a message is
displayed in the Driver Information
Centre. Seek the assistance of a
workshop.

Side blind spot alert is active from
speeds of 10 km/h up to 140 km/h.
Driving faster than 140 km/h
deactivates the system, indicated by
low lighting warning symbols B in
both exterior mirrors. Reducing the
speed again will extinguish the
warning symbols. If a vehicle is then
detected in the blind zone, the
warning symbols B will illuminate as
normal on the relevant side.
When the vehicle is started, both
exterior mirror displays will briefly
come on to indicate that the system is
operating.
The system can be activated or
deactivated in the Info-Display,
vehicle personalisation 3 100.
Deactivation is indicated by a
message in the Driver Information
Centre.
Detection zones
The detection zones start at the rear
bumper and extend approx. three
metres rearwards and to the sides.
The height of the zone is between
approx. 0.5 metres and two metres off
the ground.

Driving and operating
The boiling point depends on the
pressure and mixing ratio. At ambient
pressure, it is between -42 °C (pure
propane) and -0.5 °C (pure butane).

Caution

The system works at an ambient
temperature of approx. -8 °C to
100 °C.

Full function of the LPG system can
only be guaranteed with liquid gas
which complies with the minimum
requirements of DIN EN 589.
Fuel selector

Fuel
Fuel for petrol engines
Only use unleaded fuel that complies
with European standard EN 228 or
E DIN 51626-1 or equivalent.
The engine is capable of running with
fuel that contains up to 10% ethanol
(e.g. named E10).
Use fuel with the recommended
octane rating. The engine specific
requirements are given in the engine
data overview 3 219. A country
specific label at the fuel filler flap can
supersede the requirement.

Caution

Do not use fuel or fuel additives
that contain metallic compounds
such as manganese-based
additives. This may cause engine
damage.

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 228 or E DIN 51626-1 or
equivalent can lead to deposits or
engine damage.

Caution

Use of fuel with too low an octane
rating could lead to uncontrolled
combustion and engine damage.
Fuel for liquid gas operation
Liquid gas is known as LPG
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas) or under
its French name GPL (Gaz de Pétrole
Liquéfié). LPG is also known as
Autogas.
LPG consists mainly of propane and
butane. The octane rating is between
105 and 115, depending on the
butane proportion. LPG is stored
liquid at around five to ten bar
pressure.

Driving and operating

156
Pressing LPG switches between
petrol and liquid gas operation as
soon as the required parameters
(coolant temperature, gas
temperature and minimum engine
speed) have been reached. The
requirements are usually fulfilled after
approx. 60 seconds (depending on
exterior temperature) and the first firm
press on the accelerator. The LED

The selected fuel mode is stored and
reactivated at the next ignition cycle if
conditions allow.
As soon as the liquid gas tanks are
empty, petrol operation is
automatically engaged until the
ignition is switched off.
When switching automatically
between petrol or gas operation, a
brief delay of engine tractive power
may be noticeable.
Every six months, run the petrol tank
down until control indicator Y
illuminates, then refuel. This helps
maintain fuel quality and system
function for petrol operation.
Fill the tank completely at regular
intervals to prevent corrosion in the
tank.
Faults and remedies
If gas mode is not possible, check the
following:
● Is there enough liquid gas

present?

● Is there enough petrol present for

starting?

Due to extreme temperatures in
combination with the gas
composition, it may take slightly
longer before the system switches
from petrol to gas mode.
In extreme situations, the system may
also switch back to petrol mode if the
minimum requirements are not
fulfilled. If conditions allow, it might be
possible to manually switch back to
liquid gas operation.
Seek the assistance of a workshop in
the event of all other faults.

Caution

Repairs and adjustments may only
be made by trained specialists in
order to maintain the safety and
warranty on the LPG system.

Liquid gas is given a particular odour
(odorised) so that any leaks can be
detected easily.

Wheels and tyres

185

Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.
We recommend not swapping the
front wheels with the rear wheels and
vice versa, as this can affect vehicle
stability. Always use less worn tyres
on the rear axle.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
All tyre sizes are permitted as winter
tyres 3 225.
Tyre size 185/60 R 15 is only
permitted as winter tyre.

Vehicle care

186
In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the speed sticker in
the driver's field of view.

Tyre designations
E.g. 195/55 R 16 95 H
195 : tyre width, mm
55 : cross-section ratio (tyre height

to tyre width), %
R : belt type: Radial
RF : type: RunFlat
16 : wheel diameter, inches
95 : load index e.g. 95 is equivalent

to 690 kg

H : speed code letter
Speed code letter:
Q : up to 160 km/h
S : up to 180 km/h
T : up to 190 km/h
H : up to 210 km/h
V : up to 240 km/h
W : up to 270 km/h
Choose a tyre appropriate for the
maximum speed of your vehicle.

The maximum speed is achievable at
kerb weight with driver (75 kg) plus
125 kg payload. Optional equipment
could reduce the maximum speed of
the vehicle.
Performance 3 221.
Directional tyres
Directional tyres must be mounted so
that they rotate in the correct
direction. The proper rotation
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel.
This also applies to vehicles with tyre
pressure monitoring system.
Unscrew the valve cap.

Tyre pressure 3 225.
The tyre pressure information label
on the right door frame indicates the
original equipment tyres and the
correspondent tyre pressures.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.

The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 225.
Identify the respective tyre.
For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

9 Warning

For specific tyres the
recommended tyre pressure as
shown in the tyre pressure table
may exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.
Never exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.

If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition. After
adjusting tyre pressure switch on
ignition and select the relevant setting
on the page Tyre load in the Driver
Information Centre 3 90.
Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase. Tyre pressure
values provided on the tyre
information label and tyre pressure
chart are valid for cold tyres, which
means at 20 °C.
The pressure increases by nearly
10 kPa for a 10 °C temperature
increase. This must be considered
when warm tyres are checked.
The tyre pressure value displayed in
the Driver Information Centre shows
the real tyre pressure. A cooled down
tyre will show a decreased value,
which does not indicate an air leak.

Vehicle care

187

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The tyre pressure monitoring system
checks the pressure of all four tyres
once a minute when vehicle speed
exceeds a certain limit.

Caution

Tyre pressure monitoring system
warns only about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.
Note
In countries where the tyre pressure
monitoring system is legally
required, the use of wheels without
pressure sensors will invalidate the
vehicle type approval.
The current tyre pressures can be
shown in the Vehicle Information
Menu in the Driver Information
Centre.

Vehicle care

188
The menu can be selected by
pressing the buttons on the turn
signal lever.

Press MENU to select the Vehicle
Information MenuX.

Turn the adjuster wheel to select the
tyre pressure monitoring system.
System status and pressure warnings
are displayed by a message with the
corresponding tyre flashing in the
Driver Information Centre.
The system considers the tyre
temperature for the warnings.
Temperature dependency 3 186.

A detected low tyre pressure
condition is indicated by the control
indicator w 3 89.
If w illuminates, stop as soon as
possible and inflate the tyres as
recommended 3 225.
If w flashes for 60-90 seconds then
illuminates continuously, there is a
fault in the system. Consult a
workshop.
After inflating, some driving may be
required to update the tyre pressure
values in the Driver Information
Centre. During this time w may
illuminate.

Each time the tyres are replaced, tyre
pressure monitoring system sensors
must be dismounted and serviced.
For the screwed sensor; replace
valve core and sealing ring. For the
clipped sensor; replace complete
valve stem.
Vehicle loading status
Adjust tyre pressure to load condition
according to the tyre information label
or tyre pressure chart 3 225, and
select the appropriate setting in the
menu Tyre Load in the Driver
Information Centre, Vehicle
Information Menu 3 90. This setting is
the reference for the tyre pressure
warnings.
The Tyre Load menu only appears if
the vehicle is in a standstill and the
parking brake is applied. On vehicles
with automatic transmission the
selector lever has to be in P.

If w illuminates at lower temperatures
and extinguishes after some driving,
this could be an indicator for
approaching a low tyre pressure
condition. Check tyre pressure.
Vehicle messages 3 97.
If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition.
Only mount wheels with pressure
sensors, otherwise the tyre pressure
will not be displayed and w
illuminates continuously.
A spare wheel or temporary spare
wheel is not equipped with pressure
sensors. The tyre pressure
monitoring system is not operational
for these tyres. Control indicator w
illuminates. For the further three
tyres, the system remains
operational.
The use of commercially-available
liquid tyre repair kits can impair the
function of the system. Factory-
approved repair kits can be used.
Operating electronic devices or being
close to facilities using similar wave
frequencies could disrupt the tyre
pressure monitoring system.

matching process should also be
performed after replacing a spare tyre
with a road tyre containing the TPMS
sensor.
The malfunction light w and the
warning message or code should go
off at the next ignition cycle. The
sensors are matched to the wheel
positions, using a relearn tool, in the
following order: left side front wheel,
right side front wheel, right side rear
wheel and left side rear wheel. The
turn signal light at the current active
position is illuminated until sensor is
matched.
Consult a workshop for service or
purchase a relearn tool. There are
two minutes to match the first wheel
position, and five minutes overall to
match all four wheel positions. If it

207

Adam with foldable sunroof:
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences,
therefore wash your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select one with textile
brushes and select a programme
without wax additives.
Restrictions for filmed or matt painted
body parts or decor tapes, see
"Polishing and waxing".
When hand washing the vehicle, use
clear water and a soft brush, cleaning
in grain direction of the textile sun
roof.
Never use a steam-jet or high-
pressure jet cleaner for the sunroof.
Wax painted parts of the vehicle
regularly, but not the textile of the
sunroof.

Caution

After washing or cleaning, the
foldable sunroof must be
completely dried before opening. If

Vehicle care

a longer time, it would be
damaged by water spotting and
mould growth.

All variants:
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.
If using a car wash, comply with the
car wash manufacturer's instructions.
The windscreen wiper and rear
window wiper must be switched off.
Remove antenna and external
accessories such as roof racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.
Clean bright metal mouldings with a
cleaning solution approved for
aluminium to avoid damages.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of four to nine.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.
Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
On vehicles with emblem touchpad:
when cleaning with a high-pressure
jet cleaner ensure a minimum
distance of 30 cm when working
around the tailgate to prevent
unintended unlocking.
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.

Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax painted parts of the vehicle
regularly (at the latest when water no
longer beads). Otherwise, the
paintwork will dry out.
The foldable sunroof must not be
polished or waxed. When using
automatic car washes, select a
programme without wax additives.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Unpainted plastic body parts must not
be treated with wax or polishing
agents.
Matt filmed body parts or decor tapes
must not be polished, to avoid
gleaming. Do not use hot wax

programmes in automatic car washes
if the vehicle is equipped with these
parts.
Matt painted decor parts, e.g. mirror
housing cover, must not be polished.
Otherwise these parts would become
agleam or the colour would be
dissolved.
Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with a
soft cloth and window cleaner.

Glass panel
Never clean with solvents or abrasive
agents, fuels, aggressive media
(e.g. paint cleaner, acetone-
containing solutions etc.), acidic or
highly alkaline media or abrasive
pads. Do not apply wax or polishing
agents to the glass panel.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.

Vehicle care

209
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Liquid gas system

9 Danger

Liquid gas is heavier than air and
can collect in sink points.
Take care when performing work
at the underbody in a pit.

For painting work and when using a
drying booth at a temperature above
60 °C, the liquid gas tank must be
removed.
Do not make any modifications to the

cleanliness, wear protection and oil
aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.

Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
petrol and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities have to be used.
Recommendations for petrol engines
are also valid for Compressed Natural
Gas (CNG), Liquified Petroleum Gas
(LPG) and Ethanol (E85) fuelled
engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 216.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature

northern countries with very low
temperatures the factory filled coolant
provides frost protection down to
approx. -37 °C. This concentration
should be maintained all year round.
The use of additional coolant
additives that intend to give additional
corrosion protection or seal against
minor leaks can cause function
problems. Liability for consequences
resulting from the use of additional
coolant additives will be rejected.
Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.

Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 216.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only silicate-free long life coolant
(LLC) antifreeze. Consult a
workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C. In

Engine identification
The technical data tables use the
engine identifier code. The engine
data table additionally shows the
engineering code. Engine data

To identify the respective engine,
refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The Certificate of Conformity shows
the engine identifier code, other
national publications may show the
engineering code. Check piston
displacement and engine power to
identify the respective engine.

Identification plate

The identification plate is located on
the left or right front door frame.

Information on identification label:
1 : manufacturer
2 : type approval number
3 : Vehicle Identification Number
4 : permissible gross vehicle weight

5 : permissible gross train weight

6 : maximum permissible front axle

7 : maximum permissible rear axle

rating in kg

load in kg

load in kg

8 : vehicle-specific or country-

specific data

The combined total of front and rear
axle loads must not exceed the
permissible gross vehicle weight. For
example, if the front axle is bearing its
maximum permissible load, the rear
axle can only bear a load that is equal
to the gross vehicle weight minus the
front axle load.
The technical data is determined in
accordance with European
Community standards. We reserve

Paint thickness
Due to production techniques, the
thickness of the paint can vary
between 50 and 400 µm.
Therefore, different paint thickness is
no indicator for a collision damage

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
● operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels)
● status messages of the vehicle
and its single components (e.g.
number of wheel revolutions /
rotational speed, deceleration,
lateral acceleration)

● dysfunctions and defects in

important system components

Customer information
● vehicle reactions in particular

231

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the
stability regulation system)

● environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature)

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimising vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

Customer information

232
When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
