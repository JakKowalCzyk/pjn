 The key allows you to switch on the 
ignition and to mechanically operate 
the lock on the fuel ﬁ ller cap, the glove 
box, the passenger airbag disarming 
switch and the mechanical child lock.  

  ACCESS  
 KEYS   
  Central locking 
 From the driver's door or passenger 
door, the keys allow you to lock, 
deadlock or unlock the doors and 
tailgate, as well as fold back the 
exterior mirrors. 
 If one of the doors or the tailgate is 
open, the central locking does not 
work. 
  The remote control performs the 
same functions at a distance.  

 REMOTE CONTROL 
  Normal locking  

 Press the closed padlock to 
lock the vehicle.  
  This is conﬁ rmed by ﬁ xed 
lighting of the direction 
indicators for approximately 
two seconds.  

  Deadlocking 

 If your vehicle is ﬁ tted with 
deadlocking,  a second 
press  on the closed padlock 
within ﬁ ve seconds of locking 
changes this to deadlocking.  

 This is conﬁ rmed by ﬁ xed lighting 
of the direction indicators for 
approximately two seconds. 

 Deadlocking renders the internal 
and external door locking 
controls inoperative.   Never leave 

anyone inside the vehicle when it is 
deadlocked. 
 If the deadlocking is operated from 
inside the vehicle, it will change to 
normal locking when the vehicle is 
started. 

  Pressing the closed 
padlock for more than 
2 seconds , in addition to 
locking or deadlocking, 
permits automatic closing of 
the windows    and places the sunroofs 
in the partially open position, if they 
were open. To close them completely, 
you must press their switch before 
leaving the vehicle.  

  Unlocking 

 Press the open padlock to 
unlock the vehicle. 
 This is conﬁ rmed by rapid 
ﬂ ashing of the direction 
indicators. 

 If the vehicle is locked and unlocking 
is activated inadvertently, unless the 
doors are opened within 30 seconds, 
the vehicle will lock automatically.  

  Opening/Closing the electric 
sliding side doors 

 Pressing one of the buttons 
opens or closes the 
corresponding rear door 
(right or left). 

 This press unlocks the entire 
vehicle before opening the sliding 
door.   

  Folding/opening out the key

 To tuck away the key blade, 
press the button, then fold it

module. 
 To open out the key, press the 
button.  

  Locating your vehicle 

 To locate your vehicle, if you 
have locked it, in a car park. 
  Press the closed padlock, the 
courtesy lights come on and 
the direction indicators ﬂ ash 
for a few seconds.

  Changing the remote control 
battery 
 Battery ref.: CR1620/3 volts. 
 The information "battery ﬂ at" is given 
by an audible signal, accompanied by 
a message on the multifunction display. 
 To replace the battery, unclip the 
casing using a coin at the ring. 
 If the remote control does not work 
after the battery has been changed, 
re-programme the remote control.  

 Do not discard the remote control 
batteries, they contain metals which 
are harmful to the environment. 
   Take them to a  CITROËN dealer , or to 
any other approved collection point.  

  Reinitialising the remote control 

 Following changing of the 
remote control battery or 
disconnection of the vehicle 
battery, the remote control 
may have to be reinitialised. 
 Wait at least one minute 
before using the remote 
control. 
 Insert the key in the ignition 
switch with the buttons 
(padlocks) of the remote control 
facing you. 
 Switch on the ignition. 
 Press the locking padlock for at 
least ﬁ ve seconds within the next 
ten seconds. 
 Switch off the ignition. 
 Wait at least one minute before using 
the remote control. 
 The remote control is now working 
again.  

 ELECTRONIC ENGINE
IMMOBILISER 
 This locks the engine control system as 
soon as the ignition has been switched 
off and therefore prevents starting of 
the vehicle by anyone who does not 
have the key. 
 The ignition key has an electronic 
chip which has a special code. When 
the ignition is switched on, the code 
must be recognised for starting to be 
possible. 
 If the system does not function 
correctly, the central locking button 
indicator light, situated on the courtesy 
light console, ﬂ ashes rapidly when the 
ignition is switched on (2nd notch). 
 In this case your vehicle will not start. 
   Contact a  CITROËN dealer  as soon as 
possible. 

  Good practice 
  Key, remote control 
 Take care not to allow the key to come 
into contact with grease, dust, rain or a 
damp environment. 
 A heavy object attached to the key 
(key ring, ...) weighing on the shaft 
of the key in the switch may cause a 
malfunction. 
 The high frequency remote control is 
a sensitive system; do not operate it 
while it is in your pocket as there is 
a possibility that it may unlock your 
vehicle, without you being aware of it. 

 Do not repeatedly press the buttons of 
your remote control out of range and 
out of sight of your vehicle. You run 
the risk of stopping it from working and 
the remote control would have to be 
reprogrammed. 
 The remote control does not operate 
when the key is in the ignition, even 
when the ignition is switched off, 
except for reprogramming. 
 Do not make any modiﬁ cations to the 
electronic engine immobiliser system.  

   Access   

  If the keys are lost 
 A CITROËN dealer will be able 
to retrieve the key code and the 
transponder code to order a 
replacement key if you show him your 
V5 registration certiﬁ cate and personal 
identiﬁ cation.

  Safety 
 In the event of a serious impact the 
doors are unlocked automatically 
to permit access by the emergency 
services. 
 Remove the ignition key when you 
leave the vehicle, even for a short time, 
if there are children on board.  

  Purchasing a second-hand vehicle 
 Ensure that you are given the anti-theft 
socket for alloy wheels (remember to 
note the code engraved on the head of 
the socket). 
 Have the key codes memorised by a 
CITROËN dealer, to ensure that the 
keys in your possession are the only 
ones which can start the vehicle.

 ALARM
 If ﬁ tted on your vehicle, this provides 
two types of protection: 
   -   exterior protection: it sounds if a 
door, the tailgate or the bonnet is 
opened. 
interior protection: it sounds if 
the volume inside the passenger 
compartment changes (breaking of 
a window or a movement inside the 
vehicle).  

  -  

 A red indicator light, located in the 
centre of the fascia, indicates the 
information detailed below. 
  Setting the alarm 
    -    Switch off the ignition and get out of 

the vehicle. 

   -    Set the alarm within ﬁ ve minutes of 
getting out of the vehicle, by locking 
or deadlocking using the remote 
control (the red indicator light 
ﬂ ashes once per second).  

    -    Close the sunroofs, 
   -    Switch off the ignition, 
   -   

In the next ten seconds, press 
button  A , located on the left-hand 
side of the fascia, until the red 
indicator light is on continuously, 

   -    Get out of the vehicle, 
   -    Within the next ﬁ ve minutes, set the 
alarm by locking or deadlocking using 
the remote control (the red indicator 
light ﬂ ashes once a second).  
 When the alarm is set but the 
remote control does not operate: 

 To lock your vehicle without setting the 
alarm, insert the key in the lock then 
lock the vehicle (e.g. for washing). 
 When the alarm is triggered, the siren 

sounds and the direction indicator lights 
ﬂ ash for thirty seconds. 
 Warning - alarm triggered: the red indicator 
light ﬂ ashes rapidly, insert the key and 
switch on the ignition to switch it off. 
 When the alarm has been triggered ten 
times in succession (on the eleventh time) 
the alarm is deactivated. Repeat the rules 
for setting the alarm.  
  Disarming 
 Unlock the vehicle with the remote 
control (the red indicator light goes out).  
  To set the alarm with exterior 
protection only 
 If, while you are away from the vehicle, 
you wish to leave a window partially 
open or a pet inside the vehicle, you 
should choose exterior protection only. 

    -    Unlock the doors with the key 

and open the door. The alarm is 
triggered. 

   -    Switch on the ignition in the 

next ten seconds. The alarm is 
disarmed.   

  Incorrect operation 
 When the ignition is switched on, if the red 
indicator light remains on for ten seconds, 
there is a fault in the siren connection. 
  Consult a CITROËN dealer  to have the 
system checked.  
  Automatic setting of the alarm 
 If ﬁ tted on your vehicle, the alarm is set 
automatically 2 minutes after the last 
door or the tailgate is closed. 
 To prevent triggering of the alarm when 
a door or the tailgate is opened, it is 
imperative to press the remote control 
unlocking button again. 

 Do not make any modiﬁ cations 
to the alarm system as this could 
cause faults.

 DOORS

  Locking/Unlocking from 
the inside 
 Press the padlock, the red 
warning light comes on when 

the vehicle is locked and switches off 
when it is unlocked. 
 This locks/unlocks the doors and the 
tailgate. 

 If the vehicle is locked or 
deadlocked from the outside, the 
red warning light ﬂ ashes and the 

padlock does not function. In this case, 
use the key or the remote control to 
unlock from the outside. 
 The door opening switches do 
not function when the vehicle is 
deadlocked.  

  Automatic central locking

required operation, either inside or 
outside the vehicle. 
 Do not lean through an open window, 
do not leave any object protruding 
through the door during opening or 
closing. 
 Do not leave children or pets near the 
opening and closing controls without 
supervision.  

  Obstacle detection 
 The detection system is triggered 
when an obstacle which has a certain 
physical resistance hinders the 
movement of the door. 
 If an obstacle is detected during: 
   -   closing of the door, the door opens 

fully, 

  -   opening of the door, the door stops.  
 When the obstacle has been removed, 
complete or restart the action using the 
remote control or the interior controls. 
 Failure to observe these 
recommendations may result in injury 
or damage if part of the body or an 
object becomes jammed or caught.

snowﬂ ake on the instrument panel. 
 In this situation the gearbox operates 
in downgrade mode (locked in 3rd 
gear). You may feel a substantial knock 
when changing from  P  to  R  and from  N  
to  R  (this will not cause any damage to 
the gearbox). 
 Do not exceed 60 mph (100 km/h), 
keeping within the limit of local speed 
restrictions. 
 Contact a CITROËN dealer as soon as 
possible.  

 You can return to the automatic 
programme at any time. 

   -   Press button (cid:55) again to switch off 

the programme you are in.   

  Good practice 
 Never select position  N  when the 
vehicle is moving. 
 Never select positions  P  or  R  unless 
the vehicle is stationary. 
 Never change between positions to 
optimise braking on a slippery surface. 
 There is a risk of damage to the 
gearbox: 
   -  

if you press the accelerator and 
brake pedals at the same time, 
if you force the lever from position  P  
to another position in the event of a 
battery failure.  

  -  

 When the engine is at idle, brakes 
not applied, if position  R ,  D  or  M  is 
selected the vehicle moves even 
without the accelerator being pressed. 
 For this reason,  do not leave children 
unsupervised inside the vehicle, 
with the engine running .

 MANUAL GEARBOX
 To change gear easily, always press 
the clutch pedal fully. 
 To prevent the mat from becoming 
caught under the pedal: 
   -   ensure that the mat is positioned 

correctly,  

  -   never ﬁ t one mat on top of another.  
 When driving, avoid leaving your hand 
on the gear knob as the force exerted, 
even if slight, may wear the internal 
components of the gearbox over time.  

  Reverse gear (6-speed) 
 Raise the collar under the gear knob to 
engage reverse gear. 
 Never engage reverse gear before the 
vehicle is completely stationary. 
 The lever should be moved slowly to 
reduce the noise on engaging reverse 
gear.

 This cruise control shows the function 
selection status on the instrument 
panel and displays the programmed 
speed: 

 CRUISE CONTROL "CRUISE" 

 "This is the speed at which the driver 
wishes to drive". 
 This aid to driving in free-ﬂ owing 
trafﬁ c enables the vehicle to maintain 
the speed programmed by the driver, 
unless a steep gradient makes this 
impossible. 
 In order for it to be programmed or 
activated, the vehicle speed must be 
greater than 25 mph (40 km/h) with at 
least 4th gear engaged in the case of 
vehicles ﬁ tted with a manual gearbox. 

 On vehicles ﬁ tted with an automatic 
gearbox, the lever must be in 
position  D  (Drive) or at least 2nd gear 
must be engaged in manual mode. 

 If the vehicle is ﬁ tted with a speed

  Changing the 
programmed speed 
 There are two methods 
of memorising a 
speed higher than the 
previous one: 
 Without using the accelerator: 
   -   press the  Set +  button.  
 A brief press increases the speed by 
1 mph (km/h). 
 A maintained press increases the 
speed in steps of 5 mph (km/h). 
 Using the accelerator: 
   -   exceed the memorised speed until 

the speed required is reached, 
  -   press the  Set +  or  Set -  button.  

 To memorise a speed lower than the 
previous one: 
   -   press the  Set -  button.  
 A brief press decreases the speed by 
1 mph (km/h). 
 A maintained press decreases the 
speed in steps of 5 mph (km/h).  

  Switching the function off 
   -   Place the dial in position  0  or switch 
off the ignition to switch everything 
off.   

  Cancelling the programmed 
reference speed 
 When the vehicle becomes stationary, 
after switching off the ignition, the 
system no longer memorises a speed.  

  Operating fault 
 The programmed speed is cleared and 
the dashes ﬂ ash for a few seconds. 
 Consult a CITROËN dealer to have the 
system checked.  

  Good practice 
 When changing the programmed 

reference speed by means of a 
maintained press, pay attention as 
the speed can increase or decrease 
rapidly. 
 Do not use the cruise control on 
slippery roads or in heavy trafﬁ c. 
 In the event of a steep slope, the cruise 
control cannot prevent the vehicle from 
exceeding the programmed speed. 
 In any event, the cruise control cannot 
replace the need to observe the speed 
limits, nor can it replace the need for 
vigilance and responsibility on the part 
of the driver. 
 You are advised to keep your feet near 
the pedals. 
 To avoid any jamming under the 
pedals: 
   -   ensure that the mat and its ﬁ xings 

on the ﬂ oor are positioned correctly, 

  -   never place one mat on top of 

another

 SPEED LIMITER "LIMIT" 
 "This is the selected speed which the 
driver does not wish to exceed". 
 This selection is made with the engine 
running while stationary or with the 
vehicle moving. The minimum speed 
which can be programmed is 20 mph 
(30 km/h). 
 The speed of the vehicle responds 
to the pressure of the driver's foot as 
far as the accelerator pedal point of 
resistance which indicates that the 
programmed speed has been reached. 
 However, pressing the pedal beyond 
this point of resistance to the ﬂ oor 
permits exceeding of the programmed 
speed. 

 To resume use of the limiter, simply 
reduce the pressure on the accelerator 
pedal gradually and return to a speed 
below that programmed. 
 If the vehicle is ﬁ tted with a speed 
limiter and cruise control (according 
to the country in which the vehicle is 
sold and the engine), these functions 
cannot be activated at the same time  . 
  The operating actions can be carried 
out when stationary, with the engine 
running, or with the vehicle moving.

  Activation/Deactivation (off) 
 Pressing this button once activates 
the limiter, pressing the button again 
deactivates it (OFF).  

  Programming a speed 
 A speed can be programmed without 
activating the limiter but with the 
engine running. 
 To memorise a speed higher than the 
previous one: 
   -   press the  Set +  button.  
 A brief press increases the speed by
1 mph (km/h). 
 A maintained press increases the 
speed in steps of 5 mph (km/h).

 A maintained press decreases the 
speed in steps of 5 mph (km/h).  

  Exceeding the programmed 
speed 
 Pressing the accelerator pedal in order 
to exceed the programmed speed 
will have no effect unless you press 
the pedal  ﬁ rmly  beyond the  point of 
resistance . 
 The limiter is deactivated temporarily 
and the programmed speed ﬂ ashes. 
 To return to the limiter function, reduce 
your speed to below the programmed 
speed. 

  Flashing of the speed 
 The speed ﬂ ashes: 
   -  

following forcing of the accelerator 
point of resistance, 

  -   when the limiter cannot prevent an

nor can it replace the need for vigilance 
and responsibility on the part of the driver. 
 Always pay attention to the proﬁ le of the 
road, take care on sharp acceleration and 
stay in complete control of your vehicle.  

    To avoid any jamming under the

 VENTILATION 
 CORRECT USE OF THE 
VENTILATION AND AIR
CONDITIONING 

  Vents 
  "Leave them open"  
 For optimum distribution and diffusion 
of hot or cool air in the passenger 
compartment, there are adjustable 
central and side vents which can be 
directed sideways (right or left) towards 
the top of the body. For your comfort 
while driving, do not close them, direct 
the ﬂ ow of air towards the windows 
instead. 
 The air vents directed towards the ﬂ oor 
of the vehicle complete the equipment.  

  Air conditioning 
 In all seasons, the air conditioning 
should only be used with the windows 
closed. However, if the interior 
temperature remains high after a 
prolonged period parked in the sun, do 
not hesitate to ventilate the passenger 
compartment for a few minutes. 
 Use the AUTO mode as much as 
possible as it permits optimised 
control of all of the functions: air ﬂ ow, 
passenger compartment comfort 
temperature, air distribution, air 
intake mode or air recirculation in the 
passenger compartment. 
 Operate the air conditioning system for 
5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a month, 
to keep it in perfect working order. 
 It is normal that the condensation 
created by the air conditioning system 
results in a ﬂ ow of water which may 
form a puddle under the vehicle when 
parked. 
 If the system does not produce cold air, 
do not use it and consult a CITROËN 
dealer.

 DE-ICING AND DEMISTING 
  De-icing the rear screen 
and mirrors 

 Press this button, with the 
engine running, to de-ice the 
rear screen and mirrors. 
 The de-icing indicator light 
comes on. The duration 
of de-icing depends on the exterior 
temperature. 
 Pressing the button again reactivates 
the de-icing. 

 It is possible to stop the de-
icing before it is switched off 
automatically by pressing this 
button again.  

  Demisting, 
visibility programme 

 The comfort programme 
may not be sufﬁ cient to 
quickly demist or de-ice the 
windows (humidity, several 
passengers, ice). 

 In this case, select the visibility 
programme. The visibility programme 
indicator light comes on. 

 It activates the air conditioning, the air 
ﬂ ow, the de-icing of the rear screen 
and provides optimum distribution of 
the ventilation to the windscreen and 
side windows. 
 It deactivates the air recirculation.  

  ADDITIONAL HEATER 
 To improve your comfort, vehicles ﬁ tted 
with an HDi engine may be ﬁ tted with 
automatic additional heating. 
 However, with the engine at idle or 
when the vehicle is stationary, 
it is normal to notice a high-pitched 
whistling and a slight emission of 
smoke and odour.

 Located on the centre console, the 
control panel is to the right of the gear 
lever. 
 The driver and front passenger can 
each adjust the air temperature to suit 
their requirements. 
 They can also activate or disarm the 
rear ventilation adjustment controls. 

 Do not cover the sunshine sensor 
located in the centre of the fascia. 
This is used to regulate the air 
conditioning. 

  1 - AUTO mode  
 This is the normal air 
conditioning operating mode. 

   -   Press the  "AUTO"  button.  
 Depending on the comfort temperature 
selected, the system controls the air 
distribution, ﬂ ow and intake so that the 
passenger compartment is comfortable 
and has an adequate circulation of air. 
You do not have to make any further 
adjustments. 
 When the engine is cold, in order 
to prevent a rush of cold air, the

 DRIVING SAFELY 
 HANDBRAKE
  Applying 
 When parking, pull the handbrake to 
immobilize your vehicle. When parking 
on a slope, direct your wheels towards 
the pavement and pull the handbrake.    

  Releasing 
 Pull on the handle and press the button 
to release the handbrake.  

  Disengaging 
 If your vehicle is ﬁ tted with a version 
with a rotating front seat, apply the 
handbrake. 

 Pull the button located at the end of the 
handbrake forwards. 
 The handbrake lever lowers. 
 You can now pivot the seat. 
 To return to normal operation, pull the 
lever upwards until a click is heard. 
 If the handbrake is still on or has 
not been released properly, this is 
indicated by: 

 a warning light which comes 
on on the instrument panel, 
 an audible signal, 
 a message on the display.   

 HAZARD WARNING LIGHTS
 Press the button, the direction 
indicators ﬂ ash. 
 They can operate with the ignition off. 

  Automatic lighting of hazard 
warning lights 
 Equipment conditioned according 
to country: when braking in an 
emergency, depending on the 
deceleration, the hazard warning lights 
come on automatically. They switch 
off automatically the ﬁ rst time you 
accelerate. 
 It is also possible to switch them off by 
pressing the button.  

Parking sensors

 When the distance between the vehicle 
and the obstacle is less than approximately 
thirty centimetres, the audible signal 
becomes continuous and the "Danger" 
symbol appears depending on the display.  
  Switching the system off 
 The system returns to the inactive 
status: 
   -   when you exit reverse gear, 
  -   when the speed increases to above 

6 mph (10 km/h), 

  -   at the end of the manoeuvre, when 

the vehicle becomes stationary 
(front parking assistance only).   

 FRONT AND/OR REAR
PARKING ASSISTANCE 
 If ﬁ tted on your vehicle, the system is 
audible and/or visual and consists of 
four proximity sensors, located in the 
front and/or rear bumper. The sensors 
detect any obstacle which enters 
the ﬁ eld: person, vehicle, tree, gate, 
located in front of or behind the vehicle 
during the manoeuvre. 
 Objects the size or thickness of which 
is detected at the beginning of the 
manoeuvre, may no longer be detected 
at the end of the manoeuvre: due to 
blind spots between and below the 
sensors. Examples: stake, roadworks 
cone, kerbstone. 
 This system does not take the place of 
the vigilance and responsibility of the 
driver. 

  Switching the system on 
 The system is activated as soon as: 
   -  
  -  

reverse gear is engaged, 
the speed falls below 6 mph
(10 km/h) in forward gear.  

 This is accompanied by an audible 
signal and displaying of the vehicle, 
depending on the display. 
 The proximity information is given by: 
   -   an audible signal, which becomes 

more rapid as the vehicle 
approaches the obstacle, 

  -   a graphic on the display, with 

blocks which become progressively 
closer to the vehicle.  

 The obstacle is located in relation to 
the emission of the audible signal from 
the speakers, front or rear and right 
or left. 

  Deactivation 

 Press the button on the fascia 
to deactivate the system 
(to avoid waking a child...). 
The indicator light on the 
button comes on. 

 This function will be deactivated 
automatically when the vehicle is 
towing a trailer or when a bicycle 

carrier is ﬁ tted (vehicle ﬁ tted with 
towing attachment or bicycle carrier 
recommended by CITROËN).  
 RE-ACTIVATION 
  Press the button again to re-activate 
the system. The indicator light on the 
button switches off. 

 In bad or wintry weather, ensure 
that the sensors are not covered 
with mud, frost or snow. 

 In this case (e.g. sensors dirty), when 
reverse gear is engaged, the indicator 
light ﬂ ashes, accompanied by an 
audible signal and a message on the 
display. 
 Consult a CITROËN dealer.

ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM 
(ABS) AND ELECTRONIC 
BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION 
(EBFD) 
 The ABS, in conjunction with the 
electronic brake force distribution, 
increases the stability and 
manoeuvrability of your vehicle on 
braking, in particular on poor or 
slippery road surfaces. 

 EMERGENCY BRAKING 
ASSISTANCE SYSTEM (EBA)
 In an emergency, this system enables 
the optimum braking pressure to be 
reached more quickly, press the pedal 
ﬁ rmly without releasing it. 
 It is triggered by the speed at which the 
brake pedal is activated. 
 To prolong the operation of the 
emergency braking assistance system: 
keep your foot on the brake pedal. 
 This alters the resistance of the brake 
pedal under your foot. 

 When changing wheels (tyres and 
rims), make sure that these are 
approved. 

 The anti-lock braking system comes 
into operation automatically when there 
is a risk of wheel lock. 

 When this warning light 
comes on, accompanied by 
a buzzer and a message, 
it indicates that there is a 
malfunction of the ABS, which 

can cause a loss of control of the 
vehicle when braking. 

 When this warning light comes 
on, connected to the  STOP  
warning light, accompanied 
by a buzzer and a message, 
it indicates that there is a 

malfunction of the electronic brake force 
distribution, which can cause a loss of 
control of the vehicle when braking. 
  Stop immediately.  

  In both cases, consult a CITROËN 
dealer. 

 Normal operation of the ABS may 
make itself felt by slight vibrations of 
the brake pedal. 
  In emergency braking, press 
very ﬁ rmly without releasing the 
pressure.  

 TRACTION CONTROL (ASR) 
AND DYNAMIC STABILITY 
CONTROL (ESP) 

  These systems are linked and 
complement the ABS. 
 The ASR system optimises drive to 
prevent the wheels skidding, by acting 
on the brakes of the drive wheels 
and on the engine. It also allows the 
directional stability of the vehicle to be 
improved on acceleration. 
 If there is a variation between the 
trajectory followed by the vehicle and 
that required by the driver, the ESP 
system automatically acts on the 
engine and the brake of one or more 
wheels, in order to put the vehicle back 
on course, within the limits of the laws 
of physics. 

  Activation of the ASR and ESP 
systems 
 When the ignition is on, the ASR and 
ESP systems are always active.  

  Operation of the ASR and 
ESP systems 
 The warning light ﬂ ashes if 
the ASR or ESP is activated.   

Driving safely

  They engage again: 
- 

  automatically above 30 mph 
(50 km/h),  
 manually by pressing the switch 
again.   

- 

  Operating check 

 When a malfunction of the 
systems occurs, the indicator 
light comes on, accompanied 
by an audible signal and a 
message on the display. 

  Consult a CITROËN dealer  to have the 
system checked. 

 The ASR/ESP systems offer 
increased safety during normal 
driving, but should not incite the 
driver to take risks or to drive at high 
speed. 
   The operation of these systems is 
ensured if the recommendations 
of the manufacturer regarding 
the wheels (tyres and rims), the 
braking components, the electronic 
components and the ﬁ tting and repair 
procedures within the  CITROËN 
network  are observed. 
   After an impact, have these systems 
checked by a  CITROËN dealer .   

  Disarming the ASR/ESP 
systems 
 In certain conditions (vehicle stuck in 
mud or snow, or on loose ground...), it 
could prove useful to disarm the ASR 
and ESP systems to make the wheels 
spin and regain grip. 
- 

  Press the switch, situated under 
the steering wheel on the left of the 
fascia.  

 The indicator light comes on 
accompanied by a message: 
the ESP and ASR systems 
no longer act on the engine 
operation, but continue to act 
on the brakes.

 TYRE UNDER-INFLATION
DETECTION
 Sensors check the tyre pressure during 
driving, and trigger a warning in the 
event of a malfunction (speed greater 
than approx.15 mph [25 km/h]) or 
puncture. 
 An outline representing one or more 
wheels ﬂ ashing indicates the location 
of the wheel or wheels concerned. 

  Flat tyre 
 The SERVICE warning light 
comes on, accompanied 
by the message  "Tyre(s) 

deﬂ ated" , an outline on the display, 
and an audible signal. 
 Check the tyre pressure as soon as 
possible.  

 This message is also displayed 
when one of the tyres is away 
from the vehicle (being repaired) 

or when a wheel without a sensor is 
ﬁ tted. 

 All repairs and changing of 
tyres on a wheel ﬁ tted with this 
system must be carried out by a 
CITROËN dealer. 

  The tyre under-inﬂ ation detection 
system is a driving aid which does 
not take the place of   the   vigilance or 
the responsibility of the driver.  
 This system does not remove the 
need to have the tyre pressure 
checked regularly (including the spare 
wheel), to ensure that the dynamic 
performance of the vehicle remains at 
its best and to avoid premature wear 
of the tyres, in particular in the case 
of arduous driving (heavy load, high 
speed). 
 The system may temporarily be 
disturbed by radio broadcasts on a 
frequency close to it.  

  Puncture 
 The STOP warning light 
comes on, accompanied 
by the message 
 "Punctured tyre(s)" , an outline on the 
display and an audible signal. 
 Stop immediately, avoiding any sudden 
movement of the steering wheel and 
the brakes. 
 Change the damaged (punctured or 
very deﬂ ated) tyre, and have the tyre 
pressure checked as soon as possible. 

 Refer to the "Changing a wheel" 
section of chapter 7. 

 If the damaged tyre is temporarily 
stored in the boot, it will again emit 
this message to remind you of the 
necessity of having it repaired. This will 
prevent another warning of the same 
type being displayed.  

  Sensor(s) not detected 
 The SERVICE warning light 
comes on, accompanied 
by the message  "X tyre 
pressure sensor(s) missing" , an 
outline on the display and an audible 
signal. 
 Under-inﬂ ation detection is absent 
from one (or several) tyre(s). Consult a 
CITROËN dealer to replace the faulty 
sensor(s). 

   Seat belts   

 The force-limiting device reduces the 
pressure of the seat belt against the 
chest of the occupant, so increasing 
his protection.

  Front seat belt warning light 
 If the driver and/or front 
passenger has/have not 
fastened his/their seat belt, this 

warning light comes on. 
 Then, at a speed in excess of 
approximately 15 mph (25 km/h), it ﬂ ashes 
accompanied by an audible signal of 
increasing volume (for approximately 
90 seconds) and a message on the display. 

  A bag placed on the front 
passenger seat or a pet sitting on 
this seat may trigger the lighting of 
this warning light.  

  Row 2 rear side seat belts 
 For your comfort, if you are not using 
the seat belt, slide the seat belt loop to 
the upper stop to prevent the tongue 
from vibrating.  

  Row 3 rear side seat belts

 Check that the seat belt is fastened 
correctly by pulling the strap.  
  Inertia reel seat belts 
 These are ﬁ tted with a device which 
locks the seat belt automatically in 
the event of an impact or emergency 
braking. 
 Safety in the event of a frontal impact 
has been improved by the introduction 
of pre-tensioning and force-limiting 
seat belts. Depending on the 
seriousness of the impact, the 
pre-tensioning system instantly 
tightens the seat belts ﬁ rmly against 
the body of the occupant. 
 The pre-tensioning seat belts are 
armed when the ignition is on.

 To install the seat belt, move the 
tongue into position to insert it into the 
buckle.  
  Row 2 and 3 rear centre seat 
belts 
 The row 2 rear centre seat and the 
rear bench seat centre seat have an 
integrated three-point inertia reel seat 
belt.  

  Good practice 
 The driver must ensure that 
passengers use the seat belts correctly 
and that they are all strapped in 
securely before moving off. 
 Wherever you are seated in the 
vehicle, always fasten your seat belt, 
even for short journeys. 
 The seat belts are ﬁ tted with an inertia 
reel which automatically adjusts the 
length of the strap to your size. 
 Do not use accessories (clothes pegs, 
clips, safety pins, etc.) which permit a 
clearance with the seat belt straps. 
 Ensure that the seat belt is rolled up 
correctly after use. 
 After folding or moving a seat or a rear 
bench seat, ensure that the seat belt is 
rolled up correctly and that the buckle 
is ready to accommodate the tongue. 

 Depending on the nature and 
seriousness of any impact, the 
pretensioning device may be triggered 
before and independently of inﬂ ation 
of the airbags. It instantly tightens 
the seat belts against the body of the 
occupants.
Triggering of the pretensioners is 
accompanied by a slight discharge 
of harmless smoke and a noise, due 
to the activation of the pyrotechnic 
cartridge incorporated in the system. 
 The force limiter reduces the pressure 
of the seat belt against the body of the 
occupants. 
   The pretensioning seat belts are active 
when the ignition is switched on. 
 The inertia reels are ﬁ tted with a device 
which automatically locks the strap in 
the event of a collision or emergency 
braking or if the vehicle rolls over. 
 You can unfasten the seat belt by 
pressing the red button on the buckle. 
Guide the seat belt after unfastening. 

 The airbag warning light comes on 
if the pretensioners are triggered. 
Consult a CITROËN dealer. 
 In order to be effective, a seat belt 
must: 
   -  
  -   must not be twisted, check by 

restrain one person only, 

pulling in front of you with an even 
movement, 

  -   be tightened as close to the body 

as possible.  

 The upper part of the seat belt should 
be positioned in the hollow of the 
shoulder. 
 The lap part should be placed as low 
as possible on the pelvis. 
 Do not invert the seat belt buckles as 
they will not fulﬁ l their role completely. 
If the seats are ﬁ tted with armrests, the 
lap part of the seat belt should always 
pass under the armrest. 
 Check that the seat belt is fastened 
correctly by pulling the strap ﬁ rmly. 

  Recommendations for children: 
   -   use a suitable child seat if the 
passenger is less than 12 years old 
or shorter than one metre ﬁ fty, 
  -   never allow a child to travel on 

your lap, even with the seat belt 
fastened.  

 For further information regarding child 
seats, refer to the "Children on board" 
section of chapter 4. 
 In accordance with current safety 
regulations, your CITROËN dealer 
guarantees all work or any checks, 
from testing to maintenance, on your 
seat belt equipment. 
 Have the seat belts checked regularly 
(even after a minor impact) by a 
CITROËN dealer: they must not show 
any signs of wear, cutting or fraying 
and they must not be transformed or 
modiﬁ ed. 
 Clean the seat belt straps with soapy 
water or a textile cleaning product, sold 
by CITROËN dealers.

Airbags
  Airbags only operate when the 
ignition is switched on. 

 This equipment only operates once. 
If a second impact occurs (during the 
same or a subsequent accident), the 
airbag will not operate. 
 The triggering of an airbag or airbags 
is accompanied by a slight discharge 
of harmless smoke and a noise, due 
to the activation of the pyrotechnic 
cartridge incorporated in the system. 
 This smoke is not harmful, but 
sensitive individuals may experience 
some irritation. 
 The noise of the detonation may result 
in a slight loss of hearing for a short 
time. 

 It is imperative that the passenger 
airbag is disarmed if a child seat is 
installed facing rearwards. Refer 
to the "Children on board" section of 
chapter 4.

 AIRBAGS 
 The airbags have been designed to 
maximise the safety of the occupants 
(with the exception of the centre 
seats of rows 2 and 3) in the event 
of a serious collision; they work in 
conjunction with the force limiting 
seat belts. 
 In the event of a serious collision, the 
electronic detectors record and analyse 
the front and side impacts suffered in 
the impact detection zones: 
   -  

in the event of a serious impact, the 
airbags inﬂ ate instantly and protect 
the occupants of the vehicle.  

 Immediately after the impact, the 
airbags deﬂ ate rapidly, so that they 
do not hinder the visibility of the 
occupants nor their possible exit from 
the vehicle: 
   -  

in the event of a minor or rear 
impact and in certain roll-over 
conditions, the airbags will not 
be deployed; the seat belt alone 
is sufﬁ cient to provide maximum 
protection in these situations.  
 The seriousness of the collision 
depends on the nature of the obstacle 
and the speed of the vehicle at the 
moment of impact.  

  Side airbags 
   Only put approved covers on the seats. 
These will not hinder inﬂ ation of the 
side airbags.  Consult a CITROËN 
dealer.
 Do not ﬁ x or glue anything to the seat 
backs. This could cause injury to the 
chest or arms when the side airbag 
inﬂ ates. 
   Do not sit with the upper part of the 
body any nearer to the door than 
necessary.  

  Front airbags 
 Do not drive holding the steering wheel 
by its spokes or resting your hands on 
the centre part of the wheel. 
 Passengers must not place their feet 
on the fascia. 
 Smoke as little as possible as 
deployment of the airbags can cause 
burns or the risk of injury from a 
cigarette or pipe. 
 Never remove or pierce the steering 
wheel or hit it violently.   

  Curtain airbags 
 Do not ﬁ x or glue anything to the roof. 
This could cause injury to the head 
when the curtain airbag inﬂ ates. 
 Do not remove the grab handles 
installed on the roof, they play a part 
in securing the curtain airbags.

   Airbags   
  Good practice 
 If your vehicle is ﬁ tted with a front 
passenger airbag, side airbags or 
curtain airbags, observe this good 
practice. 
 Sit in a normal upright position. 
 Wear a correctly adjusted seat belt. 
 Do not leave anything between the 
occupants and the airbags (a child, 
pet, object...). This could hamper the 
operation of the airbags or injure the 
occupants. 
 After an accident or if the vehicle has 
been stolen or broken into, have the 
airbag systems checked. 
   All work on the airbag system is strictly 
forbidden unless it is carried out by 
qualiﬁ ed personnel of the  CITROËN 
network . 

 Even if all of the precautions 
mentioned are observed, a risk of 
injury or of minor burns to the head, 
chest or arms when an airbag is 
triggered cannot be ruled out. In fact, 
the bag inﬂ ates almost instantly (within 
a few milliseconds) then deﬂ ates within 
the same time discharging the hot gas 
via openings provided for this purpose. 

Airbags

 The curtain airbag inﬂ ates between the 
front or rear occupant of the vehicle 
and the windows. 

5
9

 In the event of a minor impact or 
bump on the side of the vehicle or 
if the vehicle rolls over, the airbag 
may not be triggered. 

 The airbag is not triggered in the event 
of a rear or front collision.  

  Side airbags 
 If ﬁ tted on your vehicle, this is a system 
which protects the driver and front 
passenger in the event of a serious 
side impact in order to limit the risk of 
injury to the chest. 
 Each side airbag is incorporated in the 
front seat back frame, on the door side. 

  Activation 
 It is triggered unilaterally in the event 
of a serious side impact applied to 
all or part of the side impact zone  B , 
perpendicular to the longitudinal 
centreline of the vehicle on a horizontal 
plane and directed from the outside 
towards the inside of the vehicle. 
 The side airbag inﬂ ates between the 
front occupant of the vehicle and the 
corresponding door trim pad.  

  Impact detection zones 
   A.   Front impact zone. 
  B.   Side impact zone.    

  Curtain airbags 
 If ﬁ tted on your vehicle, this is a 
system which protects the driver and 
passengers (with the exception of the 
centre seats of rows 2 and 3) in the 
event of a serious side impact in order 
to limit the risk of head injuries. 
 Each curtain airbag is incorporated in 
the pillars and the upper part of the

  Front airbags 
 The front airbags are incorporated in 
the centre of the steering wheel for the 
driver and in the fascia for the front 
passenger. 

  Activation 
 They are deployed simultaneously, 
unless the passenger's front airbag 
has been disarmed, in the event of a 
serious front impact applied to all or 
part of the front impact zone  A  in the 
longitudinal centreline of the vehicle 
on a horizontal plane directed from the 
front towards the rear of the vehicle. 
 The front airbag inﬂ ates between 
the front occupant of the vehicle and 
the fascia to cushion his forward 
movement.  

 To ensure the safety of your 
child, it is essential to disarm the 
passenger airbag when you install 

a rear-facing child seat on the front 
passenger seat. Otherwise, the child 
would risk being killed or seriously 
injured if the airbag were to inﬂ ate.  

  Reactivation 
 In the  "OFF"  position, the passenger 
airbag will not be triggered in the event 
of an impact. 
 As soon as the child seat is removed, 
turn the airbag slot to the  "ON"  
position to re-activate the airbag 
and thus ensure the safety of your 
passenger in the event of an impact.  

  Front airbag fault 

 If this warning light comes on, 
accompanied by an audible 
signal and a message on the 
display, consult a CITROËN 
dealer to have the system 
checked. 

 If the two airbag warning lights 
are lit continuously, do not install 
a rear-facing child seat. Consult a 
CITROËN dealer.   

  Disarming 
 The passenger's front airbag alone can 
be disarmed: 
  -   

 With   the   ignition   switched   off , 
insert the key into the passenger 
airbag disarming switch, 
turn it to the  "OFF"  position, 
then remove the key keeping the 
slot in this position.

 CHILD SAFETY 

 GENERAL POINTS RELATING
TO CHILD SEATS
  Although one of CITROËN's main 
criteria when designing your vehicle, 
the safety of your children also 
depends on you. 
 For maximum safety, please follow 
these precautions: 
   -   all children under the age of 12 or 
less than one metre ﬁ fty tall must 
travel in approved child seats suited 
to their weight, on seats ﬁ tted with 
a seat belt or ISOFIX mountings, 

  -   statistically, the safest seats in your 

vehicle for the transportation of 
children are the rear seats, 

  -   a child weighing less than 9 kg 
must travel in the "rearwards-
facing" position both in the front 
and in the rear, 
the passenger must not travel with 
a child on his lap.   

  -  

   Child safety

  CHILD SEAT IN THE FRONT 

  "Rearwards-facing" 
 Recommended on the rear seats up to 
the age of 2. 
 When a "rearwards-facing" child seat is 
installed on the front passenger seat, it 
is essential that the passenger airbag 
is deactivated. Otherwise, the child 
would risk being seriously injured or 
killed if the airbag were to inﬂ ate.  

  "Forwards-facing" 
 Recommended on the rear seats over 
the age of 2. 
 When a "forwards-facing" child seat is 
installed on the front passenger seat, 
leave the passenger airbag activated.   

  The child seats function and the 
passenger's airbag deativation function 
are common to the entire CITROËN 
range. 

  If the passenger's airbag is not 
deactivated, the installation of a 
"rearwards-facing" child seat in the 
front is strictly prohibited.  

  The rules for carrying children are 
speciﬁ c to each country. Consult the 
current legislation in your country. 
 Please consult the list of seats 
approved in your country. The Isoﬁ x 
mountings, the rear seats, the 
passenger airbag and the deactivation 
of this airbag depend on the version 
sold.  

  Refer to chapter 4, "Airbags" 
section.

 "ISOFIX" MOUNTINGS  
 These seats are ﬁ tted with ISOFIX 
mountings. 

 These are two rings located between 
the seat back and the seat cushion  . 
 The  ISOFIX child seats  are ﬁ tted with 
two locks which are secured easily on 
these rings. 

 This ISOFIX mounting system 
guarantees reliable, safe and fast 
ﬁ tting of the child seat in your vehicle.   

   Passenger airbag OFF  
  Refer to the advice given on the 
label present on both sides of the 
passenger's sun visor.  

  To assure the safety of your 
child, you must deactivate the 
passenger's front airbag when 

you install a child seat in the rearwards 
facing position on the front passenger's 
seat. 
 Otherwise, there is a risk that the child 
could be seriously injured or killed if 
the airbag were deployed.

   Child safety   
ADVIC
 The incorrect installation of a child seat 
in a vehicle compromises the child's 
protection in the event of an accident. 
 Remember to fasten the seat belts or 
the child seat harnesses  keeping the 
slack  in relation to the child's body  to a 
minimum , even for short journeys. 

 For optimum installation of the "forward 
facing" child seat, ensure that the back of 
the child seat is in contact with the back 
of the vehicle's seat and that the head 
restraint does not cause any discomfort. 

 If the head restraint has to be removed, 
ensure that it is stored or attached 
securely to prevent it from being 
thrown around the vehicle in the event 
of sharp braking. 
 Children under the age of 10 must not 
travel in the "forward facing" position 
on the front passenger seat, unless 
the rear seats are already occupied by 
other children, cannot be used or are 
absent. 

 Deactivate the passenger airbag when 
a "rear facing" child seat is installed on 
the front seat. 
 Otherwise, the child would risk being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag 
were to inﬂ ate. 

  As a safety precaution, do not leave: 
   -   one or more children alone and 

unsupervised in a vehicle, 

  -   a child or an animal in a vehicle 

which is exposed to the sun, with 
the windows closed, 
the keys within reach of children 
inside the vehicle.  

  -  

 To prevent accidental opening of the 
doors, use the "Child Lock". 

 Take care not to open the rear windows 
by more than one third. 

 To protect young children from the 
rays of the sun, ﬁ t side blinds to 
the rear windows.  

 CHILD MONITORING MIRROR 
 This mirror enables the driver or front 
passenger to observe all the rear 
seats. 
 Fitted on its own ball joint and able to 
retract into its housing in the roof, it 
provides a panoramic view of the rear 
interior of the vehicle. 

  Installing a booster seat 
 The chest part of the seat belt must 
be positioned on the child's shoulder 
without touching the neck. 
 Ensure that the lap part of the seat belt 
passes correctly over the child's thighs. 
 CITROËN recommends the use of a 
booster seat which has a back, ﬁ tted 
with a seat belt guide at shoulder level.  

   Towing a trailer

  Dimension A  = 0.96 m 

TOWING A TRAILER, CARAVAN, BOAT, ETC...

  Refer to the administrative 
documents (V5, ...) or to the Diesel 
"Dimensions, weights and towed 
loads" section of chapter 8. 

  Distribution of loads:  distribute the 
load in the trailer so that the heaviest 
loads are as close as possible to the 
axle and the nose weight is close 
to the maximum authorised without, 
however, exceeding it. 

  Cooling:  towing a trailer on a slope 
increases the coolant temperature. 
 As the fan is electrically controlled, its 
cooling capacity is not dependent on 
the engine speed. 

  Driving advice 
 A towed vehicle must free wheel: 
gearbox in neutral.

 On the contrary, use a high gear to 
lower the engine speed and reduce 
your speed. 
 In all cases, pay attention to the 
coolant temperature. 

 In certain cases of particularly 
arduous use (towing the 
maximum load up a steep slope 
in high temperatures), the engine 
automatically limits its power. In this 
case, cutting off the air conditioning 
allows the engine power to be 
recovered, and therefore the towing 
speed to be signiﬁ cantly increased 
(approximately 12 mph [20 km/h] 
more). Sequential control of the 
gearbox may also become unavailable. 

 If the coolant temperature warning light 
comes on, stop the vehicle and switch 
off the engine as soon as possible. 

  Tyres:  check the tyre pressures of 
the towing vehicle and of the trailer, 
observing the recommended pressure. 

 Refer to the "Identiﬁ cation 
features" section of chapter 8. 

  Brakes:  towing increases the braking 
distance. Drive at a moderate speed, 
change down early and brake 
gradually. 

 When using a trailer connection, 
you must add a fuse. Refer to 
the "Changing a fuse" section of 
chapter 7.      

  Side wind:  sensitivity to side wind is 
increased. Drive smoothly and at a 
moderate speed.      

  Towbar 
 We recommend the use of original 
CITROËN towbars, which have been 
tested for endurance from the design 
stage of your vehicle. 

 Towing equipment must be ﬁ tted in 
accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions, with particular attention to 
the towing capacities of your vehicle, 
the load towed, the nose weight and 
the electrical connection. As this ﬁ tting 
should be carried out by a professional, 
we recommend that you entrust the 
ﬁ tting of this equipment to a CITROËN 
dealer. 
 In accordance with the general 
instructions referred to above, we draw 
your attention to the risk connected 
with ﬁ tting a towbar or other electrical 
accessory which is not recommended 
by the CITROËN network. Fitting such 
equipment could result in a failure 
of your vehicle's electronic system. 
Please contact a CITROËN dealer ﬁ rst 
for further information. 

  Lighting 
  Manual adjustment 
 Adjust your headlamps so as not to 
dazzle other road users. Check the 
electrical signalling of the trailer. 

 Refer to the "Steering wheel 
controls" section of chapter 3.   

  Bicycle carrier 

 If you ﬁ t a bicycle carrier on 
the tailgate, deactivate the 
rear wiper from the display's 
conﬁ guration menu.  

   Automatic adjustment 
 For vehicles with Xenon bulbs, and if 
the change in load makes it necessary, 
this system automatically corrects the 
height of the beam after approximately 
2 minutes. The driver is then assured 
of having optimum lighting and not 
causing a nuisance to other road 
users.     

    Roof bars

 USING ROOF BARS 

 To use the transverse roof bars, 
release the four locking levers located 
at the base of the feet of each bar. 
 From the left-hand side, slide them 
in their rails to the required notch, 
supporting the foot of the bar with two 
hands to slide it correctly. 

 Lock the four locking levers. 

 For greater ease, it is recommended 
that two people carry out these 
operations. 
 When the roof bars are not in use, 
position them at the rear stop to avoid 
excess consumption. 
 Use accessories recommended by 
Automobiles CITROËN and follow 
the ﬁ tting instructions in the manual 
provided by the manufacturer of the 
load-carrying roof bars.  

  Maximum authorised weight on the 
roof rack: 220 lbs. (100 kg)   

  Removal and refitting of the 
roof bars 
   -   Remove the bolt, the stop and the 

two washers at each location  A . 
  -   Move the bars to the locations  A . 
  -   Lift the two bars to remove them. 
  -  

 Imperative:  reﬁ t the bolt, the 
stop and the two washers at each 
location  A .  

 To reﬁ t, proceed in the reverse order.

 LEVELS 

 These regular maintenance 
operations will keep your vehicle 
in good running order. Consult the 
instructions at CITROËN dealerships 
or in the servicing booklet enclosed in 
the handbook pack. 

 If you have to remove/reﬁ t the 
engine style cover, handle it with 
care to avoid damaging the ﬁ xing 
clips. 

  Oil level 
 Check the level regularly and top up 
between changes. The maximum 
consumption is 0.5 litre per 600 miles 
(1 000 km). 
 Check the level with the vehicle level, 
engine cold, using the dipstick. 

  Dipstick 

 There are two marks 
on the dipstick: 
  A  = maximum 
 If you ﬁ ll past this 
mark, contact a 
CITROËN dealer. 
  B  = minimum 
 Never allow the level 
to fall below this 
mark.

 To maintain the reliability of engines 
and emission control systems, the use 
of additives in engine oil is prohibited.   

  Oil change 
 It is imperative that this is carried out at 
the intervals speciﬁ ed and the viscosity 
grade of the oil selected must fulﬁ l the 
requirements in accordance with the 
manufacturer's servicing schedule. 
Consult the instructions at CITROËN 
dealerships. 
 Remove the dipstick before ﬁ lling. 
 Check the level after ﬁ lling (never 
exceed the max mark). 
 Screw the cap back onto the sump 
before closing the bonnet. 

  Viscosity selection 
 In all cases, the oil selected must meet 
the manufacturer's requirements.   

  Changing the brake fluid 
 The brake ﬂ uid must be changed at 
the intervals stated, according to the 
manufacturer's servicing schedule. 
 Use ﬂ uids recommended by the 
manufacturer, which fulﬁ l DOT4 
standards. 
 The level must be between the MIN 
and MAX marks on the reservoir. 
 If ﬂ uid has to be added frequently, 
this indicates a failure which must be 
checked by a CITROËN dealer as 
soon as possible.  

  Warning lights 

 Checking by means of the 
warning lights on the instrument 
panel is described in chapter 2, 
"Instruments and controls" section.

 Levels 
  Cooling system 
 Only use the ﬂ uid recommended by the 
manufacturer. 
 Otherwise, you risk seriously damaging 
your engine. 
 When the engine is warm, the 
temperature of the coolant is controlled 
by the engine fan. As this fan can 
operate with the ignition key removed 
and because the cooling system is 
pressurised, wait for at least one hour 
after the engine has stopped before 
carrying out any work. 
 Slacken the cap by 1/4 of a turn to 
release the pressure to prevent any 
risk of scalding. When the pressure 
has dropped, remove the cap and top 
up the level with coolant. 
 If ﬂ uid has to be added frequently, 
this indicates a failure which must be 
checked by a CITROËN dealer as 
soon as possible. 

  Topping up 
 The level must be between the MIN 
and MAX marks on the expansion 
bottle. If more than 1 litre of ﬂ uid is 
required to top up the level, have the 
system checked by a CITROËN dealer.   

  Power steering fluid level 
 The vehicle must be parked on level 
ground with the engine cold. Unscrew 
the cap integrated with the gauge and 
check the level which must be between 
the MIN and MAX marks.  
  Windscreen wash and headlamp 
wash level 
 For best quality cleaning and for your 
safety, we would advise that you use 
products of the CITROËN range. 
 To avoid ice forming, do not use water.  

  Diesel additive level (Diesel with 
particle emission filter) 

 The minimum level of this 
additive is indicated by 
lighting of the service warning 
light, accompanied by an 
audible signal and a message 
on the display. 

 When this occurs with the engine running, 
this is due to the start of saturation of 
the particle emission ﬁ lter (exceptionally 
prolonged urban driving conditions: low 
speed, long trafﬁ c jams, ...). 
 In order to regenerate the ﬁ lter, you are 
advised to drive at a speed of more than 
40 mph (60 km/h) as soon as possible, 
when trafﬁ c conditions permit, for at 
least ﬁ ve minutes (until the message 
disappears and the service warning light 
is switched off). 

 During regeneration of the particle 
emission ﬁ lter, relay noise may be 
heard under the fascia. 
 If the message is still displayed and 
the service warning light remains on, 
contact a CITROËN dealer. 

  Topping up 
 It is imperative that this additive is 
topped up by a CITROËN dealer 
without delay.   

  Used oil 
 Avoid prolonged contact of used oil 
with the skin. 
 Brake ﬂ uid is harmful to health and 
very corrosive. 
 Do not dispose of used oil, brake 
ﬂ uid or coolant into drains or onto 
the ground but into the containers 
dedicated to this use at CITROËN 
dealerships.  

  Carbon filter and passenger 
compartment filter 
 The carbon ﬁ lter permits continuous 
and effective ﬁ ltering of dust. 
 If the passenger compartment ﬁ lter 
becomes clogged, this may reduce 
the performance of the air conditioning 
system and generate unpleasant 
odours. 
 We recommend the use of a combined 
passenger compartment ﬁ lter. By 
means of its second special active 
ﬁ lter, it contributes to the puriﬁ cation 
of the air breathed by the occupants 
and to the cleanness of the passenger 
compartment (reduction of allergic 
symptoms, unpleasant odours and 
greasy deposits). 

 Refer to the servicing booklet to 
ﬁ nd out the replacement interval 
for these components. 
 Depending on the environment 
(dusty atmosphere...) and the use of 
the vehicle (urban driving...), change 
them twice as often if necessary. 
 Refer to the "Under the bonnet" section 
of chapter 6.  

 CHECKS
  Battery 
 At the start of winter, have your battery 
checked by a CITROËN dealer.  

  Brake pads 
 Brake pad wear depends on the style 
of driving, in particular for vehicles 
which are used in town, over short 
distances. It may be necessary to 
check the thickness of the pads, even 
between services. 
 Unless there is a leak on the circuit, a 
drop in the brake ﬂ uid level indicates 
that the brake pads are worn.  
  Brake disc/drum wear status 
 For any information relating to 
checking the brake disc/drum wear 
status, contact a CITROËN dealer.  

  Handbrake 
 Where the handbrake travel is too 
great or there is a reduction in the 
performance of the system, the 
handbrake should be adjusted, even 
between services. 
 Have the system checked by a 
CITROËN dealer.  
  Oil filter 
 Change the ﬁ lter regularly, in 
accordance with the servicing 
schedule.  

Checks
  Particle emission filter (Diesel) 
 It is imperative that particle emission 
ﬁ lter maintenance is carried out by a 
CITROËN dealer. 
 On acceleration after the vehicle has 
been running for a prolonged period 
at very low speed or at idle, you may, 
in exceptional circumstances, notice 
the emission of water vapour at the 
exhaust. This water vapour does not 
have any adverse effect on vehicle 
handling or the environment.  

  Manual gearbox 
 Have the level checked in accordance with 
the manufacturer's servicing schedule.  

 To check the main levels 
and certain components, 
in accordance with the 

manufacturer's servicing schedule, 
refer to the pages of the servicing 
booklet which correspond to your 
vehicle's engine. 

 Only use products recommended 
by CITROËN or products 
of equivalent quality and 
speciﬁ cation. 

 In order to optimise the operation 
of units as important as the braking 
system, CITROËN selects and offers 
speciﬁ c products. 
 In order to avoid damaging the 
electrical units, high pressure washing 
to clean the engine compartment is 
strictly prohibited.

  Special features of the 
automatic gearbox 
 When being towed with four wheels on 
the road, it is essential to observe the 
following rules: 
   -   selector lever in position  N , 
  -  

tow the vehicle at a speed below 
30 mph (50 km/h) over a distance 
limited to 30 miles (50 km) maximum, 

  -   do not add oil to the gearbox.  
 When towing with the engine switched 
off, there is no braking or steering 
assistance.  
  VEHICLES FITTED WITH A MANUAL 
GEARBOX (diesel version) 
 In the case of vehicles ﬁ tted with a 
manual gearbox, the gear lever must 
be in the neutral position. Failure to 
observe this special condition may 
result in damage to certain braking 
components and the absence of 
braking assistance the next time the 
engine is started.

  INFORMATION AND ADVICE

  The audio equipment will only play audio ﬁ les with ".wma, .aac, .ﬂ ac, 
.ogg and .mp3" ﬁ le extensions and with a bit rate of between 32 Kbps 
and 320 Kbps.
 It also supports VBR (Variable Bit Rate) mode.
 No other type of ﬁ le (.mp4, .m3u...) can be played.
 WMA ﬁ les must be of the standard wma 9 type.
 The sampling rates supported are 11, 22, 44 and 48 KHz.

  It is advisable to restrict ﬁ le names to 20 characters, without using of 
special characters (e.g.: " " ? ; ù) to avoid any playing and displaying
problems.

 The system supports USB mass storage or iPod
devices via the USB port (suitable cable not supplied). 
 If a partitioned USB memory key is connected to the 
system, only the ﬁ rst partition is recognised. 
 Control of the peripheral device is with the audio
system controls.
 The number of tracks is limited to 2000 maximum,
999 tracks per folder. 
 If the current consumption at the USB port exceeds 
500 mA, the system goes into protection mode and 
deactivates the port. 
 Other peripherals, not recognised on connection, must 
be connected to the auxiliary socket using a Jack cable 
(not supplied).  

  In order to be able to play a recorded CDR or CDRW, when recording 
it is preferable to select the ISO 9660 level 1, 2 or Joliet standard. 
 If the disc is recorded in another format it may not be played correctly. 
 It is recommended that the same recording standard is always used 
for an individual disc, with as low a speed as possible (4x maximum)
for optimum sound quality.
 In the particular case of a multi-session CD, the Joliet standard is
recommended.

 In order to be read, a USB memory stick must be formatted FAT 16 or 32.   

The system does not support the operation of an Apple ® player and a 
USB memory stick connected at the same time.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

The following table groups together the answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning your audio system. 

QUESTION

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 The route calculation is 
not successful. 

The guidance criteria may conﬂ ict with the current location (exclusion of 
toll roads on a toll motorway). 

 Check the guidance criteria on the Navigation 
Menu, "Guidance options"\ "Deﬁ ne calculation 
criteria". 

 The POIs do not appear. 

The POIs have not been selected.

 Select the POIs in the list of POIs. 

The POIs have not been downloaded. 

 The risk areas audible
warning does not work. 

The audible warning is not active. 

 Download the POIs from the website:   
"http://citroen.navigation.com".

 Activate audible warnings in the Guidance options 
menu, "Navigation - guidance", "Set parameters 
for risk areas". 

 The system does not
suggest a detour around 
an incident on the route. 

The guidance criteria do not take account of TMC messages. 

 Select the "Trafﬁ c info" function in the list of 
guidance criteria.

 I receive a Risk area alert
which is not on my route. 

Other than guidance, the system announces all Risk areas positioned in a 
cone located in front of the vehicle. It may provide an alert for a Risk area 
located on nearby or parallel roads.

 Zoom in on the map to view the exact position of 
the Risk area. Select "On the route" to no longer 
receive alerts other than guidance or to reduce the
time for the announcement.

9.54

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

QUESTION
 Certain trafﬁ c jams
along the route are not
indicated in real time.

ANSWER

SOLUTION

On starting, it is several minutes before the system begins to receive the
trafﬁ c information.

The ﬁ lters are too restrictive.

 Wait until the trafﬁ c information is being received 
correctly (display of the trafﬁ c information icons on
the map). 

 Modify the "Geographic ﬁ lter" settings. 

In certain countries, only major routes (motorways...) are listed for the
trafﬁ c information.

 This phenomenon is normal. The system is
dependent on the trafﬁ c information available.

 The altitude is not 
displayed. 

On starting, the initialisation of the GPS may take up to 3 minutes to
receive more than 4 satellites correctly.

Depending on the geographical environment (tunnel...) or the weather, 
the conditions of reception of the GPS signal may vary. 

 I cannot connect my
Bluetooth telephone.

The telephone's Bluetooth function may be switched off or the telephone
may not be visible.

 Wait until the system has started up completely. 
Check that there is a GPS coverage of at least
4 satellites (long press on the SETUP button, then 
select "GPS coverage"). 

 This phenomenon is normal. The system
is dependent on the GPS signal reception
conditions.  

  -   Check that your telephone's Bluetooth

function is switched on. 

  -   Check in the telephone settings that it is 

"visible to all".

 The volume of the
telephone connected
in Bluetooth mode is
inaudible. 

The Bluetooth telephone is not compatible with the system. 

The volume depends both on the system and on the telephone.

 A list of compatible Bluetooth mobile telephones is 
available from the dealer network.

 Increase the volume of the audio system, to
maximum if required, and increase the volume of 
the telephone if necessary.

The ambient noise level has an inﬂ uence on the quality of telephone 
communication. 

 Reduce the ambient noise level (close the windows,
reduce the booster fan speed, slow down, ...). 

9.55

QUESTION
 Some contacts are
duplicated in the list.

ANSWER

SOLUTION

The options for synchronizing contacts are synchronizing the contacts 
on the SIM card, the contacts on the telephone, or both. When both 
synchronizations are selected, some contacts may be duplicated.

 Select "Display SIM card contacts" or "Display
telephone contacts". 

 Contacts are not shown 
in alphabetical order.

Some telephones offer display options. Depending on the settings
chosen, contacts can be transferred in a speciﬁ c order.

 Modify the display setting in the telephone 
directory.

 The system does not
receive SMS text messages. 

The Bluetooth mode does not permit sending SMS text messages to the
system. 

 The CD is ejected 
automatically or is not 
played by the player. 

The CD is inserted upside down, is unplayable, does not contain any 
audio data or contains an audio format which the player cannot play. 

Le CD has been recorded in a format that is not compatible with the player.

The CD is protected by an anti-pirating protection system which is not 
recognised by the audio system. 

  -  

  -   Check that the CD is inserted in the player the 

right way up.

  -   Check the condition of the CD: the CD cannot 

be played if it is too damaged. 

  -   Check the content in the case of a recorded

CD: refer to the advice in the "AUDIO" section. 
The audio system's CD player does not play 
DVDs. 

  -   Some recorded CDs will not be played by 

the audio system because they are not of the
correct quality.  

 There is a long waiting 
period following the insertion 
of a CD or connection of a
USB memory stick.
 The CD player sound is
poor.

9.56

When a new medium is inserted, the system reads a certain amount of 
data (directory, title, artist, etc.). This may take from a few seconds to a
few minutes.

 This phenomenon is normal. 

The CD used is scratched or of poor quality.

The audio equipment settings (bass, treble, ambiences) are unsuitable.

 Insert good quality CDs and store them in suitable 
conditions. 

 Set the treble or bass level to 0, without selecting
an ambience. 

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

QUESTION

 Some characters in the
media information are not 
displayed correctly while 
playing. 

 Playing of streaming ﬁ les
does not start. 

 The names of tracks and 
the track length are not
displayed on the screen
when streaming audio. 

 The quality of reception
of the radio station 
listened to gradually
deteriorates or the stored 
stations do not function
(no sound, 87.5 Mhz is 
displayed...). 

 I cannot ﬁ nd some radio
stations in the list of 
stations received.

 The name of the radio 
station changes. 

The audio system does not display some types of characters.

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 Use standard characters to name tracks and
folders. 

The peripheral device connected does not support automatic play.

 Start the playback from the device. 

The Bluetooth proﬁ le does not allow the transfer of this information. 

The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station listened
to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area through which the 
vehicle is travelling. 

 Activate the "RDS" function by means of the
short-cut menu to enable the system to check 
whether there is a more powerful transmitter in the
geographical area.

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, basement car parks...) block 
reception, including in RDS mode.

 This phenomenon is normal and does not indicate 
a fault with the audio system. 

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going
through a car wash or into an underground car park). 

The station is not received or its name has changed in the list. 

Some radio stations send other information in place of their name (the 
title of the song for example).
The system interprets this information as the name of the station. 

 Have the aerial checked by a CITROËN dealer.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

The selection of an equalizer setting imposes the balance settings.
Modifying one without the other is not possible. 

 Modify the balance or equalizer settings to obtain
the desired musical ambience.

The selection of a distribution setting imposes the balance settings.
Modifying one without the other is not possible. 

 Modify the balance or distribution settings to 
obtain the desired musical ambience. 

QUESTION

 In changing the setting
of treble and bass the
equalizer setting is
deselected. 

 In changing the equalizer 
setting, treble and bass
return to zero. 

 When changing the 
balance settings, the 
distribution setting is 
deselected. 

 When changing an 
distribution setting, 
the balance setting is
deselected. 

 There is a difference in 
sound quality between
the different audio
sources (radio, CD...). 

For optimum sound quality, the audio settings for Volume, Bass, Treble,
Equalizer and Loudness can be adapted to the different sound sources,
which may result in audible differences when changing source (radio,
CD...). 

 Check that the audio settings for (Volume, Bass,
Treble, Equalizer, Loudness) are adapted to
the sources listened to. It is advisable to set the
AUDIO functions (Bass, Treble, Fr-Re balance,
Le-Ri balance) to the middle position, select the 
"None", musical ambience and set the loudness 
correction to the "Active" position in CD mode or 
to the "Inactive" position in radio mode.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

QUESTION

 With the engine off, the 
system switches off after 
a few minutes of use.

 Playback of my USB 
memory stick starts only 
after a very long wait 
(around 2 to 3 minutes).

 When I connect my
iPhone as telephone and 
to the USB port at the
same time, I am unable 
to play the music ﬁ les. 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

When the engine is switched off, the system's operating time depends on 
the battery charge. 
The switch-off is normal: the system switches to economy mode and 
switches off to prevent discharging of the vehicle's battery. 

 Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery
charge. 

Some ﬁ les supplied with the memory stick may greatly slow down access 
to reading the memory stick (multiplication by 10 of the catalogue time).

 Delete the ﬁ les supplied with the memory stick
and limit the number of sub-folders in the ﬁ le 
structure on the memory stick. 

When the iPhone connects automatically as a telephone, it forces the 
streaming function. The streaming function takes the place of the USB
function which is then not useable, there is a period without sound of the 
track being played with Apple®  players.

®

 Disconnect and reconnect to the USB port (the 
USB function takes priority over streaming).

MP3 CD 
INFORMATION AND ADVICE  

  Insert an MP3 compilation in the player.
 The audio equipment searches for all of the music tracks, which
may take anything between a few seconds and several tens of 
seconds, before play begins.
  On a single disc, the CD player can read up to 255 MP3 ﬁ les
spread over 8 folder levels. However, it is advisable to keep to 
a limit of two levels to reduce the access time before the CD is
played.
 While the CD is being played, the folder structure is not followed.

  Press the LIST REFRESH button to display the list of directories of 
the MP3 compilation.  

 The MP3 format, an abbreviation of MPEG 1.2 & 2.5 Audio Layer 3, 
is an audio compression standard which permits the recording of 
several tens of music ﬁ les on a single disc.  

 In order to be able to play a recorded CDR or CDRW, when 
recording, the ISO 9660 level 1.2 or Joliet ﬁ le format is
recommended. 
 If the disc is recorded in another format, it may not be played
correctly.
 It is recommended that the same recording format is always used 
for an individual disc, with as low a speed as possible
(4x maximum) for optimum sound quality. 
 In the particular case of a multi-session CD, the Joliet format is 
recommended.  

 The audio system will only play ﬁ les with the extension ".mp3" with
a sampling rate of 22.05 KHz or 44.1 KHz. No other type of ﬁ le
(.wma, .mp4, .m3u...) can be played.  

 It is advisable to restrict ﬁ le names to 20 characters without using
special characters (e.g. " ? ; ù) to avoid any playing or displaying 
problems.  

Press and hold one of the buttons for 
fast forward or backward play.

 Empty CDs are not recognised and may damage the system.

 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

QUESTION

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 There is a difference in 
sound quality between
the different audio
sources (radio, CD...). 

For optimum sound quality, the audio settings (Volume, Bass, Treble, 
Ambience, Loudness) can be adapted to the different sound sources,
which may result in audible differences when changing source (radio,
CD...). 

 The CD is ejected 
automatically or is not 
played by the player. 

The CD is inserted upside down, is unplayable, does not contain any 
audio data or contains an audio format which the player cannot play. 
The CD is protected by an anti-pirating protection system which is not 
recognised by the audio equipment. 

 Check that the audio settings (Volume, Bass, 
Treble, Ambience, Loudness) are adapted to
the sources listened to. It is advisable to set
the AUDIO functions (Bass, Treble, Front-Rear 
Balance, Left-Right Balance) to the middle 
position, select the musical ambience "None" and 
set the loudness correction to the "Active" position 
in CD mode or to the "Inactive" position in radio 
mode. 
  -   Check that the CD is inserted in the player the 

right way up.

  -   Check the condition of the CD: the CD cannot 

be played if it is too damaged. 

  -   Check the content in the case of a recorded
CD: consult the advice in the "Audio" section.
The audio equipment's CD player does not
play DVDs.

  -  

  -   Due to their quality level, certain writeable

CDs will not be played by the audio system.

 The message "USB 
peripheral error" is
displayed on the screen.
 The Bluetooth connection
is cut. 

 The CD player sound is
poor.

The battery of the peripheral may not be sufﬁ ciently charged.

 Recharge the battery of the peripheral device. 

The USB memory stick is not recognised. 
The memory stick may be corrupt. 
The CD used is scratched or of poor quality.

The audio equipment settings (bass, treble, ambiences) are unsuitable.

 Reformat the memory stick. 

 Insert good quality CDs and store them in suitable 
conditions. 

 Set the treble or bass level to 0, without selecting
an ambience. 

9.81

QUESTION

 The stored stations do
not function (no sound, 
87.5 Mhz is displayed...). 

 The trafﬁ c announcement
(TA) is displayed. I do
not receive any trafﬁ c 
information.

 The quality of reception
of the radio station 
listened to gradually
deteriorates or the stored 
stations do not function
(no sound, 87.5 Mhz is 
displayed...). 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 An incorrect waveband is selected.

 Press the BAND AST button to return to the 
waveband (AM, FM1, FM2, FMAST) on which the
stations are stored. 

The radio station is not part of the regional trafﬁ c information network.

 Tune to a radio station which broadcasts trafﬁ c 
information.

The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station listened
to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area through which the 
vehicle is travelling. 
The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, basement car parks...) block 
reception, including in RDS mode.

 Activate the RDS function to enable the system 
to check whether there is a more powerful 
transmitter in the geographical area.
 This phenomenon is normal and does not indicate 
a failure of the audio equipment.

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going
through a car wash or into an underground car park). 

 Have the aerial checked by a CITROËN dealer.

 Sound cut-outs of 1 to
2 seconds in radio mode.

During this brief sound cut-out, the RDS searches for any frequency 
permitting better reception of the station. 

 Deactivate the RDS function if the phenomenon is 
too frequent and always on the same route.

 With the engine off, 
the audio equipment 
switches off after a few 
minutes of use. 

When the engine is switched off, the audio equipment operating time
depends on the battery charge. 
The switch-off is normal: the audio equipment switches to economy mode 
and switches off to prevent discharging of the vehicle's battery. 

 Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery
charge. 

 The message "the audio 
system is overheated" 
appears on the display. 

In order to protect the installation if the surrounding temperature is too
high, the audio equipment switches to an automatic thermal protection
mode leading to a reduction of the volume or stopping of the playing of 
the CD.

 Switch the audio system off for a few minutes to
allow the system to cool.

ECO-DRIVING
 Eco-driving is a range of everyday practices that allow the motorist to optimise their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. 

  Optimise the use of your gearbox 

  Control the use of your electrical equipment 

  With a manual gearbox, move off gently, change up without 
waiting and drive by changing up quite soon. If your vehicle 
has  the  system,  the  gear  shift  indicator  invites  you  to 
change up; it is displayed in the instrument panel, follow its 
instructions.  

  With an automatic or electronic gearbox, stay in Drive  "D"  or 
Auto  "A" , according to the type of gearbox, without pressing 
the accelerator pedal heavily or suddenly.   

  Drive smoothly 

  Maintain a safe distance between vehicles, use engine braking 
rather  than  the  brake  pedal,  and  press  the  accelerator  pro-
gressively. These practices contribute towards a reduction in 
fuel consumption and CO2 emissions and also helps reduce 
the background trafﬁ c noise.  

  If your vehicle has cruise control, make use of the system at 
speeds above 25 mph (40 km/h) when the trafﬁ c is ﬂ owing 
well.   

  Before  moving  off,  if  the  passenger  compartment  is  too 
warm,  ventilate  it  by  opening  the  windows  and  air  vents 
before using the air conditioning. 
 Above 30 mph (50 km/h), close the windows and leave the 
air vents open. 
 Remember to make use of equipment that can help keep the 
temperature in the passenger compartment down (sunroof 
and window blinds...). 
 Switch off the air conditioning, unless it has automatic digital 
regulation, as soon as the desired temperature is attained. 
 Switch  off  the  demisting  and  defrosting  controls,  if  not 
automatic. 
 Switch off the heated seat as soon as possible.  

  Switch off the headlamps and front foglamps when the level 
of light does not require their use.  

  Avoid running the engine before moving off, particularly in 
winter; your vehicle will warm up much faster while driving.  

  As  a  passenger,  if  you  avoid  connecting  your  multimedia 
devices  (ﬁ lm,  music,  video  game...),  you  will  contribute 
towards  limiting  the  consumption  of  electrical  energy,  and 
so of fuel. 
 Disconnect your portable devices before leaving the vehicle.   

    Environment    

5

  Limit the causes of excess consumption 

  Observe the recommendations on maintenance 

  Spread  loads  throughout  the  vehicle;  place  the  heaviest 
items in the bottom of the boot, as close as possible to the 
rear seats. 
 Limit  the  loads  carried  in  the  vehicle  and  reduce  wind 
resistance  (roof  bars,  roof  rack,  bicycle  carrier,  trailer...). 
Use a roof box in preference. 
 Remove roof bars and roof racks after use.  

  At  the  end  of  winter,  remove  snow  tyres  and  reﬁ t  your 
summer tyres.   

  Check the tyre pressures regularly, when cold, referring to 
the label in the door aperture, driver's side. 
 Carry out this check in particular: 
   -   before a long journey, 
  -   at each change of season, 
  -   after a long period out of use.  
 Don't forget the spare wheel and the tyres on any trailer or 
caravan.  

  Have  your  vehicle  serviced  regularly  (engine  oil,  oil  ﬁ lter, 
air ﬁ lter...) and observe the schedule of operations recom-
mended by the manufacturer.    

  When refuelling, do not continue after the third cut-off of the 
nozzle to avoid any overﬂ ow.  

  At  the  wheel  of  your  new  vehicle,  it  is  only  after  the  ﬁ rst 
1 800 miles  (3 000 kilometres)  that  you  will  see  the  fuel 
consumption settle down to a consistent average.
