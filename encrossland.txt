considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Note
Only use protective seat covers that
have been approved for the vehicle.
Be careful not to cover the airbags.
Curtain airbag system
The curtain airbag system consists of
an airbag in the roof frame on each
side. This can be identified by the
word AIRBAG on the roof pillars.
The curtain airbag system is triggered
in the event of a side-on impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the head in the event of a
side-on impact considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
The hooks on the handles in the
roof frame are only suitable for
hanging up light articles of
clothing, without coat hangers. Do
not keep any items in these
clothes.

Airbag deactivation
The front passenger airbag system
must be deactivated for child restraint
system on the passenger seat
according to the instructions in the
table 3 61. The side airbag and
curtain airbag systems, the belt
pretensioners and all driver airbag
systems will remain active.

The front passenger airbag system
can be deactivated via a key-
operated switch on the passenger
side of the instrument panel.

Seats, restraints

57

Use the ignition key to choose the
position:
*OFF : front passenger airbag is
deactivated and will not
inflate in the event of a
collision. Control indicator
*OFF illuminates
continuously in the centre
console

ÓON : front passenger airbag is

active

9 Danger

Deactivate passenger airbag only
in combination with the use of a
child restraint system, subject to
the instructions and restrictions in
the table 3 61.
Otherwise, there is a risk of fatal
injury for a person occupying a
seat with a deactivated front
passenger airbag.

If the control indicator ÓON
illuminates for approx. 60 seconds
after the ignition is switched on, the
front passenger airbag system will
inflate in the event of a collision.
If the control indicator *OFF
illuminates after the ignition is
switched on, the front passenger
airbag system is deactivated. It stays
on while the airbag is deactivated.
If both control indicators are
illuminated at the same time, there is
a system failure. The status of the
system is not discernible, therefore
no person is allowed to occupy the
front passenger seat. Contact a
workshop immediately.

Seats, restraints

58
Consult a workshop immediately if
neither of the two control indicators
are illuminated.
Change status only when the vehicle
is stopped with the ignition off.
Status remains until the next change.

9 Danger

If using a rear-facing child restraint
system on the front passenger
seat, the airbag system for the
front passenger seat must be
deactivated. This also applies to
certain forward-facing child
restraint systems as indicated in
the tables 3 61.

Airbag deactivation 3 57.
Airbag label 3 52.
We recommend a child restraint
system which is tailored specifically to
the vehicle. For further information,
contact your workshop.
When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.

Fasten vehicle-approved ISOFIX
child restraint systems to the ISOFIX
brackets. Specific vehicle ISOFIX
child restraint system positions are
marked in the ISOFIX table 3 61.
ISOFIX brackets are indicated by a
label on the backrest.
An i-size child restraint system is an
universal ISOFIX child restraint
system according UN Regulation No.
129.
All i-size child restraint systems can
be used on any vehicle seat suitable
for i-size, i-size table 3 61.
Either a Top-tether strap or a support
leg must be used in addition to the
ISOFIX brackets.

i-size child seats and vehicle seats
with i-size approval are marked with
i-size symbol, see illustration.

Top-tether anchors
Top-tether anchors are marked with
the symbol : for a child seat.

In addition to the ISOFIX brackets,
fasten the Top-tether strap to the
Top-tether anchors.
ISOFIX child restraint systems of
universal category positions are
marked in the table by IUF 3 61.
Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.

Seats, restraints

59

Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This makes sure that the
child's backbone, which is still very
weak, is under less strain in the event
of an accident.
Suitable are restraint systems that
comply with valid UN ECE
regulations. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.
The following child restraints are
recommended for the following
weight classes:
● Maxi Cosi Cabriofix for group 0,

group 0+

● Duo Plus for group I
● Kidfix XP for group II/III
● Graco Junior for group III
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct, see following
tables.

Seats, restraints

60
Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.
When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.
Note
Do not affix anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.
A child restraint system which has
been subjected to stress in an
accident must be replaced.

Pressing LPG switches between
petrol and liquid gas operation as
soon as the required parameters
(coolant temperature, gas
temperature and minimum engine
speed) have been reached. The
requirements are usually fulfilled after

Every six months, run the petrol tank
down until control indicator Y
illuminates, then refuel. This helps
maintain fuel quality and system
function for petrol operation.
Fill the tank completely at regular
intervals to prevent corrosion in the
tank.
Faults and remedies
If gas mode is not possible, check the
following:
● Is there enough liquid gas

present?

● Is there enough petrol present for

starting?

Due to extreme temperatures in
combination with the gas
composition, it may take slightly
longer before the system switches
from petrol to gas mode.
In extreme situations, the system may
also switch back to petrol mode if the
minimum requirements are not
fulfilled. If conditions allow, it may be
possible to manually switch back to
liquid gas operation.

Seek the assistance of a workshop in
the event of all other faults.

Caution

Repairs and adjustments may only
be made by trained specialists in
order to maintain the safety and
warranty on the LPG system.

Liquid gas is given a particular odour
(odorised) so that any leaks can be
detected easily.

9 Warning

If you smell gas in the vehicle or in
the immediate vicinity, switch to
petrol mode immediately. No
smoking. No naked flames or
ignition sources.

If the gas odour persists, do not start
the engine. Have the cause of the
fault remedied by a workshop.
When using underground car parks,
follow the instructions of the operator
and local laws.

9 Warning

This emergency operation may
only be carried out in case of
extremely cold temperatures and if
the vehicle is parked on a level
surface.

In countries with extreme cold
temperatures it may be necessary to
park the vehicle without applied
parking brake.
This is an emergency operation to
avoid freezing of the parking brake.

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
Automatic cleaning process
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases.
The start of saturation of the particle
filter is indicated by the temporary
illumination of % or H,
accompanied by a message in the
Driver Information Centre.

As soon as the traffic conditions
permit, regenerate the filter by driving
at a vehicle speed of at least 60 km/h
until the control indicator
extinguishes.
Note
On a new vehicle, the first particle
filter regeneration operations may
be accompanied by a burning smell,
which is normal. Following
prolonged operation of the vehicle at
very low speed or at idle, you may,
in exceptional circumstances, notice
the emission of water vapour at the
exhaust on acceleration. This does
not affect the behaviour of the
vehicle or the environment.
Cleaning process not possible
If % or H stays on, accompanied
by an audible signal and a message,
this indicates that the particle filter
additive level is too low.
The reservoir must be topped-up
without delay. Seek the assistance of
a workshop.

141

Driving and operating
Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the
amount of harmful substances in the
exhaust gases.

Caution

Fuel grades other than those listed
on pages 3 177, 3 233 could
damage the catalytic converter or
electronic components.
Unburnt petrol will overheat and
damage the catalytic converter.
Therefore avoid excessive use of
the starter, running the fuel tank
dry and starting the engine by
pushing or towing.

In the event of misfiring, uneven
engine running, a reduction in engine
performance or other unusual
problems, have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop as soon as
possible. In an emergency, driving
can be continued for a short period,
keeping vehicle speed and engine
speed low.

Driving and operating

142
AdBlue
General information
The selective catalytic reduction
(BlueInjection) is a method to
substantially reduce the nitrogen
oxides in the exhaust emission. This
is achieved by injecting a Diesel
Exhaust Fluid (DEF) into the exhaust
system. The ammonia released by
the fluid reacts with nitrous gases
(NOx) from the exhaust and turns it
into nitrogen and water.
The designation of this fluid is
AdBlue®. It is a non-toxic, non-
flammable, colourless and odourless
fluid which consists of 32% urea and
68% water.

9 Warning

Avoid contact of your eyes or skin
with AdBlue.
In case of eye or skin contact,
rinse off with water.

Caution

Avoid contact of the paintwork with
AdBlue.
In case of contact, rinse off with
water.

AdBlue freezes at a temperature of
approx. -11 °C. As the vehicle is
equipped with an AdBlue pre-heater,
the emissions reduction at low
temperatures is ensured. The AdBlue
pre-heater works automatically.
Level warnings
The AdBlue consumption is
approximately 0.7 litres per 1000 km.
The consumption can be higher
depending on driving behaviour (e.g.
high load or towing).
Depending on the calculated range of
AdBlue, different messages are
displayed in the Driver Information
Centre. The messages and the
restrictions are a legal requirement.

The first possible warning message
appears at an AdBlue range below
2400 km, shows up at each start and
each 300 km range reduction:
Top up AdBlue: Starting impossible in
2400 km
Additionally, control indicator Y
illuminates continuously and a chime
sounds with every message pop-up.
At an AdBlue range below 600 km,
the following warning message is
being displayed, shows up at each
start and each 20 km range reduction:
Top up AdBlue: Starting impossible in
600 km
Additionally, control indicator Y
flashes continuously and a chime
sounds with every message pop-up.
Note
In case of high AdBlue consumption,
the Driver Information Centre may
display this warning without the
previous warning stages.
The last warning level is entered
when the AdBlue tank is empty.
Restart of the engine is not possible.

The following warning message is
being displayed and cannot be
dismissed:
Top up AdBlue: Starting impossible
Additionally, control indicator Y
flashes continuously and engine
cannot be restarted until AdBlue tank
is being filled with at least 5 litres.
High emission warnings
If the exhaust emission rises above a
certain value, warnings similar to the
range warnings will be displayed in
the Driver Information Centre.
Requests to have the exhaust system
checked and finally the
announcement of the prevention of
an engine restart are displayed.
These restrictions are a legal
requirement.
Consult a workshop for assistance.

Refilling AdBlue

Caution

Only use AdBlue that complies
with European standards
DIN 70 070 and ISO 22241-1.
Do not use additives.
Do not dilute AdBlue.
Otherwise the selective catalytic
reduction system could be
damaged.

Note
Whenever a filling pump with a
nozzle for passenger cars is not
available at a filling station, use only
AdBlue bottles or canisters with a
sealed refill adapter for refilling, to
prevent splashback and overspill,
and in order to ensure that the fumes
from the tank are captured and do
not emerge. AdBlue in bottles or
canisters is available in many filling
stations and can be purchased e.g.
at Opel dealers and other retail
outlets.

143

Driving and operating
Since AdBlue has a limited
durability, check the date of expiry
before refilling.
Note
When AdBlue-tank is empty, refill at
least five litresto ensure that the new
AdBlue level is being detected.
In case AdBlue refill is not
successfully detected:
1. Continuously drive the vehicle

for ten minutes making sure that
vehicle speed is always higher
than 20 km/h.

2. If AdBlue refill is detected

successfully, AdBlue supply-
driven warnings or limitations will
disappear.

If AdBlue refill is still not detected,
seek the assistance of a workshop.
If AdBlue must be refilled at
temperatures below -11 °C, the
refilling of AdBlue may not be
detected by the system. In this
event, park the vehicle in a space
with a higher ambient temperature
until AdBlue is liquified.

9. Unscrew the hose from the filler

neck.

10. Mount the protective cap and turn

clockwise until it engages.

Note
Dispose of AdBlue canister
according to environmental
requirements. Hose can be reused

Gear shift indication 3 93.
Stop-start system 3 138.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing the journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
Control indicator R 3 92.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.

ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
When braking in an emergency, the
hazard warning flashers are switched
on automatically depending on the
force of deceleration. They are
switched off automatically the first
time you accelerate.
After starting off, the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.

Control indicator u 3 92.

Fault

149

9 Warning

If there is a fault in the ABS, the
wheels may be liable to lock due
to braking that is heavier than
normal. The advantages of ABS
are no longer available. During
hard braking, the vehicle can no
longer be steered and may
swerve.

Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

release button and fully lower the
lever.
To reduce the operating forces of
the parking brake, depress the
foot brake at the same time.

Control indicator R 3 92.

Brake assist
If brake pedal is depressed quickly
and forcefully, maximum brake force
is automatically applied.
Operation of brake assist might
become apparent by a pulse in the
brake pedal and a greater resistance
when depressing the brake pedal.
Maintain steady pressure on the
brake pedal as long as full braking is
required. Maximum brake force is
automatically reduced when brake
pedal is released.

Hill start assist
The system helps prevent unintended
movement when driving away on
inclines.
When releasing the brake pedal after
stopping on an incline, brakes remain
on for further two seconds. The
brakes release automatically as soon
as the vehicle begins to accelerate.

Ride control systems
Electronic Stability Control
and Traction Control system
Electronic Stability Control improves
driving stability when necessary,
regardless of the type of road surface
or tyre grip.
As soon as the vehicle starts to
swerve (understeer/oversteer),
engine output is reduced and the
wheels are braked individually.
Electronic Stability Control operates
in combination with the Traction
Control system. It prevents the driven
wheels from spinning.
The Traction Control system is a
component of the Electronic Stability
Control.
Traction Control improves driving
stability when necessary, regardless
of the type of road surface or tyre grip,
by preventing the driven wheels from
spinning.
As soon as the driven wheels starts to
spin, engine output is reduced and
the wheel spinning the most is braked

individually. This considerably
improves the driving stability of the
vehicle on slippery road surfaces.

Forward collision alert
The forward collision alert may help to
avoid or reduce the harm caused by
front-end crashes.
The forward collision alert uses the
front camera in the windscreen to
detect a vehicle directly ahead, in
your path.
The system triggers different level of
alerts depending on the risk of
collision detected. The alerts are
displayed in the Driver Information
Centre.
Level 1: A visual alert is displayed.
Level 2: A visual alert is displayed and
an audible alert sounds.

Caution

The colour lighting of this control
indicator does not correspond to
local traffic laws on following
distance. The driver bears full

responsibility for maintaining safe
following distance according to
applicable traffic rules, weather
and road conditions etc. at all
times.

9 Warning

Forward collision alert is just a
warning system and does not
apply the brakes. When
approaching a vehicle ahead too
rapidly, it may not provide you
enough time to avoid a collision.
The driver accepts full
responsibility for the appropriate
following distance based on traffic,
weather and visibility conditions.
The complete attention of the
driver is always required while
driving. The driver must always be
ready to take action and apply the
brakes.

When the time to a potential collision
with a vehicle in front gets too small
and a collision is imminent, a warning
is displayed in the Driver Information
Centre.
Simultaneously a warning chime
sounds. Depress the brake pedal and
steer the vehicle, if it is required by the
situation.
Operation conditions
The following condition must be
fullfilled for proper operation:
The speed must be between 5 km/h
and 140 km/h.
Activation
To use forward colision alert, active
safety braking has to be activated in
the vehicle personalisation 3 103.
Selecting the alert sensitivity
The alert sensitivity has to be set to
close, normal or distant in the vehicle
personalisation menu 3 103.

Deactivation
The system can only be deactivated
by deactivating the active emergency
braking in the vehicle personalisation
3 103.
System limitations
Forward collision alert is designed to
warn on vehicles only, but may react
also to other objects.
In the following cases, forward
collision alert may not detect a vehicle
ahead or sensor performance is
limited:
● Driving on winding or hilly roads.
● During nighttime driving.
● Weather limits visibility, such as

fog, rain, or snow

● The windscreen is damaged or
affected by foreign items, e.g.
stickers.

Active emergency braking
Active emergency braking can help to
reduce the damage and injury from
crashes with vehicles, pedestrians
and obstacles directly ahead, when a

157

Driving and operating
collision can no longer be avoided
either by manual braking or by
steering. Before the active
emergency braking applies, the driver
is warned by the forward collision
alert 3 156 or the front pedestrian
protection alert 3 159.
The feature uses various inputs (e.g.
camera sensor, brake pressure,
vehicle speed) to calculate the
probability of a frontal collision.

9 Warning

This system is not intended to
replace the driver responsibility for
driving the vehicle and looking
ahead. Its function is limited to
supplemental use only to reduce
the vehicle speed before a
collision.
The system may not react to
animals. After a sudden lane
change, the system needs a
certain time to detect the next
preceding vehicle.
The driver must always be ready
to take action and apply the brakes
and steer to avoid collisions.

Driving and operating

158
Operation conditions
Active emergency braking is
equipped with a front camera and
operates in forward gear above
walking speed up to 85 km/h.
Activation
Active emergency braking can be
activated in the vehicle
personalisation menu 3 103.
Functionality
The system includes:
● brake preparation system
● emergency automatic braking
● forward looking brake assist
● forward collision alert
● front pedestrian protection
Brake preparation system
When approaching a vehicle ahead
or a pedestrian so quickly that a
collision is likely, the brake
preparation system slightly
pressurizes the brakes. This reduces
the response time, when a manual or
automatic braking is requested.

The brake system is prepared so that
braking can occur more rapidly.
Emergency automatic braking
After activation of brake preparation
system and just before the imminent
collision, this function automatically
applies limited braking to reduce the
impact speed of the collision or
prohibit a crash. Depending on the
situation, the vehicle may
automatically brake moderately or
hard. This front automatic braking can
only occur if a vehicle 3 156 or a
pedestrian 3 159 ahead is detected .
Emergency automatic braking may
slow the vehicle to a complete stop to
try to avoid a potential crash.

9 Warning

Emergency automatic braking is
an emergency crash preparation
feature and is not designed to
avoid crashes. Do not rely on the
system to brake the vehicle.
Emergency automatic braking will
not brake outside of its operating

speed range and only responds to
detected vehicles and
pedestrians.

Forward looking brake assist
In addition to the brake preparation
system and emergency automatic
braking, the forward looking brake
assist function makes the brake assist
more sensitive. Therefore, pressing
the brake pedal less strongly results
in immediate hard braking. This
function helps the driver brake
quicker and harder before the
imminent collision.

9 Warning

Active emergency braking is not
designed to apply hard
autonomous braking or to
automatically avoid a collision. It is
designed to reduce the vehicle
speed before a collision. It may not
react to animals. After a sudden

lane change, the system needs a
certain time to detect the next
preceding vehicle.
The complete attention of the
driver is always required while
driving. The driver must always be
ready to take action and apply the
brakes and steer to avoid
collisions.

The system is designed to work with
all occupants wearing their seat belts.

System limitations
In some cases, the active emergency
braking system may provide an
automatic braking in situations that
seem to be unnecessary, for instance
in parking garages, due to traffic signs
in a curve or due to vehicles in
another lane. This is normal
operation, the vehicle does not need
service. Firmly apply the accelerator
pedal to override the automatic
braking if the situation and the
surroundings permit.
In the following cases, active
emergency braking performance is
limited:
● Driving on winding or hilly roads.
● Detecting all vehicles, especially

vehicles with a trailer, tractors,
muddy vehicles, etc.

● Detecting a vehicle when

weather limits visibility, such as in

Driver alert
The driver alert system monitores the
driving time and the vigilance of the
driver. Monitoring the vigilance of the
driver is based on the trajectory
variations of the vehicle compared to
the lane markings.
The system includes a driving time
alert combined with driver drowsiness
detection.

9 Warning

The system cannot replace the
need for vigilance on the part of
the driver. It is recommended that
you take a break as soon as you
feel tired or at least every two
hours. Do not take the wheel if you
are tired.

Activation or Deactivation
The system can be activated or
deactivated in the vehicle
personalisation 3 103
The state of the system stays in
memory when the ignition is switched
off.

Driving time alert
The driver gets notified by a pop-up
reminder symbol € in the Driver
Information Centre simultaneously
with a acoustic alert if the driver has
not taken a break after two hours of
driving at a speed above 65 km/h. The
alert is repeated hourly until the
vehicle is stopped, no matter how
vehicle speed evolves.
The counting of driving time alert is
reset when the ignition has been
switched off for a few minutes.
Driver drowsiness detection
The system monitors the driver's level
of vigilance. A camera at the top of the
windscreen detects variations in
trajectory compared to the lane
markings. This system is particularly
suited to fast roads (speed higher
than 65 km/h).
If the trajectory of the vehicle
suggests a certain level of
drowsiness or inattention by the
driver, the system triggers the first

level of alert. The driver is notified by
a message and an audible signal is
given.
After three first level alerts, the
system triggers a new alert with a
message, accompanied by a more
pronounced audible signal.
In certain driving conditions (poor
road surface or strong winds), the
system may give alerts independent
of the driver's level of vigilance.
The driver drowsiness detection is
reinitialised when the ignition has
been switched off for a few minutes or
the speed remains below 65 km/h for
a few minutes.
System limitations
In the following situations, the system
may not operate properly or even not
operate at all:
● Poor visibility caused by
inadequate lighting of the
roadway, falling snow, heavy
rain, dense fog etc.

● Dazzle caused by headlamps of
an oncoming vehicles, low sun,
reflections on damp roads,
leaving a tunnel, alternating
shade and light etc.

● Windscreen area in front of the
camera covered by dirt, snow,
stickers etc.

● No lane markings detected or
multiple lane markings due to
roadworks

● Close vehicles ahead
● Winding roads or narrow roads

Fuel
Fuel for petrol engines
Only use unleaded fuel that complies
with European standard EN 228 or
E DIN 51626-1 or equivalent.
The engine is capable of running with
fuel that contains up to 10% ethanol
(e.g. named E10).
Use fuel with the recommended
octane rating. A lower octane rating
can reduce engine power and torque
and slightly increases fuel
consumption.

Caution

Do not use fuel or fuel additives
that contain metallic compounds
such as manganese-based
additives. This may cause engine
damage.

Driving and operating

177

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 228 or E DIN 51626-1 or
equivalent can lead to deposits or
engine damage.

Caution

Use of fuel with a lower octane
rating than the lowest possible
rating could lead to uncontrolled
combustion and engine damage.

The engine specific requirements
regarding octane rating are given in
the engine data overview 3 233. A
country-specific label at the fuel filler
flap can supersede the requirement.
Fuel additives outside Europe
Fuel should contain detergent
additives that help prevent engine
and fuel system deposits from
forming. Clean fuel injectors and
intake valves will allow the emission
control system to work properly.

Driving and operating
178
Some fuel does not contain sufficient
quantities of additive to keep fuel
injectors and intake valves clean.
To make up for this lack of
detergency, add Fuel System
Treatment PLUS to the fuel tank at
every engine oil change or every
10,000 km, whichever occurs first. It
is available at your workshop.
Fuels containing oxygenates such as
ethers and ethanol, as well as
reformulated fuel, are available in
some cities. If these fuels comply with
the previously described
specification, then they are
acceptable to use. However, E85
(85% ethanol) and other fuels
containing more than 15% ethanol
must be used only in FlexFuel
vehicles.

Caution

Do not use fuel containing
methanol. It can corrode metal
parts in the fuel system and also
damage plastic and rubber parts.
This damage would not be
covered by the vehicle warranty.

Some fuels, mainly high octane
racing fuels, can contain an octane
enhancing additive called
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese
tricarbonyl (MMT). Do not use fuels or
fuel additives with MMT as they can
reduce spark plug life and affect
emission control system
performance. The malfunction
indicator light Z may turn on 3 91. If
this occurs, seek the assistance of a
workshop.

Fuel for diesel engines
Only use diesel fuel that complies
with EN 590.
In countries outside the European
Union use Euro-Diesel fuel with a
sulfur concentration below 50 ppm.

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 590 or similar can lead to
engine powerloss, increased wear
or engine damage.

Do not use marine diesel oils, heating
oils, Aquazole and similar diesel-
water emulsions. Diesel fuels must
not be diluted with fuels for petrol
engines.
Low temperature operation
At temperatures below 0° C, some
diesel products with biodiesel blends
may clog, freeze or gel, which may
affect the fuel supply system. Starting
and engine operation may not work
properly. Make sure to fill winter
grade diesel fuel at ambient
temperatures below 0° C.
Arctic grade diesel fuel can be used
in extreme cold temperatures below
-20° C. Using this fuel grade in warm
or hot climates is not recommended
and may cause engine stalling, poor
starting or damage on the fuel
injection system.

Fuel for liquid gas operation
Liquid gas is known as LPG
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas) or under
its French name GPL (Gaz de Pétrole
Liquéfié). LPG is also known as
Autogas.

LPG consists mainly of propane and
butane. The octane rating is between
105 and 115, depending on the
butane proportion. LPG is stored as a
liquid at a pressure of approximately
five to ten bar.
The boiling point depends on the
pressure and the mixing ratio. At
ambient pressure, it is between
-42 °C (pure propane) and -0.5 °C
(pure butane).

Caution

The system works at an ambient
temperature of approx. -8 °C to
100 °C.

Full functioning of the LPG system
can only be guaranteed with liquid
gas which complies with the minimum
requirements of DIN EN 589.

9 Danger

Before refuelling, switch off
ignition and any external heaters
with combustion chambers.
Follow the operating and safety
instructions of the filling station
when refuelling.

Driving and operating

179

9 Danger

Fuel is flammable and explosive.
No smoking. No naked flames or
sparks.
If you can smell fuel in your
vehicle, have the cause of this
remedied immediately by a
workshop.

Caution

In case of misfuelling, do not
switch on ignition.

Fuel filler flap is located at left rear

Close the flap and allow it to engage.

Trailer hitch
General information
The factory-fitted towing equipment is
folded up under the rear bumper
fascia.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment. Only use
towing equipment that has been
approved for your vehicle.
To avoid vehicle damage, the power
tailgate cannot be operated with the
radio remote control when a trailer is
electrically connected.
The bulb outage detection function for
trailer brake light cannot detect a
partial bulb outage, e.g. in case of four
times five watt bulbs, the function only
detects lamp outage when only a
single five Watt lamp remains or none
remain.
Fitting of towing equipment could
cover the opening of the towing eye.
If this is the case use the coupling ball
bar for towing.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements.
During trailer towing do not exceed a
speed of 80 km/h. A maximum speed
of 100 km/h is only appropriate if an
oscillation damper is used and the
permissible gross trailer weight does
not exceed the vehicle’s curb weight.
For trailers with low driving stability
and caravan trailers, the use of an
oscillation damper is strongly
recommended.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 239.

181

Driving and operating
Trailer towing
Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to 12%.
The permissible trailer load applies
up to the specified incline and at sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10%
for every 1000 metres of altitude. The
gross train weight does not have to be
reduced when driving on roads with
slight inclines (less than 8%, e.g.
motorways).

Driving and operating

182
The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 228.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load of 60 kg is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.

Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) may be exceeded by
60 kg, the gross vehicle weight rating
must not be exceeded. If the
permissible rear axle load is
exceeded, a maximum speed of
100 km/h applies.

Towing equipment
Caution

When operating without a trailer,
remove the coupling ball bar.

Stowage of coupling ball bar

Accessories and vehicle
modifications
We recommend the use of genuine
parts and accessories and factory
approved parts specific for your
vehicle type. We cannot assess or
guarantee reliability of other products
- even if they have a regulatory or
otherwise granted approval.
Any modification, conversion or other
changes made to standard vehicle
specifications (including, without
limitation, software modifications,
modifications of the electronic control
units) may invalidate the warranty
offered by Opel. Furthermore, such
changes may affect driver assistance
systems, may impact fuel
consumption, CO2 emissions and
other emissions of the vehicle and
cause the vehicle to no longer
conform to the operating permit,
impacting the validity of your vehicle
registration.

Wheels and tyres

Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the speed sticker in
the driver's field of view.
All tyre sizes are permitted as winter
tyres 3 239.

Tyre designations
E.g. 195/65 R 15 91 T
195 : tyre width, mm
65 : cross-section ratio (tyre height

to tyre width), %

T : up to 190 km/h
H : up to 210 km/h
V : up to 240 km/h
W : up to 270 km/h
Choose a tyre appropriate for the
maximum speed of your vehicle.
The maximum speed is achievable at
kerb weight with driver (75 kg) plus
125 kg payload. Optional equipment
could reduce the maximum speed of
the vehicle.
Performance 3 235.

Directional tyres
Directional tyres should be mounted
so that they rotate in the correct
direction. The proper rotation
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel. This also applies to vehicles
with tyre pressure monitoring system.

Tyre pressure 3 239.

The tyre pressure information label
on the left door frame indicates the
original equipment tyres and the
correspondent tyre pressures.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.
Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options. For the correct tyre
pressure value, follow the procedure
below:
1. Identify drive axle and body style.
2. Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 233.

3. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 239.

For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

9 Warning

For specific tyres the
recommended tyre pressure as
shown in the tyre pressure table
may exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.
Never exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.

Vehicle care

207

Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase. Tyre pressure
values provided on the tyre
information label and tyre pressure
chart are valid for cold tyres, which
means at 20 °C.
The pressure increases by nearly
10 kPa for a 10 °C temperature
increase. This must be considered
when warm tyres are checked.

Tyre deflation detection
system
The tyre deflation detection system
continually checks the rotation speed
of all four wheels and warns on low
tyre pressure condition once vehicle
is driving. This is achieved by
comparing tyre rolling circumference
with reference values.
If a tyre loses pressure the control
indicator w illuminates and a warning
message is displayed in the Driver
Information Centre.

Vehicle care

208
In this case reduce speed, avoid
sharp cornering and strong braking.
Stop at next safe opportunity and
check tyre pressure.
Control indicator w 3 94.
After adjusting tyre pressure initialise
system to extinguish the control
indicator and restart system.

Caution

Deflation detection system warns
just about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

In case of a system malfunction a
message is displayed in the Driver
Information Centre. Set correct tyre
pressure and reinitialise system. If the
failure continues to be displayed,
contact a workshop. The system is
inoperable when ABS or ESC has a
malfunction or a temporary spare
wheel is used. Once the road tyre has
been refitted, check the tyre pressure
with cold tyres and initialise the
system.

System initialisation

After tyre pressure correction or
wheel change, the system must be
initialised to learn new circumference
reference values:
1. Always ensure that all four tyres

have correct tyre pressure
3 239.

2. Apply manual parking brake.
3. Press w to reset deflation

detection system.

4. Reset is confirmed by pop-up

indication.

After initialisation system
automatically calibrates to new tyre
pressures during driving. After longer
drive the system will adopt and
monitor new pressures.
Always check tyre pressure with cold
tyres.
System has to be reinitialised when:
● Tyre pressure has been changed
● Load condition has been

changed

● Wheels have been swapped or

exchanged

The system will not warn
instantaneously on a tyre blow out or
a rapid deflation. This is due to
required calculation time.

Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.
Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).

Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every 6 years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as to reinitialise
the tyre deflation detection system
and make other vehicle modifications.
Tyre deflation detection system
3 207.
Have the label with tyre pressures
replaced.

9 Warning

The use of unsuitable tyres or
wheels may lead to accidents and
will invalidate the vehicle
operating permit.

Vehicle care

209

Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.

Vehicles with steel wheels: When
using locking wheel nuts, do not
attach wheel covers.

For safety reasons, it is
recommended that the tread depth of
the tyres on one axle should not vary
by more than 2 mm.

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear
indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.
If there is more wear at the front than
the rear, swap round front wheels and
rear wheels periodically. Ensure that
the direction of rotation of the wheels
remains the same.

Vehicle care

210
Tyre chains

Tyre chains are only permitted on the
front wheels.
Always use fine mesh chains that add
no more than 10 mm to the tyre tread
and the inboard sides (including chain
lock).

9 Warning

Damage may lead to tyre blowout.

Tyre chains are only permitted on
tyres of size 195/65 R15 91 and
195/60 R16 89
Temporary spare wheel

The use of tyre chains is not permitted
on the temporary spare wheel.

Tyre repair kit
Minor damage to the tyre tread can be
repaired with the tyre repair kit.
Do not remove foreign bodies from
the tyres.
Tyre damage exceeding 4 mm or that
is at tyre's sidewall cannot be repaired
with the tyre repair kit.

9 Warning

Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use a de-icing agent only
when absolutely necessary, as this
has a degreasing effect and impairs
lock function. After using a de-icing
agent, have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select a programme that
includes waxing.
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.

If using a vehicle wash, comply with
the vehicle wash manufacturer's
instructions. The windscreen wiper
and rear window wiper must be
switched off. Remove antenna and
external accessories such as roof
racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Wax painted parts of the vehicle
regularly.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.
Clean bright metal mouldings with a
cleaning solution approved for
aluminium to avoid damages.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of four to nine.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Vehicle care

221
Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.

Vehicle care

222
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Plastic body parts must not be treated
with wax or polishing agents.
Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with a
soft cloth and window cleaner.
Remove dirt residues from smearing
wiper blades by using a soft cloth and
window cleaner. Also make sure to
remove any residues such as wax,
insect residues and similar from the
window.

Ice residues, pollution and continuous
wiping on dry windows will damage or
even destroy the wiper blades.
Glass panel
Never clean with solvents or abrasive
agents, fuels, aggressive media
(e.g. paint cleaner, acetone-
containing solutions etc.), acidic or
highly alkaline media or abrasive
pads.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.

Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Liquid gas system

9 Danger

Liquid gas is heavier than air and
can collect in sink points.
Take care when performing work
at the underbody in a pit.

223

Vehicle care
Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-
coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, like zips or
belts or studded jeans.

For painting work and when using a
drying booth at a temperature above
60 °C, the liquid gas tank must be
removed.
Do not make any modifications to the
liquid gas system.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil
aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.

Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
gasoline and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities have to be used.
Recommendations for gasoline
engines are also valid for
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG),
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and
Ethanol (E85) fuelled engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 230.
Topping up engine oil

Caution

In case of any spilled oil, wipe it up
and dispose it properly.

Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.

Use of engine oils for all petrol
engines with only ACEA quality is
prohibited, since it can cause engine
damage under certain operating
conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 230.
Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 230.

Service and maintenance

227

Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.

All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only organic acid type-long life
coolant (LLC) antifreeze approved for
the vehicle. Consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -37 °C.
This concentration should be
maintained all year round. The use of
additional coolant additives that
intend to give additional corrosion
protection or seal against minor leaks
can cause function problems. Liability
for consequences resulting from the
use of additional coolant additives will
be rejected.
Washer fluid
Use only washer fluid approved for
the vehicle to prevent damage of
wiper blades, paintwork, plastic and
rubber parts. Consult a workshop.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
● operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels)
● status messages of the vehicle
and its single components (e.g.
number of wheel revolutions /
rotational speed, deceleration,
lateral acceleration)

● dysfunctions and defects in

important system components

Customer information

248
● vehicle reactions in particular

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the
stability regulation system)

● environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature)

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimising vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
