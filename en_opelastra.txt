side-on collision of a certain severity,
the front and rear seat belts are
tightened. The front seat belts are
tightened by two pretensioners per
seat. The outer rear seat belts are
tightened by one pretensioner per
seat.

9 Warning

Incorrect handling (e.g. removal or
fitting of belts) can trigger the belt
pretensioners.

Deployment of the belt pretensioners
is indicated by continuous illumination
of control indicator v 3 109.
Triggered belt pretensioners must be
replaced by a workshop. Belt
pretensioners can only be triggered
once.
Note
Do not affix or install accessories or
other objects that may interfere with
the operation of the belt
pretensioners. Do not make any

modifications to belt pretensioner
components as this will invalidate
the vehicle type approval.

Using the seat belt while pregnant

9 Warning

The lap belt must be positioned as
low as possible across the pelvis
to prevent pressure on the
abdomen.

Airbag system
The airbag system consists of a
number of individual systems
depending on the scope of
equipment.
When triggered, the airbags inflate
within milliseconds. They also deflate
so quickly that it is often unnoticeable
during the collision.

9 Warning

If handled improperly, the airbag
systems can be triggered in an
explosive manner.

Note
The airbag systems and belt
pretensioner control electronics are
located in the centre console area.
Do not put any magnetic objects in
this area.
Do not stick anything on the airbag
covers and do not cover them with
other materials.
Each airbag is triggered only once.
Have deployed airbags replaced by
a workshop. Furthermore, it might be

necessary to have the steering
wheel, the instrument panel, parts of
the panelling, the door seals,
handles and the seats replaced.
Do not make any modifications to
the airbag system as this will
invalidate the vehicle type approval.
When the airbags inflate, escaping
hot gases may cause burns.

Beyond the warning required by
ECE R94.02, for safety reasons a
forward-facing child restraint system
must only be used subject to the
instructions and restrictions in the
table 3 67.
The airbag label is located on both
sides of the front passenger sun visor.
Airbag deactivation 3 63.

Front airbag system
The front airbag system consists of
one airbag in the steering wheel and
one in the instrument panel on the
front passenger side. These can be
identified by the word AIRBAG.
The front airbag system is triggered in
the event of a front-end impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

Seats, restraints

61

9 Warning

Optimum protection is only
provided when the seat is in the
proper position.
Seat position 3 47.
Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
Fit the seat belt correctly and
engage securely. Only then is the
airbag able to protect.
Side airbag system

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and head of
the front seat occupants
considerably.

Seats, restraints

62
The side airbag system consists of an
airbag in each front seat backrest.
This can be identified by the word
AIRBAG.
The side airbag system is triggered in
the event of a side impact of a certain
severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and pelvis in
the event of a side-on collision
considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Note
Only use protective seat covers that
have been approved for the vehicle.
Be careful not to cover the airbags.
Curtain airbag system
The curtain airbag system consists of
an airbag in the roof frame on each
side. This can be identified by the
word AIRBAG on the roof pillars.
The curtain airbag system is triggered
in the event of a side-on impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the head in the event of a
side-on impact considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
The hooks on the handles in the
roof frame are only suitable for
hanging up light articles of
clothing, without coat hangers. Do
not keep any items in these
clothes.

Airbag deactivation
The front passenger airbag system
must be deactivated for child restraint
system on the passenger seat
according to the instructions in the
table 3 67. The side airbag and
curtain airbag systems, the belt
pretensioners and all driver airbag
systems will remain active.

The front passenger airbag system
can be deactivated via a key-
operated switch on the right side of
the instrument panel.

Seats, restraints

63

Use the ignition key to choose the
position:
*OFF : front passenger airbag is
deactivated and will not
inflate in the event of a
collision. Control indicator
*OFF illuminates

console

VON : front passenger airbag is

active

9 Danger

Deactivate passenger airbag only
in combination with the use of a
child restraint system, subject to
the instructions and restrictions in
the table 3 67.
Otherwise, there is a risk of fatal
injury for a person occupying a
seat with a deactivated front
passenger airbag.

If the control indicator V illuminates
for approx. 60 seconds after the
ignition is switched on, the front
passenger airbag system will inflate
in the event of a collision.
If both control indicators are
illuminated at the same time, there is
a system failure. The status of the
system is not discernible, therefore
no person is allowed to occupy the
front passenger seat. Contact a
workshop immediately.
Consult a workshop immediately if
neither of the two control indicators
are illuminated.
Change status only when the vehicle
is stopped with the ignition off.

Seats, restraints

64
Status remains until the next change.
Control indicator for airbag
deactivation 3 109.

Always comply with local or national
regulations. In some countries, the
use of child restraint systems is

universal category positions are
marked in the table by IUF 3 67.
Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This makes sure that the

Loading information

● Heavy objects in the load

compartment should be placed
against the seat backrests. Make
sure that the backrests are
securely engaged, i.e. no longer
showing the red markings on the
side near the release lever. If
objects can be stacked, heavier
objects should be placed at the
bottom.

● Secure objects with lashing

straps attached to lashing eyes
3 81.

● Secure loose objects in the load

compartment to prevent them
from sliding.

● When transporting objects in the
load compartment, the backrests
of the rear seats must not be
angled forward.

● Do not allow the load to protrude

above the upper edge of the
backrests.

● Sports Tourer: install safety net
when transporting objects in the
load compartment.

● Do not place any objects on the
load compartment cover or the
instrument panel, and do not
cover the sensor on top of the
instrument panel.

● The load must not obstruct the
operation of the pedals, parking
brake and gear selector lever, or
hinder the freedom of movement
of the driver. Do not place any
unsecured objects in the interior.

● Do not drive with an open load

compartment.

9 Warning

Always make sure that the load in
the vehicle is securely stowed.
Otherwise objects can be thrown
around inside the vehicle and
cause personal injury or damage
to the load or car.

● The payload is the difference
between the permitted gross
vehicle weight (see identification
plate 3 264) and the EC kerb
weight.
To calculate the payload, enter
the data for your vehicle in the
weights table at the front of this
manual.
The EC kerb weight includes
weights for the driver (68 kg),
luggage (7 kg) and all fluids (fuel
tank 90% full).
Optional equipment and
accessories increase the kerb
weight.

● Driving with a roof load increases

the sensitivity of the vehicle to
cross-winds and has a

Storage

89

detrimental effect on vehicle
handling due to the vehicle's
higher centre of gravity.
Distribute the load evenly and
secure it properly with retaining
straps. Adjust the tyre pressure
and vehicle speed according to
the load conditions. Check and
retighten the straps frequently.
Do not drive faster than
120 km/h.
The permissible roof load is
75 kg. The roof load is the
combined weight of the roof rack
and the load.

transmission automated, electric
parking brake and power button
On vehicles with manual transmission
automated the ignition can only be
switched off if the parking brake is
applied. Therefore the following items
must be carried out to release the
electric parking brake:

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.

Diesel particle filter
Automatic cleaning process
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving without
any notification. The filter is cleaned
by periodically burning off the soot
particles at high temperature. This
process takes place automatically
under set driving conditions and may
take up to 25 minutes. Typically it
needs between seven and twelve
minutes. Autostop is not available
and fuel consumption may be higher
during this period. The emission of
smells and smoke during this process
is normal.
System requires manual cleaning
process
Under certain driving conditions, e.g.
short distances, the system cannot
clean itself automatically.
If cleaning of the filter is required and
if previous driving conditions did not
enable automatic cleaning, it will be

165

Driving and operating
indicated by % and a warning
message in the Driver Information
Centre.
% with a warning message
illuminates when diesel particle filter
is full. Start cleaning process as soon
as possible.
% with a warning message flashes
when diesel particle filter has reached
the maximum filling level. Start
cleaning process immediately to
avoid damage to the engine.
Activate manual cleaning process
To activate cleaning process,
continue driving, keep engine speed
above 2000 revolutions per minute.
Shift down if necessary. Diesel
particle filter cleaning is then started.
Cleaning takes place quickest at high
engine speeds and loads.
The control indicator % extinguishes
as soon as the self-cleaning
operation is complete. Keep on
driving until self-cleaning operation is
complete.

166

Caution

Caution

If the cleaning process is
interrupted, there is a risk of
provoking severe engine damage.

Cleaning process not possible
If cleaning is not possible for any
reasons, Z illuminates and a warning
message appears in the Driver
Information Centre. Engine power
may be reduced. Seek the assistance
of a workshop immediately.

Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the
amount of harmful substances in the
exhaust gases.

Fuel grades other than those listed
on pages 3 204, 3 269 could
damage the catalytic converter or
electronic components.
Unburnt petrol will overheat and
damage the catalytic converter.
Therefore avoid excessive use of
the starter, running the fuel tank
dry and starting the engine by
pushing or towing.

In the event of misfiring, uneven
engine running, a reduction in engine

message is displayed in the Driver
Information Centre. Vehicle
messages 3 121.
Continued driving is restricted or not
possible, depending on the fault.
Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing the journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
Control indicator R 3 110.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.

173
Driving and operating
ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting off, the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.

Ride control systems
Traction Control system
The Traction Control system (TC) is a
component of the Electronic Stability
Control (ESC).
TC improves driving stability when
necessary, regardless of the type of
road surface or tyre grip, by
preventing the drive wheels from
spinning.
As soon as the drive wheels starts to
spin, engine output is reduced and
the wheel spinning the most is braked
individually. This considerably
improves the driving stability of the
vehicle on slippery road surfaces.

TC is operational after each engine
start as soon as the control indicator
b extinguishes.
When TC operates b flashes.

TC can be switched off when spinning

Electronic Stability Control
Electronic Stability Control (ESC)
improves driving stability when
necessary, regardless of the type of
road surface or tyre grip.
As soon as the vehicle starts to
swerve (understeer/oversteer),
engine output is reduced and the
wheels are braked individually.
ESC operates in combination with the
Traction Control system (TC). It
prevents the drive wheels from
spinning.
Torque distribution is a special
feature that allocates the torque to the
drive wheels before the ESC
intervenes. When cornering, the
wheels on the inner curve are braked
individually. Additionally, engine
torque will be delivered to the drive
wheel on the outer curve. This
reduces the tendency of
understeering and improves traction
when cornering fast.

General information

9 Warning

Forward collision alert is just a
warning system and does not
apply the brakes. When
approaching a vehicle ahead too
rapidly, it may not provide you
enough time to avoid a collision.
The driver accepts full
responsibility for the appropriate
following distance based on traffic,
weather and visibility conditions.
The complete attention of the
driver is always required while
driving. The driver must always be
ready to take action and apply the
brakes.

System limitations
The system is designed to warn on
vehicles only, but may react also to
other objects.

In the following cases, forward
collision alert may not detect a vehicle
ahead or sensor performance is
limited:
● on winding roads
● when weather limits visibility,

such as fog, rain, or snow

● when the sensor is blocked by

snow, ice, slush, mud, dirt,
windscreen damage or affected
by foreign items, e.g. stickers

Following distance
indication
The following distance indication
displays the distance to a preceding
moving vehicle. The front camera in
the windscreen is used to detect the
distance of a vehicle directly ahead in
the vehicle's path. It is active at
speeds above 40 km/h.
When a preceding vehicle is detected
ahead, the distance is indicated in
seconds, displayed on a page in the
Driver Information Centre.

On Midlevel display, choose Info
Menu ? via MENU on the turn
signal lever and turn the adjuster

Driving and operating
Active emergency braking
Active emergency braking can help to
reduce the damage and injury from
crashes with vehicles and obstacles
directly ahead, when a collision can
no longer be avoided either by
manual braking or by steering. Before
the active emergency braking
applies, the driver is warned by the
forward collision alert 3 183.
The feature uses various inputs (e.g.
camera sensor, brake pressure,
vehicle speed) to calculate the
probability of a frontal collision.
Active emergency braking operates
above walking speed up to 85 km/h.
A precondition is that the system is
not deactivated by toggling the gap
switch V to Off setting, 3 183.
The system includes:
● brake preparation system
● emergency automatic braking
● forward looking brake assist

186

Driving and operating

9 Warning

This system is not intended to
replace the driver responsibility for
driving the vehicle and looking
ahead. Its function is limited to
supplemental use only. The driver
must continue to apply the brake
pedal as the driving situation
dictates.

Brake preparation system
When approaching a vehicle ahead
so quickly that a collision is likely, the
brake preparation system slightly
pressurises the brakes. This reduces
the response time, when a manual or
automatic braking is requested.
The brake system is prepared so that
braking can occur more rapidly.
The system operates up to a speed of
80 km/h.

Emergency automatic braking
After the brake preparation and just
before the imminent collision, this
function automatically applies limited
braking to reduce the impact speed of
the collision or prohibit a crash.
The system operates up to a speed of
60 km/h.
Below a speed of 40 km/h the system
can apply full braking.
Forward looking brake assist
In addition to the brake preparation
system and emergency automatic
braking, the forward looking brake
assist function makes the brake assist
more sensitive. Therefore,
depressing the brake pedal less
strongly results in immediate hard
braking. This function helps the driver
brake quicker and harder before the
imminent collision.
The system operates up to a speed of
85 km/h.

9 Warning

Active emergency braking is not
designed to apply hard
autonomous braking or to
automatically avoid a collision. It is
designed to reduce the vehicle
speed before a collision. It may not
react for pedestrians or animals.
After a sudden lane change, the
system needs a certain time to
detect the next preceding vehicle.
The complete attention of the
driver is always required while
driving. The driver shall always be
ready to take action and apply the
brakes and steer to avoid
collisions. The system is designed
to work with all occupants wearing
their seat belts.

System limitations
The active emergency braking has
limited or no function during rain,
snow or heavy dirt, as the camera
sensor can be covered by a water
film, dust, ice or snow. In case of
sensor blockage, clean the sensor
cover.

In some cases, the active emergency
braking system may provide an
automatic braking in situations that
seem to be unnecessary, for instance
in parking garages, due to traffic signs
in a curve or due to vehicles in
another lane. This is normal
operation, the vehicle does not need
service. Firmly apply the accelerator
pedal to override the automatic
braking.
Deactivation

Active emergency braking can be
deactivated by repeatedly pressing
the gap switch V to Off setting,

Basic notes on parking assist
systems

9 Warning

Under certain circumstances,
various reflective surfaces on
objects or clothing as well as

external noise sources may cause
the system to fail to detect
obstacles.
Special attention must be paid to
low obstacles which can damage
the lower part of the bumper.

Caution

Performance of the system can be
reduced when sensors are
covered, e.g. by ice or snow.
Performance of the parking assist
system can be reduced due to
heavy loading.
Special conditions apply if there
are taller vehicles in the vicinity
(e.g. off-road vehicles, mini vans,
vans). Object identification and
correct distance indication in the
upper part of these vehicles
cannot be guaranteed.
Objects with a very small reflection
cross-section, e.g. objects of
narrow size or soft materials, may
not be detected by the system.

Parking assist systems do not
detect objects outside the
detection range.

Note
It is possible that the sensor detects
a non-existing object caused by
echo disturbance from external
acoustic noise or mechanical
misalignments (sporadic false
warnings may occur).
Make sure that the front number
plate is properly mounted (not bent
and no gaps to the bumper on the left
or right side) and the sensors are
firmly in place.
Advanced parking assist system
may not respond to changes in the
available parking space after
initiating a parking manoeuvre. The
system may recognize an entry, a
gateway, a courtyard or even a
crossing as a parking slot. After
selecting reverse gear the system

will start a parking manoeuvre. Take
care regarding the availability of the
suggested parking slot.
Surface irregularities, e.g. on
construction zones, are not detected
by the system. The driver accepts
responsibility.
Note
After production, the system
requires a calibration. For optimal
parking guidance, a driving distance
of at least 10 km, including a number
of bends, is required.
Side blind spot alert
The Side blind spot alert system
detects and reports objects on either
side of the vehicle, within a specified
"blind spot" zone. The system alerts
visually in each exterior mirror, when
detecting objects that may not be
visible in the interior and exterior
mirrors.
Side blind spot alert uses some of the
advanced parking assist sensors
which are located in the front and rear
bumper on both sides of the vehicle.

9 Warning

Side blind spot alert does not
replace driver vision.
The system does not detect:
● vehicles outside the side blind

zones which may be rapidly
approaching

● pedestrians, cyclists or animals
Before changing a lane, always
check all mirrors, look over the
shoulder and use the turn signal.

When the system detects a vehicle in
the side blind zone while driving
forwards, either while passing a
vehicle or being passed, a yellow
warning symbol B will illuminate in
the relevant exterior mirror. If the
driver then activates the turn signal,
the warning symbol B starts flashing
yellow as a warning not to change
lanes.

195

Driving and operating
Note
If the overtaking vehicle is at least
10 km/h faster than the vehicle being

Do not let this special feature
tempt you into taking risks when
driving.
Always adapt speed to the road
conditions.
The driver assistance systems do
not relieve the driver from full
responsibility for vehicle
operation.
Lane keep assist
Lane keep assist helps to avoid
crashes due to unintentional lane
departures. The front camera
observes the lane markings between
which the vehicle is driving. If the
vehicle approaches a lane marking,
the steering wheel is gently turned to
position the vehicle back into the lane.
Turn steering wheel in same
direction, if system steers not

sufficient. Turn steering wheel gently
into opposite direction, if lane change
is intended.
When crossing a lane marking
significantly, lane keep assist starts a
visual and acoustic warning.
Unintended lane departure is
assumed
● without using turn signal
● using the turn signal in the

opposite direction of the lane
departure

● without braking
● without acceleration
● without active steering.
Note
The system is switched off during

Fuel consumption - CO2-
Emissions
The fuel consumption (combined) of
the model Opel Astra is within a range
of 6.2 to 3.3 l/100 km.

Driving and operating

206
The CO2 emission (combined) is
within a range of 142 to 88 g/km.
For the values specific for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
General information
The official fuel consumption and
specific CO2 emission figures quoted
relate to the EU base model with
standard equipment.
Fuel consumption data and CO2
emission data are determined
according to regulation R (EC)
No. 715/2007 (in the latest applicable
version), taking into consideration the
vehicle weight in running order, as
specified by the regulation.
The figures are provided only for the
purpose of comparison between
different vehicle variants and must
not be taken as a guarantee for the
actual fuel consumption of a
particular vehicle. Additional
equipment may result in slightly
higher results than the stated

consumption and CO2 figures.
Furthermore, fuel consumption is
dependent on personal driving style
as well as road and traffic conditions.

Trailer hitch
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.
The bulb outage detection function for
trailer brake light cannot detect a
partial bulb outage, e.g. in case of four
times five watt bulbs, the function only
detects lamp outage when only a
single five Watt lamp remains or none
remain.
Fitting of towing equipment could
cover the opening of the towing eye.
If this is the case use the coupling ball
bar for towing. Always keep the
coupling ball bar in the vehicle when
not in use.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements.
During trailer towing do not exceed a
speed of 80 km/h. A maximum speed
of 100 km/h is only appropriate if an
oscillation damper is used and the
permissible gross trailer weight does
not exceed the vehicle’s curb weight.
For trailers with low driving stability
and caravan trailers, the use of an
oscillation damper is strongly
recommended.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 277.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads

9 Warning

Vehicles with engine B14XFT and
automatic transmission:
Use of towing equipment is
permissible for attaching
compatible bicycle carriers only.
Do not use towing equipment for
trailer towing.

The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12%.
The permitted trailer load applies up
to the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea

207
Driving and operating
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10%
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8%, e.g. motorways).
The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 264.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (75 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.

Driving and operating

208
Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) may be exceeded by
40 kg. If the permissible rear axle load
is exceeded, a maximum speed of
100 km/h applies.

Towing equipment
Caution

When operating without a trailer,
remove the coupling ball bar.

Stowage of coupling ball bar
The bag with the coupling ball bar is
stowed on the rear floor cover in the
load compartment.
Place the strap through the rear right
lashing eye, wrap around twice and
tighten the strap to secure the bag.

Wheels and tyres

Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
All tyre sizes are permitted as winter
tyres 3 277.
In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the speed sticker in
the driver's field of view.

Tyre designations
E.g. 215/60 R 16 95 H
215 : Tyre width, mm
60 : Cross-section ratio (tyre height

to tyre width), %
R : Belt type: Radial
RF : Type: RunFlat
16 : Wheel diameter, inches
95 : Load index e.g. 95 is
equivalent to 690 kg

H : Speed code letter
Speed code letter:
Q : up to 160 km/h
S : up to 180 km/h
T : up to 190 km/h

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel.
This also applies to vehicles with tyre
pressure monitoring system.
Unscrew the valve cap.

Tyre pressure 3 277.
The tyre pressure information label
on the left door frame indicates the
original equipment tyres and the
correspondent tyre pressures.

Vehicle care

240
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.
Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options. For the correct tyre
pressure value, follow the procedure
below:
1. Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 269.

2. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 277.
For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.

The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

9 Warning

For specific tyres the
recommended tyre pressure as
shown in the tyre pressure table
may exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.
Never exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.

If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased on a vehicle with tyre
pressure monitoring system, switch
off ignition.

Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase. Tyre pressure
values provided on the tyre
information label and tyre pressure
chart are valid for cold tyres, which
means at 20 °C.
The pressure increases by nearly
10 kPa for a 10 °C temperature
increase. This must be considered
when warm tyres are checked.
The tyre pressure value displayed in
the Driver Information Centre shows
the real tyre pressure. A cooled down
tyre will show a decreased value,
which does not indicate an air leak.

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The tyre pressure monitoring system
checks the pressure of all four tyres
once a minute when vehicle speed
exceeds a certain limit.

Caution

Tyre pressure monitoring system
warns only about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.
Note
In countries where the tyre pressure
monitoring system is legally
required, the use of wheels without
pressure sensors will invalidate the
vehicle type approval.
The current tyre pressures can be
shown in the Driver Information
Centre.

Vehicle care

242
After inflating, some driving may be
required to update the tyre pressure
values in the Driver Information
Centre. During this time w may
illuminate.
If w illuminates at lower temperatures
and extinguishes after driving, this
could be an indicator for approaching
a low tyre pressure condition. Check
tyre pressure.
Vehicle messages 3 121.
If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition.
Only mount wheels with pressure
sensors, otherwise the tyre pressure
will not be displayed and w
illuminates continuously.
A spare wheel or temporary spare
wheel is not equipped with pressure
sensors. The tyre pressure
monitoring system is not operational
for these tyres. Control indicator w
illuminates. For the further three
tyres, the system remains
operational.

The use of commercially-available
liquid tyre repair kits can impair the
function of the system. Factory-
approved repair kits can be used.
Operating electronic devices or being
close to facilities using similar wave
frequencies could disrupt the tyre
pressure monitoring system.
Each time the tyres are replaced, tyre
pressure monitoring system sensors
must be dismounted and serviced.
For the screwed sensor, replace
valve core and sealing ring. For the
clipped sensor, replace complete
valve stem.
Vehicle loading status

Tyre pressure sensor matching
process
Each tyre pressure sensor has a
unique identification code. The
identification code must be matched
to a new wheel position after rotating
the wheels or exchanging the
complete wheel set and if one or more
tyre pressure sensors were replaced.
The tyre pressure sensor matching
process should also be performed
after replacing a spare wheel with a
road wheel containing the tyre
pressure sensor.
The malfunction light w and the
warning message or code should go
off at the next ignition cycle. The
sensors are matched to the wheel
positions, using a relearn tool, in the
following order: left side front wheel,
right side front wheel, right side rear
wheel and left side rear wheel. The
turn signal light at the current active
position is illuminated until sensor is
matched.
Consult a workshop for service or
purchase a relearn tool. There are
two minutes to match the first wheel

Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons it is recommended
that the tread depth of the tyres on
one axle should not vary by more than
2 mm.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and make other vehicle
modifications.
After converting to a different tyre
size, have the label with tyre
pressures replaced.
Furthermore, the advanced parking
assist must be calibrated 3 187.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheels
may lead to accidents and will
invalidate the vehicle type
approval.
Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.

Vehicle care

Towing
Towing the vehicle

Insert a screwdriver in the slot at the
lower part of the cap. Release the cap
by carefully moving the screwdriver
downwards.
The towing eye is stowed with the
vehicle tools 3 237.

Screw in the towing eye as far as it will
go until it stops in a horizontal
position.
Attach a tow rope – or better still a tow
rod – to the towing eye.
The towing eye must only be used for
towing and not for recovering the
vehicle.
Switch on ignition to release steering
wheel lock and to permit operation of
brake lights, horn and windscreen
wiper.
Transmission in neutral.

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

When the engine is not running,
considerably more force is needed to
brake and steer.
To prevent the entry of exhaust gases
from the towing vehicle, switch on the
air recirculation and close the
windows.
Vehicles with automatic transmission:
The vehicle must be towed facing
forwards, not faster than 80 km/h nor
further than 100 km. In all other cases
and when the transmission is
defective, the front axle must be
raised off the ground.
Vehicles with manual transmission
automated: the vehicle must only be
towed facing forwards with the front
axle raised off the ground.
Seek the assistance of a workshop.
After towing, unscrew the towing eye.
Insert cap at the top and engage
downwards.

Vehicle care
Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use de-icing agent only when
absolutely necessary, as this has a
degreasing effect and impairs lock
function. After using a de-icing agent,
have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select a programme that
includes waxing.
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.

If using a vehicle wash, comply with
the vehicle wash manufacturer's
instructions. The windscreen wiper
and rear window wiper must be
switched off. Remove antenna and
external accessories such as roof
racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.
Clean bright metal mouldings with a
cleaning solution approved for
aluminium to avoid damages.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of four to nine.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.

Plastic body parts must not be treated
with wax or polishing agents.
Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Remove dirt residues from smearing
wiper blades by using a soft cloth and
window cleaner. Also make sure to
remove any residues such as wax,
insect residues and similar from the
window.
Ice residues, pollution and continuous
wiping on dry windows will damage or
even destroy the wiper blades.

Sunroof
Never clean with solvents or abrasive
agents, fuels, aggressive media
(e.g. paint cleaner, acetone-
containing solutions etc.), acidic or
highly alkaline media or abrasive
pads. Do not apply wax or polishing
agents to the sunroof.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.

Vehicle care

259
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Air shutter
Clean the shutter system in the front
bumper to maintain correct
functionality.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.

Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

Vehicle care

260
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument cluster and the
displays should only be cleaned using
a soft damp cloth. If necessary use a
weak soap solution.
Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-
coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, like zips or
belts or studded jeans.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil
aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.

Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
gasoline and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities have to be used.
Recommendations for gasoline
engines are also valid for
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG),
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and
Ethanol (E85) fuelled engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 266.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 266.

Service and maintenance

northern countries with very low
temperatures the factory filled coolant
provides frost protection down to
approx. -37 °C. This concentration
should be maintained all year round.
The use of additional coolant
additives that intend to give additional
corrosion protection or seal against
minor leaks can cause function
problems. Liability for consequences
resulting from the use of additional
coolant additives will be rejected.
Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.

Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 266.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only organic acid type-long life
coolant (LLC) antifreeze approved for
the vehicle. Consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C. In

Collision damage repair
Paint thickness
Due to production techniques, the
thickness of the paint can vary
between 50 and 400 µm.
Therefore, different paint thickness is
no indicator for a collision damage
repair.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
● operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels)
● status messages of the vehicle
and its single components (e.g.
number of wheel revolutions /
rotational speed, deceleration,
lateral acceleration)

● dysfunctions and defects in

important system components

Customer information
● vehicle reactions in particular

285

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the
stability regulation system)

● environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature)

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimising vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

Customer information

286
When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
