Seat belt reminder X 3 92.

To release belt, press red button on
belt buckle.

9 Warning

The lap belt must be positioned as
low as possible across the pelvis
to prevent pressure on the

Airbag system
The airbag system consists of a
number of individual systems
depending on the scope of
equipment.
When triggered, the airbags inflate
within milliseconds. They also deflate
so quickly that it is often unnoticeable
during the collision.

9 Warning

If handled improperly the airbag
systems can be triggered in an
explosive manner.

Note
The airbag systems and belt
pretensioner control electronics are
located in the centre console area.
Do not put any magnetic objects in
this area.
Do not affix any objects onto the
airbag covers and do not cover them
with other materials.
Each airbag is triggered only once.
Have deployed airbags replaced by
a workshop. Furthermore, it may be

necessary to have the steering
wheel, the instrument panel, parts of
the panelling, the door seals,
handles and the seats replaced.
Do not make any modifications to
the airbag system as this will
invalidate the vehicle type approval.
When the airbags inflate escaping hot
gases may cause burns.
Fault
If there is a fault in the airbag system
the control indicator v illuminates and
a message or a warning code
appears in the Driver Information
Centre. The system is not
operational.
Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

Beyond the warning required by
ECE R94.02, for safety reasons
never use a forward-facing child
restraint system on the passenger
seat with an active front airbag.

9 Danger

Do not use a child restraint system
on the passenger seat with active
front airbag.

The airbag label is located on both
sides of the front passenger sun visor.
Airbag deactivation 3 63.

Front airbag system
The front airbag system consists of
one airbag in the steering wheel and
one in the instrument panel on the
front passenger side. These can be
identified by the word AIRBAG.

Additionally there is a warning label
on the side of the instrument panel,
visible when the front passenger door
is open, or on the front passenger sun
visor.
The front airbag system is triggered in
the event of a front-end impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and head of
the front seat occupants
considerably.

9 Warning

Optimum protection is only
provided when the seat is in the
proper position.
Seat position 3 49.
Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Fit the seat belt correctly and
engage securely. Only then is the
airbag able to protect.
Side airbag system

63

Seats, restraints
Airbag deactivation
The front passenger airbag system
must be deactivated if a child restraint
system is to be fitted on this seat. The
side airbags, the belt pretensioners
and all driver airbag systems will
remain active.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the head and upper body in
the event of a side-on collision
considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Note
Only use protective seat covers that
have been approved for the vehicle.
Be careful not to cover the airbags.

The side airbag system consists of an
airbag in each front seat backrest.
This can be identified by the word
AIRBAG.
The side airbag system is triggered in
the event of a side impact of a certain
severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The front passenger airbag system
can be deactivated via a key-
operated switch on the right side of
the instrument panel.

Seats, restraints

64
Use the ignition key to choose the
position:
*OFF : front passenger airbag is
deactivated and will not
inflate in the event of a
collision. Control indicator
*OFF illuminates
continuously in the centre
console. A child restraint
system can be installed in
accordance with the chart
Child restraint installation
locations 3 67. No adult
person is allowed to occupy
the front passenger seat.
VON : front passenger airbag is

active. A child restraint
system must not be
installed.

9 Danger

Risk of fatal injury for a child using
a child restraint system on a seat
with activated front passenger
airbag.
Risk of fatal injury for an adult
person on a seat with deactivated
front passenger airbag.

Control indicator for airbag
deactivation 3 92.

If the control indicator V illuminates
for approx. 60 seconds after the
ignition is switched on, the front
passenger airbag system will inflate
in the event of a collision.
If both control indicators are
illuminated at the same time, there is
a system failure. The status of the
system is not discernible, therefore
no person is allowed to occupy the
front passenger seat. Contact a
workshop immediately.
Change status only when the vehicle
is stopped with the ignition off.
Status remains until the next change.

Child restraints
Child restraint systems
We recommend the following child
restraint systems which are tailored
specifically to the vehicle:
● Group 0, Group 0+

OPEL Baby cradle, with or
without ISOFIX base, for children
up to 13 kg

● Group I

OPEL Duo, Britax Römer King,
for children from 9 kg to 18 kg

● Group II, Group III

OPEL Kid, OPEL Kidfix, for
children from 15 kg up to 36 kg

When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.
Always comply with local or national
regulations. In some countries, the
use of child restraint systems is
forbidden on certain seats.

9 Warning

When using a child restraint
system on the front passenger
seat, the airbag systems for the
front passenger seat must be
deactivated; if not, the triggering of
the airbags poses a risk of fatal
injury to the child.
This is especially the case if rear-
facing child restraint systems are
used on the front passenger seat.

Airbag deactivation 3 63.
Airbag label 3 59.

9 Warning

When using child restraint
systems on the rear seats, ensure
that the backrests are engaged
securely in upright position.

Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.

Seats, restraints

65

Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This makes sure that the
child's backbone, which is still very
weak, is under less strain in the event
of an accident.
Suitable are restraint systems that
comply with valid UN ECE
regulations. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct, see following
tables.
Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.
When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.

Seats, restraints

Note
Do not affix anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.

If a headlight flash is activated when
the high beam is off, the high beam
assist will stay activated.
High beam assist is always active
after the ignition is switched on.
Intelligent light ranging with
automatic high beam activation
Intelligent light ranging uses the
properties of Bi-Xenon headlights to
extend the light range of the low beam
by up to 400 metres and additionally
activates automatic high beam
without dazzling or disturbing
oncoming or preceding traffic.
High beam is deactivated and the low
beam light range is reduced to avoid
dazzling when the following
restrictions are detected by the front
camera in the windscreen:
● A preceding vehicle is

recognised.

● An oncoming vehicle is

recognised.

Lighting

Driving and operating
Ground clearance
Due to the reduced ground clearance,
the vehicle can be damaged
depending on the vehicle loading and
appearance of the ground. Take
special care and drive slowly on steep
driveways, entry and exit of parking
garages, high kerbs and uneven
surfaces. If possible, drive diagonally
with one wheel after another when
running over kerbs or uneven
surfaces.

Driving hints
Control of the vehicle
Never coast with engine not
running (except during Autostop)
Many systems will not function in this
situation (e.g. brake servo unit, power
steering). Driving in this manner is a
danger to yourself and others. All
systems function during an Autostop,
but there will be a controlled reduction
in power steering assist and vehicle
speed is reduced.
Stop-start system 3 141.
Idle boost
If charging of the battery is required
due to battery condition, the power
output of the generator has to be
increased. This will be achieved by an
idle boost which may be audible. A
message is displayed in the Driver
Information Centre.

Pedals
To ensure the pedal travel is
uninhibited, there must be no mats in
the area of the pedals.
Use only floor mats, which fit properly
and are fixed by the retainers on the
driver's side.

Steering
If power steering assist is lost
because the engine stops or due to a
system malfunction, the vehicle can
be steered but may require increased
effort.
Control indicator c 3 94.

Caution

Vehicles equipped with hydraulic
power steering:
If the steering wheel is turned until
it reaches the end of its travel, and
is held in that position for more
than 15 seconds, damage may
occur to the power steering
system and there may be loss of
power steering assist.

Driving and operating

140
Starting and operating
New vehicle running-in
Do not brake unnecessarily hard for
the first few journeys.
During the first drive, smoke may
occur because of wax and oil
evaporating off the exhaust system.
Park the vehicle in the open for a
while after the first drive and avoid
inhaling the fumes.
During the running-in period fuel and
engine oil consumption may be
higher and the cleaning process of
the diesel particle filter may take
place more often. Autostop may be
inhibited to allow for charging the
vehicle battery.

During an Autostop, the engine can
be started by depressing the clutch
pedal.
Starting the vehicle at low
temperatures
Starting the engine without additional
heaters is possible down to -25 °С for
diesel engines and -30 °C for petrol
engines. Required is an engine oil
with the correct viscosity, the correct
fuel, performed services and a
sufficiently charged vehicle battery.
With temperatures below -30 °C the
automatic transmission needs a
warming phase of approx. 5 minutes.
The selector lever must be in position
P.

Automatic Starter Control
This function controls the engine
starting procedure. The driver does
not have to hold the key in position 3.
Once applied, the system will go on
starting automatically until the engine
is running. Because of the checking
procedure, the engine starts running
after a short delay.
Possible reasons for a non-starting
engine:
● Clutch pedal not operated

(manual transmission).

● Brake pedal not operated or
selector lever not in P or N
(automatic transmission).

● Timeout occurred.
Turbo engine warm-up
Upon start-up, engine available
torque may be limited for a short time,
especially when the engine
temperature is cold. The limitation is
to allow the lubrication system to fully
protect the engine.

141

Driving and operating
Overrun cut-off
The fuel supply is automatically cut off
during overrun, i.e. when the vehicle
is driven with a gear engaged but
accelerator is released.

Stop-start system
The stop-start system helps to save
fuel and to reduce the exhaust
emissions. When conditions allow, it
switches off the engine as soon as the
vehicle is at a low speed or at a
standstill, e.g. at a traffic light or in a
traffic jam. It starts the engine
automatically as soon as the clutch is
depressed. A vehicle battery sensor
ensures that an Autostop is only
performed if the vehicle battery is
sufficiently charged for a restart.

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving without
any notification. The filter is cleaned
by periodically burning off the soot
particles at high temperature. This
process takes place automatically
under set driving conditions and may
take up to 25 minutes. Typically it

needs between 7 and 12 minutes.
Autostop is not available and fuel
consumption may be higher during
this period. The emission of smells
and smoke during this process is
normal.

Under certain driving conditions, e.g.
short distances, the system cannot
clean itself automatically.
If the cleaning of the filter is required
and if previous driving conditions did
not enable automatic cleaning, it will
be indicated by control indicator %.
Simultaneously Diesel partic. filter is
full continue driving appears in the
Driver Information Centre.

145

Driving and operating
% illuminates when diesel particle
filter is full. Start cleaning process as
soon as possible.
% flashes when diesel particle filter
has reached the maximum filling
level. Start cleaning process
immediately to avoid damage to the
engine.
Cleaning process
To activate cleaning process,
continue driving, keep engine speed
above 2000 revolutions per minute.
Shift down if necessary. Diesel
particle filter cleaning is then started.
If additionally a message appears in
the Driver Information Centre that
cleaning is not possible, seek the
assistance of a workshop.

Caution

If the cleaning process is
interrupted, there is a risk of
provoking severe engine damage.

Cleaning takes place quickest at high
engine speeds and loads.

Driving and operating
146
The control indicator % extinguishes
as soon as the self-cleaning
operation is complete.

Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the
amount of harmful substances in the
exhaust gases.

Caution

Fuel grades other than those listed
on pages 3 181, 3 243 could
damage the catalytic converter or
electronic components.
Unburnt petrol will overheat and
damage the catalytic converter.

AdBlue
General information
The selective catalytic reduction
(BlueInjection) is a method to
substantially reduce the nitrogen
oxides in the exhaust emission. This
is achieved by injecting a Diesel
Exhaust Fluid (DEF) into the exhaust
system.
The designation of the DEF used is
AdBlue Ⓡ1). It is a non-toxic, non-
flammable, colourless and odourless
fluid which consists of 32% urea and
68% water.

9 Warning

In the event of misfiring, uneven
engine running, a reduction in engine
performance or other unusual
problems, have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop as soon as
possible. In an emergency, driving
1) Registered trademark of the Verband der Automobilindustrie e.V. (VDA).

Avoid contact of your eyes or skin
with AdBlue.
In case of eye or skin contact,
rinse off with water.

Caution

Avoid contact of the paintwork with
AdBlue.
In case of contact, rinse off with
water.

AdBlue freezes at a temperature of
approx. -11 °C. As the vehicle is
equipped with an AdBlue pre-heater,
the emissions reduction at low
temperatures is ensured. The AdBlue
pre-heater works automatically.
Level warnings
The AdBlue consumption is approx.
0.7 litres per 1000 km and depends
on the driving behaviour.
If the AdBlue level falls below a
certain value, a level warning AdBlue
Range: 2400 km will be displayed in
the Driver Information Centre.
A volume of at least 5 litres of AdBlue
must be refilled as soon as possible.
Driving is possible without any
restrictions.

Additionally, the control indicator Y
flashes continuously and a warning
chime sounds four times every
three minutes.
After the prevention of the engine
start, the following message:
Refill AdBlue To Start Vehicle
will be displayed.
To restart the engine, the tank must
be filled with AdBlue first.
High emission warnings
If the exhaust emission rises above a
certain value, warnings similar to the
range warnings as described above
will be displayed in the Driver
Information Centre.
Requests to have the exhaust system
checked and finally the
announcement to prevent an engine

If AdBlue must be refilled at
temperatures below -11 °C, the
refilling of AdBlue may not be
detected by the system. In this case,
park the vehicle in a space with a
higher ambient temperature until
AdBlue is liquefied.

Note
When unscrewing the protective cap
from the filler neck, ammonia fumes
may emerge. Do not inhale as the
fumes have a pungent smell. The
fumes are not harmful by inhalation.
The vehicle must be parked on a level
surface.
The filler neck for AdBlue is located
behind the fuel filler flap.
The fuel filler flap is located at right
rear side of the vehicle.
The fuel filler flap can only be opened

Upshift indication 3 94.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing your journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
Control indicator R 3 93.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.

153
Driving and operating
ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting off the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.

Front-rear parking assist

9 Warning

The driver bears full responsibility
for the parking manoeuvre.
Always check the surrounding
area when driving backwards or
forwards while using parking
assist system.

The front-rear parking assist
measures the distance between the
vehicle and obstacles in front and

behind the vehicle. The system gives
acoustic signals and display
messages.

167
Driving and operating
Parking assist button and operation
logic

The system has four ultrasonic
parking sensors each in the rear and
front bumper.
It uses two different acoustic warning
signals for the front and rear
monitoring areas, each with a
different tone frequency. The signal
for front obstacles sounds via the
front speakers, for rear obstacles it
sounds via the rear speakers.

the system to fail to detect
obstacles.
Special attention must be paid to
low obstacles which can damage
the lower part of the bumper.

Caution

Performance of the system can be
reduced when sensors are
covered, e.g. by ice or snow.
Performance of the parking assist
system can be reduced due to
heavy loading.
Special conditions apply if there
are taller vehicles in the vicinity
(e.g. off-road vehicles, mini vans,
vans). Object identification and

correct distance indication in the
upper part of these vehicles
cannot be guaranteed.
Objects with a very small reflection
cross-section, e.g. objects of
narrow size or soft materials, may
not be detected by the system.
Parking assist systems do not
detect objects outside the
detection range.

Note

Fuel consumption - CO2-
Emissions
The fuel consumption (combined) is
within a range of 7.3 to 5.2 l/100 km.
The CO2 emission (combined) is
within a range of 172 to 138 g/km.
For the values specific to your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
General information
The official fuel consumption and
specific CO2 emission figures quoted
relate to the EU base model with
standard equipment.
Fuel consumption data and CO2
emission data are determined
according to regulation
R (EC) No. 715/2007 (in the latest

applicable version), taking into
consideration the vehicle weight in
running order, as specified by the
regulation.
The figures are provided only for the
purpose of comparison between
different vehicle variants and must
not be taken as a guarantee for the
actual fuel consumption of a
particular vehicle. Additional
equipment may result in slightly
higher results than the stated
consumption and CO2 figures.
Furthermore, fuel consumption is
dependent on personal driving style
as well as road and traffic conditions.

Trailer hitch
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.
The bulb outage detection function for
trailer brake light cannot detect a
partial bulb outage, e.g. in case of 4 x
5 Watt bulbs, the function only detects
lamp outage when only a single
5 Watt lamp remains or none remain.
Fitting of towing equipment could
cover the opening of the towing eye.
If this is the case use the coupling ball
bar for towing. Always keep the
coupling ball bar in the vehicle.

185

Driving and operating
The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 238.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (75 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements.
For trailers with low driving stability
and caravan trailers with a permitted
gross vehicle weight of more than
1200 kg the use of a stabiliser is
strongly recommended when driving
above 80 km/h.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 249.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12%.
The permitted trailer load applies up
to the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10%
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8%, e.g. motorways).

Driving and operating

186
Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) may be exceeded by
100 kg, the gross vehicle weight
rating may be exceeded by 100 kg. If
the permissible rear axle load is
exceeded, a maximum speed of
100 km/h applies.

Towing equipment
Caution

When operating without a trailer,
remove the coupling ball bar.

Stowage of coupling ball bar
The coupling ball bar is stowed in a
bag and must be secured in the load
compartment.

Vehicle with spare wheel

Wheels
On vehicles with Diesel engines no
steel rims and only special, for this
vehicle approved alloy wheels are
permitted.
Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
All tyre sizes are permitted as winter
tyres 3 249.

Use tyre size 225/55 R17 only as
winter tyres.
On vehicles with Diesel engines, no
steel rims and only special, vehicle-
approved alloy wheels are permitted.
In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the speed sticker in
the driver's field of view.

Tyre designations
E.g. 235/55 R 17 99 V
235 : Tyre width, mm
55 : Cross-section ratio (tyre height

Directional tyres
Fit directional tyres such that they roll
in the direction of travel. The rolling
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The tyre pressure monitoring system
(TPMS) checks the pressure of all
four tyres once a minute when vehicle
speed exceeds a certain limit.

Caution

Tyre pressure monitoring system
warns only about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.

Vehicle care

214
Note
In countries where the tyre pressure
monitoring system is legally
required, the use of wheels without
pressure sensors will invalidate the
vehicle type approval.
The current tyre pressures can be
shown in the Vehicle Information
Menu in the Driver Information
Centre.
The menu can be selected by the
buttons on the turn signal lever.

Press MENU to select the Vehicle
Information MenuX.

Turn the adjuster wheel to select the
tyre pressure monitoring system.
System status and pressure warnings
are displayed by a message with the
corresponding tyre flashing in the
Driver Information Centre.
The system considers the tyre
temperature for the warnings.

A detected low tyre pressure
condition is indicated by control
indicator w 3 96.
If w illuminates, stop as soon as
possible and inflate the tyres as
recommended 3 249.
If w flashes for 60-90 seconds then
illuminates continuously, there is a
fault in the system. Consult a
workshop.
After inflating, driving may be
required to update the tyre pressure
values in the Driver Information
Centre. During this time w may
illuminate.

Each time the tyres are replaced, tyre
pressure monitoring system sensors
must be dismounted and serviced.
For the screwed sensor: replace
valve core and sealing ring. For
clipped sensor: replace complete
valve stem.
Vehicle loading status
Adjust tyre pressure to load condition
according to the tyre information label
or tyre pressure chart 3 249, and
select the appropriate setting in the
Tyre load menu in the Driver
Information Centre 3 98. This setting
is the reference for the tyre pressure
warnings.
The menu Tyre Load only appears if
the vehicle is in a standstill and the
parking brake is applied. On vehicles
with automatic transmission, the
selector lever must be in P.

If w illuminates at lower temperatures
and extinguishes after some driving,
this could be an indicator for
approaching a low tyre pressure
condition. Check tyre pressure.
Vehicle messages 3 104.
If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition.
Only mount wheels with pressure
sensors, otherwise the tyre pressure
will not be displayed and w
illuminates continuously.
A temporary spare wheel is not
equipped with pressure sensors. The
tyre pressure monitoring system is
not operational for these wheels.
Control indicator w illuminates. For
the further three wheels the system
remains operational.
The use of commercially available
liquid tyre repair kits can impair the
function of the system. Factory-
approved repair kits can be used.
Operating electronic devices or being
close to facilities using similar wave

TPMS sensor matching process
Each TPMS sensor has a unique
identification code. The identification
code must be matched to a new
wheel position after rotating the
wheels or exchanging the complete
wheel set and if one or more TPMS
sensors were replaced. The TPMS
sensor matching process should also

Vehicle care

216
be performed after replacing a spare
wheel with a road wheel containing
the TPMS sensor.
The malfunction light w and the
warning message or code should go
off at the next ignition cycle. The
sensors are matched to the wheel
positions, using a TPMS relearn tool,
in the following order: left side front
wheel, right side front wheel, right
side rear wheel and left side rear
wheel. The turn signal light at the
current active position is illuminated
until sensor is matched.
Consult your workshop for service or
to purchase a relearn tool. There are
2 minutes to match the first wheel
position, and 5 minutes overall to
match all four wheel positions. If it
takes longer, the matching process
stops and must be restarted.
The TPMS sensor matching process
is:
1. Apply the parking brake; on

vehicles with automatic
transmission set the selector lever
to P.

2. Turn the ignition on.

3. Use MENU on the turn signal

lever to select the Vehicle
Information Menu in the Driver
Information Centre.

4. Turn the adjuster wheel to scroll to

the tyre pressure menu.

5. Press SET/CLR to begin the
sensor matching process. A
message requesting acceptance
of the process should display.

6. Press SET/CLR again to confirm

the selection. The horn sounds
twice to signal the receiver is in
relearn mode.

7. Start with the left side front wheel.
8. Place the relearn tool against the
tyre sidewall, near the valve stem.
Then press the button to activate
the TPMS sensor. A horn chirp
confirms that the sensor
identification code has been
matched to this wheel position.
9. Proceed to the right side front

wheel, and repeat the procedure
in Step 8.

10. Proceed to the right side rear

wheel, and repeat the procedure
in Step 8.

11. Proceed to the left side rear

wheel, and repeat the procedure
in Step 8. The horn sounds twice
to indicate the sensor
identification code has been
matched to the left side rear tyre,
and the TPMS sensor matching
process is no longer active.

12. Turn off the ignition.
13. Set all four tyres to the

recommended air pressure level
as indicated on the tyre pressure
label.

14. Ensure the tyre loading status is
set according selected pressure
3 98.

Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase. Tyre pressure
values provided on the tyre
information label and tyre pressure
chart are valid for cold tyres, which
means at 20 °C. The pressure
increases by nearly 10 kPa for a

10 °C temperature increase. This
must be considered when warm tyres
are checked.
The tyre pressure value displayed in
the Driver Information Centre shows
the real tyre pressure. A cooled down
tyre will show a decreased value,
which does not indicate an air leak.

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel. This also applies to vehicles
with tyre pressure monitoring system.
Unscrew the valve cap.

Tyre pressure 3 249.
The tyre pressure information label
on the left door frame indicates the
original equipment tyres and the
correspondent tyre pressures.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.
Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options. For the correct tyre
pressure value, follow the procedure
below:
1. Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 243.

2. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 249.

Vehicle care

217

For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased on a vehicle with tyre
pressure monitoring system, switch
off ignition. After adjusting tyre
pressure switch on ignition and select
the relevant setting on the page Tyre
load in the Driver Information Centre
3 98.

Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.

Vehicle care

218
Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons it is recommended
that the tread depth of the tyres on
one axle should not vary by more than
2 mm.

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear
indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.

Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.

Vehicles with steel wheels: When
using locking wheel nuts, do not
attach wheel covers.

If there is more wear at the front than
the rear, swap round front wheels and
rear wheels periodically. Ensure that
the direction of rotation of the wheels
is the same as before.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every 6 years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and make other vehicle
modifications.
After converting to a different tyre
size, have the label with tyre
pressures replaced.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheels
may lead to accidents and will
invalidate the vehicle type
approval.

Jump starting
Do not start with quick charger.
A vehicle with a discharged vehicle
battery can be started using jump
leads and the vehicle battery of
another vehicle.

9 Warning

Be extremely careful when starting
with jump leads. Any deviation
from the following instructions can
lead to injuries or damage caused
by battery explosion or damage to
the electrical systems of both
vehicles.

9 Warning

Avoid contact of the battery with
eyes, skin, fabrics and painted
surfaces. The fluid contains
sulphuric acid which can cause
injuries and damage in the event
of direct contact.

● Never expose the battery to

naked flames or sparks.

● A discharged vehicle battery can
already freeze at a temperature
of 0 °C. Defrost the frozen battery
before connecting jump leads.

● Wear eye protection and
protective clothing when
handling a battery.

● Use a booster battery with the

same voltage (12 Volts). Its
capacity (Ah) must not be much
less than that of the discharged
battery.

● Use jump leads with insulated

terminals and a cross section of
at least 16 mm2 (25 mm2 for
diesel engines).

● Do not disconnect the discharged

battery from the vehicle.

● Switch off all unnecessary

electrical consumers.

● Do not lean over the battery

during jump starting.

● Do not allow the terminals of one
lead to touch those of the other
lead.

● The vehicles must not come into

contact with each other during
the jump starting process.

● Apply the parking brake,
transmission in neutral,
automatic transmission in P.

● Open the positive terminal

protection caps of both batteries.

Caution

Towing another vehicle

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

When the engine is not running,
considerably more force is needed to
brake and steer.
To prevent the entry of exhaust gases
from the towing vehicle, switch on the
air recirculation and close the
windows, when soft top is closed.
Vehicles with automatic transmission:
The vehicle must be towed facing
forwards, not faster than 80 km/h nor
further than 100 km. In all other cases
and when the transmission is
defective, the front axle must be
raised off the ground.
Seek the assistance of a workshop.
After towing, unscrew the towing eye
clockwise.
Insert cap at the top and engage
downwards.

Screw in the towing eye anticlockwise
as far as it will go until it stops in a
horizontal position.
Attach a tow rope – or better still a tow
rod – to the towing eye.

Vehicle care
Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use de-icing agent only when
absolutely necessary, as this has a
degreasing effect and impairs lock
function. After using a de-icing agent,
have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences,
therefore wash your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, we recommend one with
textile brushes and a programme
without wax additives.
When doing a hand wash, use clear
water and a soft brush, cleaning in the
grain direction of the textile hood.
Never use a steam-jet or high-
pressure jet cleaner for the soft top or
the engine compartment.

Screw in the towing eye anticlockwise
as far as it will go until it stops in a
horizontal position.
The lashing eye at the rear
underneath the vehicle must never be
used as a towing eye.
Attach a tow rope – or even better a
tow bar – to the towing eye.
The towing eye must only be used for
towing and not for recovering a
vehicle.

Vehicle care

232
Wax painted parts of the vehicle
regularly.
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint and fabric damage.
If using a vehicle wash, comply with
the vehicle wash manufacturer's
instructions. The windscreen wiper
must be switched off. Remove
additional antenna and external
accessories.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.
Clean bright metal mouldings with a
cleaning solution approved for
aluminium to avoid damage.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of four to nine.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Caution

After washing or cleaning, the soft
top must be completely dried
before opening. If a wet soft top
remains opened for a longer time,
it would be damaged by water
spotting and mould growth.

When cleaning with a high-pressure
jet cleaner ensure a minimum
distance of 30 cm to the rear brand
emblem to prevent unintended
unlocking.
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.

Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax painted parts of the vehicle
regularly (at the latest when water no
longer beads). Otherwise, the
paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Soft top as well as plastic body parts
must not be treated with wax or
polishing agents.

Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Remove dirt residues from smearing
wiper blades by using a soft cloth and
window cleaner. Also make sure to
remove any residues such as wax,
insect residues and similar from the
window.
Ice residues, pollution and continuous
wiping on dry windows will damage or
even destroy the wiper blades.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.

Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.

interior cleaner.
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument cluster and the
displays should only be cleaned using
a soft damp cloth. If necessary use a
weak soap solution.
Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove

Confirmations
Confirmation of service is recorded in
the Service and Warranty Booklet.
The date and mileage is completed
with the stamp and signature of the
servicing workshop.
Make sure that the Service and
Warranty Booklet is completed
correctly as continuous proof of
service is essential if any warranty or
goodwill claims are to be met, and is
also a benefit when selling the
vehicle.
Service interval with remaining
engine oil life duration
The service interval is based on
several parameters depending on
usage.
The service display lets you know
when to change the engine oil.

Damage resulting from the use of
products not in line with these
specifications will not be covered by
the warranty.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil

aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
gasoline and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities must be used.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 240.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 240.

northern countries with very low
temperatures the factory filled coolant
provides frost protection down to
approx. -37 °C. This concentration
should be maintained all year round.
The use of additional coolant
additives that intend to give additional
corrosion protection or seal against
minor leaks can cause function
problems. Liability for consequences
resulting from the use of additional
coolant additives will be rejected.
Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.
AdBlue
Only use AdBlue to reduce the
nitrogen oxides in the exhaust
emission 3 146.

Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information on the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 240.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only organic acid type-long life
coolant (LLC) antifreeze approved for
the vehicle. Consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C. In

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
The vehicle has a number of
sophisticated systems that monitor
and control several vehicle data.
Some data may be stored during
regular operation to facilitate repair of
detected malfunctions, other data is
stored only in a crash or near crash
event by modules in your vehicle
systems that have an event data
recording function such as the airbag
control module.
The systems may record diagnostic
data about the condition of the vehicle
(e.g. oil level or vehicle mileage) and
information how it was operated
(e.g. engine speed, brake application
and seat belt usage).
To read this data, special equipment
and access to the vehicle is required.
Some diagnostic data is electronically
fed into Opel global systems when the
vehicle is serviced in a workshop, in
order to document the service history
of the vehicle. This enables the
