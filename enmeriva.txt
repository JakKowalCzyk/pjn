Front airbag system
The front airbag system consists of
one airbag in the steering wheel and
one in the instrument panel on the
front passenger side. These can be
identified by the word AIRBAG.
The front airbag system is triggered in
the event of a front-end impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and head of
the front seat occupants
considerably.

9 Warning

Optimum protection is only
provided when the seat is in the
proper position.
Seat position 3 37.
Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
Fit the seat belt correctly and
engage securely. Only then is the
airbag able to protect.

on the passenger seat with active
front airbag.

The airbag label is located on both
sides of the front passenger sun visor.

Side airbag system

Seats, restraints

53

Curtain airbag system
The curtain airbag system consists of
an airbag in the roof frame on each
side. This can be identified by the
word AIRBAG on the roof pillars.
The curtain airbag system is triggered
in the event of a side-on impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The side airbag system consists of an
airbag in each front seat backrest.
This can be identified by the word
AIRBAG.
The side airbag system is triggered in
the event of a side impact of a certain
severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and pelvis in
the event of a side-on collision
considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Note
Only use protective seat covers that
have been approved for the vehicle.
Be careful not to cover the airbags.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the head in the event of a
side-on impact considerably.

54

Seats, restraints

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
The hooks in the roof frame are
only suitable for hanging up light
articles of clothing, without coat
hangers. Do not keep any items in
these clothes.
Airbag deactivation
The front passenger airbag system
must be deactivated if a child restraint
system is to be fitted on this seat. The
side airbag and curtain airbag
systems, the belt pretensioners and
all driver airbag systems will remain
active.

The front passenger airbag system
can be deactivated via a key-
operated switch on the right side of
the instrument panel.

Use the ignition key to choose the
position:
* = front passenger airbag is

deactivated and will not inflate in
the event of a collision. Control
indicator * illuminates
continuously in the centre
console. A child restraint
system can be installed in
accordance with the chart Child
restraint installation locations
3 58. No adult person is
allowed to occupy the front
passenger seat.

V = front passenger airbag is active.

A child restraint system must
not be installed.

9 Danger

Risk of fatal injury for a child using
a child restraint system on a seat
with activated front passenger
airbag.
Risk of fatal injury for an adult
person on a seat with deactivated
front passenger airbag.

Control indicator for airbag

Child restraints
Child restraint systems
We recommend the Opel child
restraint system DUO which is
tailored specifically to the vehicle.
When using the Opel child restraint
system DUO, move the rear outboard
seats into position 2 3 42. We
recommend fastening the Opel child
restraint system DUO by using the
following securing systems in
combination:
ISOFIX

If the control indicator V illuminates
for approx. 60 seconds after the
ignition is switched on, the front
passenger airbag system will inflate
in the event of a collision.
If both control indicators are
illuminated at the same time, there is
a system failure. The status of the
system is not discernible, therefore
no person is allowed to occupy the
front passenger seat. Contact a
workshop immediately.
Change status only when the vehicle
is stationary with the ignition off.
Status remains until the next change.

When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.
Always comply with local or national
regulations. In some countries, the
use of child restraint systems is
forbidden on certain seats.

9 Warning

If using a child restraint system on
the front passenger seat, the
airbag system for the front
passenger seat must be
deactivated; if not, the triggering of
the front airbag poses a risk of fatal
injury to the child.
This is especially the case if
rearfacing child restraint systems
are used on the front passenger
seat.

Airbag deactivation 3 54,
Airbag label 3 49.

Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This makes sure that the
child's backbone, which is still very
weak, is under less strain in the event
of an accident.
Suitable are restraint systems that
comply with valid UN ECE
regulations. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct, see following
tables.
Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.

Seats, restraints

57

When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.
Note
Do not stick anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.
A child restraint system which has
been subjected to stress in an
accident must be replaced.

Driving and operating

Stop-start system
The stop-start system helps to save
fuel and to reduce the exhaust
emissions. When conditions allow, it
switches off the engine as soon as the
vehicle is at a low speed or at a
standstill, e.g. at a traffic light or in a
traffic jam. It starts the engine
automatically as soon as the clutch is
depressed. A vehicle battery sensor
ensures that an Autostop is only
performed if the vehicle battery is
sufficiently charged for a restart.
Activation
The stop-start system is available as
soon as the engine is started, the
vehicle starts-off and the conditions
as stated below in this section are
fulfilled.

Deactivation

Deactivate the stop-start system
manually by pressing the eco button.
The deactivation is indicated by the
LED in the button extinguishing.
Autostop
If the vehicle is at a low speed or at a
standstill, activate an Autostop as
follows:
■ Depress the clutch pedal
■ set the lever in neutral
■ release the clutch pedal
The engine will be switched off while
the ignition stays on.

An Autostop is indicated by the
needle at the AUTOSTOP position in
the tachometer.
During an Autostop, the heating and
brake performance will be
maintained.

Caution

The steering assist will be reduced
during an Autostop.

Conditions for an Autostop
The stop-start system checks if each
of the following conditions is fulfilled.

■ The stop-start system is not

manually deactivated

■ the bonnet is fully closed
■ the driver's door is closed or the

driver's seat belt is fastened

■ the vehicle battery is sufficiently
charged and in good condition

■ the engine is warmed up
■ the engine coolant temperature is

not too high

■ the engine exhaust temperature is
not too high, e.g. after driving with
high engine load

■ the ambient temperature is not too

low

■ the defrost selection does not

inhibit an Autostop

■ the climate control system allows

an Autostop

■ the brake vacuum is sufficient
■ the self-cleaning function of the
diesel particle filter is not active
■ the vehicle has moved since the

last Autostop

Otherwise an Autostop will be
inhibited.
An Autostop may become less
available as the ambient temperature
approaches the freezing point.
Certain settings of the climate control
system may inhibit an Autostop. See
Climate control chapter for more
details.
Immediately after motorway driving
an Autostop may be inhibited.
New vehicle running-in 3 136.
Vehicle battery discharge protection

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving without
any notification. The filter is cleaned
by periodically burning off the soot
particles at high temperature. This
process takes place automatically
under set driving conditions and may

take up to 25 minutes. Typically it
needs between 7 and 12 minutes.
Autostop is not available and fuel
consumption may be higher during
this period. The emission of smells
and smoke during this process is
normal.

Under certain driving conditions, e.g.
short distances, the system cannot
clean itself automatically.
If the cleaning of the filter is required
and if previous driving conditions did
not enable automatic cleaning, it will
be indicated by the control indicator

Driving and operating

Caution

It is not advisable to drive with the
hand resting on the selector lever.

ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting off, the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.
Control indicator u 3 96.
Adaptive brake light
During full braking, all three brake
lights flash for the duration of ABS
control.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing your journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.

Fuel
Fuel for petrol engines
Only use unleaded fuel that complies
with European standard EN 228 or
E DIN 51626-1 or equivalent.
Your engine is capable of running
with E10 fuel that fulfills these
standards. E10 fuel contains up to
10 % bioethanol.
Use fuel with the recommended
octane rating 3 225. Use of fuel with
too low an octane rating can reduce
engine power and torque and slightly
increases fuel consumption.

Caution

Do not use fuel or fuel additives
that contain metallic compounds
such as manganese-based
additives. This may cause engine
damage.

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 228 or E DIN 51626-1 or
equivalent can lead to deposits or
engine damage and loss of
warranty.

Caution

Use of fuel with too low an octane
rating could lead to uncontrolled
combustion and engine damage.
Fuel for diesel engines
Only use diesel fuel that complies
with EN 590.
In countries outside the European
Union use Euro-Diesel fuel with a
sulfur concentration below 50 ppm.

The boiling point depends on the
pressure and mixing ratio. At ambient
pressure, it is between -42 °C (pure
propane) and -0.5 °C (pure butane).

Caution

The system works at an ambient
temperature of approx. -8 °C to
100 °C.

Full function of the LPG system can
only be guaranteed with liquid gas
which complies with the minimum
requirements of DIN EN 589.
Fuel selector

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 590 or similar can lead to
engine powerloss, increased wear
or engine damage and may affect
your warranty.

Do not use marine diesel oils, heating
oils, Aquazole and similar diesel-
water emulsions. Diesel fuels must
not be diluted with fuels for petrol
engines.

Fuel for liquid gas
operation
Liquid gas is known as LPG
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas) or under
its French name GPL (Gaz de Pétrole
Liquéfié). LPG is also known as
Autogas.
LPG consists mainly of propane and
butane. The octane rating is between
105 and 115, depending on the
butane proportion. LPG is stored
liquid at around 5 - 10 bar pressure.

maintain fuel quality and system
function for petrol operation.

158

Driving and operating

Fill the tank completely at regular
intervals to prevent corrosion in the
tank.
Faults and remedies
If gas mode is not possible, check the
following:
■ Is there enough liquid gas present?
■ Is there enough petrol present for

starting?

Due to extreme temperatures in
combination with the gas
composition, it may take slightly
longer before the system switches
from petrol to liquid gas mode.
In extreme situations, the system may
also switch back to petrol mode if the
minimum requirements are not
fulfilled.
Seek the assistance of a workshop in
the event of all other faults.

Caution

Repairs and adjustments may only
be made by trained specialists in
order to maintain the safety and
warranty on the LPG system.

Liquid gas is given a particular odour
(odorised) so that any leaks can be
detected easily.

9 Warning

If you smell gas in the vehicle or in
the immediate vicinity, switch to
petrol mode immediately. No

the model Opel Meriva is within a
range of 7.4 to 3.7 l/100 km.
The CO2 emission (combined) is
within a range of 169 to 99 g/km.
For the values specific for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
General information
The official fuel consumption and
specific CO2 emission figures quoted
relate to the EU base model with

Trailer hitch
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.
Fitting of towing equipment could
cover the opening of the towing eye.
If this is the case use the coupling ball
bar for towing. Always keep the
coupling ball bar in the vehicle.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements.
For trailers with low driving stability
and caravan trailers with a permitted
gross vehicle weight of more than

1100 kg the use of a stabiliser is
strongly recommended when driving
above 80 km/h.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 233.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads

9 Warning

Vehicles with engine A13DTE:
Use of towing equipment is
permissible for attaching
compatible bicycle carriers only.
Do not use towing equipment for
trailer towing.

Driving and operating

163

The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12 %.
The permitted trailer load applies up
to the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10 %
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8 %, e.g. motorways).

164

Driving and operating

The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 221.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (75 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.

Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) may be exceeded by
80 kg (vehicles with LPG system:
110 kg), the gross vehicle weight
rating may be exceeded by 70 kg
(vehicles with LPG system: 95 kg). If
the permissible rear axle load is
exceeded, a maximum speed of
100 km/h applies.

Tyre pressure 3 233 and refer to the
label on the front passenger door.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.

Vehicle care

Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options. For the correct tyre
pressure value, follow the procedure
below:
1. Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 225.

2. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 233.
For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased on a vehicle with tyre
pressure monitoring system, switch
off ignition.

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The tyre pressure monitoring system
(TPMS) checks the pressure of all
four wheels once a minute when
vehicle speed exceeds a certain limit.

Caution

Tyre pressure monitoring system
warns only about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.

Note
In countries where the tyre pressure
monitoring system is legally
required, the use of wheels without
pressure sensors will invalidate the
vehicle type approval.
The current tyre pressures can be
shown in the Vehicle Information
Menu in the Driver Information Centre
(DIC).
The menu can be selected by the
buttons on the turn signal lever.

Press the MENU button to select the
Vehicle Information Menu X.

TPMS Sensor Matching
Process
Each TPMS sensor has a unique
identification code. The identification
code must be matched to a new tyre/
wheel position after rotating the tyres
or exchanging the complete wheel set
and if one or more TPMS sensors
were replaced. The TPMS sensor
matching process should also be
performed after replacing a spare tyre
with a road tyre containing the TPMS
sensor.
The malfunction light and the warning
message or code should go off at the
next ignition cycle. The sensors are
matched to the tyre/wheel positions,
using a TPMS relearn tool, in the
following order: left side front tyre,
right side front tyre, right side rear tyre

and left side rear tyre. The turn light
at the current active position is
illuminated until sensor is matched.
Consult your workshop for service or
to purchase a relearn tool. There are
two minutes to match the first tyre/
wheel position, and five minutes
overall to match all four tyre/wheel
positions. If it takes longer, the
matching process stops and must be
restarted.
The TPMS sensor matching process
is:
1. Apply the parking brake; on

vehicles with automatic
transmission set the selector lever
to P.

2. Turn the ignition on.
3. Use the MENU button on the turn
signal lever to select the Vehicle
Information Menu in the Driver
Information Centre (DIC).

4. Turn the adjuster wheel to scroll to

the tyre pressure menu.

5. Press the SET/CLR button to

begin the sensor matching
process. A message requesting
acceptance of the process should
display.

6. Press the SET/CLR button again
to confirm the selection. The horn
sounds twice to signal the
receiver is in relearn mode.

7. Start with the left side front tyre.
8. Place the relearn tool against the
tyre sidewall, near the valve stem.
Then press the button to activate
the TPMS sensor. A horn chirp
confirms that the sensor
identification code has been
matched to this tyre and wheel
position.

9. Proceed to the right side front tyre,

and repeat the procedure in
Step 8.

10. Proceed to the right side rear tyre,

and repeat the procedure in
Step 8.

11. Proceed to the left side rear tyre,

and repeat the procedure in
Step 8. The horn sounds twice to

indicate the sensor identification
code has been matched to the left
side rear tyre, and the TPMS
sensor matching process is no
longer active.

12. Turn off the ignition.
13. Set all four tyres to the

recommended air pressure level
as indicated on the tyre pressure
label.

14. Ensure the tyre loading status is
set according selected pressure
3 100.

Temperature dependency
Tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase.
The tyre pressure value displayed in
the Driver Information Centre shows
the actual tyre pressure. Therefore it
is important to check tyre pressure
with cold tyres.

Vehicle care

197

Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.
Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons it is recommended
that the tread depth of the tyres on
one axle should not vary by more than
2 mm.

If there is more wear at the front than
the rear, swap round front wheels and
rear wheels periodically. Ensure that
the direction of rotation of the wheels
remains the same.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every 6 years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and make other vehicle
modifications.
After converting to a different tyre
size, have the label with tyre
pressures replaced.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheels
may lead to accidents and will
invalidate the vehicle type
approval.
Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.

Vehicles with steel wheels: When
using locking wheel nuts, the wheel
covers might not be attached to the

cleaner.

Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Plastic body parts must not be treated
with wax or polishing agents.

Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with a
soft cloth and window cleaner.
Moonroof
Never clean with solvents or abrasive
agents, fuels, aggressive media (e.g.
paint cleaner, acetone-containing
solutions etc.), acidic or highly
alkaline media or abrasive pads. Do
not apply wax or polishing agents to
the middle part of the moonroof.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.

Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.

Liquid gas system

9 Danger

Liquid gas is heavier than air and
can collect in sink points.
Take care when performing work
at the underbody in a pit.

For painting work and when using a
drying booth at a temperature above
60 °C, the liquid gas tank must be
removed.
Do not make any modifications to the
liquid gas system.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Rear carrier system
Clean the rear carrier system with a
steam-jet or high-pressure jet cleaner
at least once a year.
Operate the rear carrier system
periodically if not in regular use, in
particular during winter.

216

Vehicle care

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument cluster and the
displays should only be cleaned using
a soft damp cloth. If necessary use a
weak soap solution.
Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-
coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, like zips or
belts or studded jeans.

Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

General information
Service information
In order to ensure economical and
safe vehicle operation and to
maintain the value of your vehicle, it
is of vital importance that all
maintenance work is carried out at the
proper intervals as specified.
The detailed, up-to-date service
schedule for your vehicle is available
at the workshop.
Service display 3 91.
European service intervals
Maintenance of your vehicle is
required every 30000 km or after
1 year, whichever occurs first, unless
otherwise indicated in the service
display.
A shorter service interval can be valid
for severe driving behaviour, e.g. for
taxis and police vehicles.
The European service intervals are
valid for the following countries:

Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Greenland, Hungary,

Confirmations
Confirmation of service is recorded in
the Service and Warranty Booklet.
The date and mileage is completed
with the stamp and signature of the
servicing workshop.
Make sure that the Service and
Warranty Booklet is completed
correctly as continuous proof of
service is essential if any warranty or
goodwill claims are to be met, and is
also a benefit when selling the
vehicle.
Service interval with remaining
engine oil life duration
The service interval is based on
several parameters depending on
usage.
The service display lets you know
when to change the engine oil.
Service display 3 91.

Recommended fluids,

Recommended fluids and
lubricants
Only use products that meet the
recommended specifications.
Damage resulting from the use of
products not compliant with these
specifications will not be covered by
the warranty.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil

aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
gasoline and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities have to be used.
Recommendations for gasoline
engines are also valid for
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG),
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and
Ethanol (E85) fuelled engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 222.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.

Service and maintenance

219

Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 222.
Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 222.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.

Coolant and antifreeze
Use only organic acid type-long life
coolant (LLC) antifreeze approved for
the vehicle. Consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C. In
northern countries with very low
temperatures the factory filled coolant
provides frost protection down to
approx. -37°C. This concentration
should be maintained all year round.
The use of additional coolant
additives that intend to give additional
corrosion protection or seal against
minor leaks can cause function
problems. Liability for consequences
resulting from the use of additional
coolant additives will be rejected.
Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.

To identify the respective engine,
refer to the engine power in the EEC
Certificate of Conformity provided
with your vehicle or other national
registration documents.

The identification plate is located on
the rear right-hand door frame.

The combined total of front and rear
axle loads must not exceed the
permissible gross vehicle weight. For
example, if the front axle is bearing its
maximum permissible load, the rear
axle can only bear a load that is equal
to the gross vehicle weight minus the
front axle load.
The technical data is determined in
accordance with European
Community standards. We reserve

Customer information

237

When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
■ Operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels)

■ Status messages of the vehicle and
its single components (e.g. number
of wheel revolutions / rotational
speed, deceleration, lateral
acceleration)

■ Dysfunctions and defects in

important system components

■ Vehicle reactions in particular

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the stability
regulation system)

■ Environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature)

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimizing vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

Customer information

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
deflation detection and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
