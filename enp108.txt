.OverviewSwitch off the headlamps and front foglamps 
when the ambient light level does not require 
their use.

Avoid running the engine before moving off, 
particularly in winter; your vehicle will warm up 
much faster while driving.

As a passenger, if you avoid connecting your 
multimedia devices (film, music, video game, 
etc.), you will contribute towards limiting the 
consumption of electrical energy, and so of 
fuel.
Disconnect your portable devices before 
leaving the vehicle.

Eco-driving

Eco-driving is a range of everyday practices 
that allow the motorist to optimise their fuel 
consumption and CO2 emissions.

Optimise the use of your 
gearbox
With a manual gearbox, move off gently 
and change up without waiting. During 
acceleration change up early.

With an ETG gearbox, give preference to 
automatic mode (Easy) and avoid pressing the 
accelerator pedal heavily or suddenly.

The gear shift indicator invites you to engage 
the most suitable gear: as soon as the 
indication is displayed in the instrument panel, 
follow it straight away.
For vehicles fitted with an ETG gearbox, this 
indicator only appears in manual mode.

Drive smoothly
Maintain a safe distance between vehicles, 
use engine braking rather than the 
brake pedal, and press the accelerator 
progressively. These practices contribute 
towards a reduction in fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions and also help reduce the 
background traffic noise.

Control the use of your electrical 
equipment
Before moving off, if the passenger 
compartment is too warm, ventilate it by 
opening the windows and air vents before 
using the air conditioning.
Above 30 mph (50 km/h), close the windows 
and leave the air vents open.
Consider using equipment that can help 
keep the temperature in the passenger 
compartment down (sunroof and window 
blinds…).
Unless it has automatic regulation, switch off 
the air conditioning as soon as the desired 
temperature has been reached.
Switch off the demisting and defrosting 
controls, if not automatic.
Switch off the heated seat as soon as 
possible.

6

Eco-drivingDo not forget the spare wheel and the tyres on 
any trailer or caravan.

Have your vehicle serviced regularly (engine 
oil, oil filter, air filter, passenger compartment 
filter…) and observe the schedule of 
operations recommended in the warranty and 
maintenance record.

Limit the causes of excess 
consumption
Spread loads throughout the vehicle; place 
the heaviest items in the bottom of the boot, 
as close as possible to the rear seats.
Limit the loads carried in the vehicle and 
reduce wind resistance (roof bars, roof rack, 
…). Use a roof box in preference.
Remove roof bars and the roof rack after use.

At the end of winter, remove winter tyres and 
refit your summer tyres.

Observe the recommendations 
on maintenance
Check the tyre pressures regularly, when cold, 
referring to the label in the door aperture, 
driver's side.
Carry out this check in particular:
- 
- 
- 

before a long journey,
at each change of season,
after a long period out of use.

Warning lamps
Displayed as symbols, visual indicators 
which inform the driver of the occurrence 
of a malfunction (warning lamps) or of the 
operating status of a system (operation or 
deactivation indicator lamps). Certain lamps 
light up in two ways (fixed or flashing) and/or in 
several colours.

Associated warnings
The illumination of a lamp can be accompanied 
by an audible signal and/or a message 
displayed in a screen.
Relating the type of alert to the operating status 
of the vehicle allows you to determine whether 
the situation is normal or a fault has occurred: 
refer to the description of each lamp for further 
information.

When the ignition is switched on
Certain red or orange warning lamps come on 
for a few seconds when the ignition is switched 
on. These warning lamps should go off as soon 
as the engine is started.

For more information on equipment or 
a function, refer to the corresponding section.

1InstrumentsPersistent warning lamp
When the engine is running or the vehicle is 
being driven, the illumination of a red or orange 
warning lamp indicates a fault that needs 
further investigation, using any associated 
message and the description of the warning 
lamp in the documentation.

Where a warning lamp remains lit
The references (1) (2) and (3) in the warning 
and indicator lamp description indicate whether 
you should contact a qualified professional 
in addition to the immediate recommended 
actions.

(1 ): You must stop as soon as it is safe to 
do so and switch off the ignition.

(2): Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

(3): Go to a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

it difficult for the emergency services to 
enter the vehicle in an emergency.
As a safety precaution (with children on 
board), remove the key from the ignition or 
take the electronic key when you leave the 
vehicle, even for a short time.

Lost keys, remote control, electronic 
key
Visit a PEUGEOT dealer with the vehicle's 
registration certificate, your personal 
identification documents and if possible, 
the label bearing the key code.
The PEUGEOT dealer will be able to look 
up the key code and the transponder code 
required to order a new key.

Purchasing a second-hand vehicle

Do not sit or place anything on the 
crossbar of the roof when it is open.
To avoid damaging the roof, do not open it 
if there is snow or ice present.
Never use sharp tools to remove snow or 
ice that has built up on the roof.
To prevent creases appearing in the 
canvas, it is recommended not to leave 
the roof open for long periods.
It is not recommended to operate the 
vehicle's air conditioning system when the 
roof is open.

Advice on care
General recommendations on the care and 
maintenance of your vehicle are given in the 
warranty and maintenance record.

Fabric roof

For regular care of the fabric and to keep 
its original appearance, we recommend 
using the environmentally friendly product 
"Insect removal" product" from the 
"TECHNATURE" range. To obtain this 
product, visit a PEUGEOT dealer.

Before washing the fabric, remove as 
much dirt as possible using a soft brush or 
a vacuum cleaner.

Never use chemical products, detergents, 
stain removers, solvents, alcohol, petrol,… 
to clean the fabric.

To avoid damaging the roof:
-  never use a high-pressure washer,
-  never clean your vehicle in an 

automatic roller-brush car wash.

To waterproof the fabric, use only 
waterproofing products specifically for 
fabric hoods.

If the vehicle is to be parked outside for 
a long period, it is advisable to protect the 
roof using a tarpaulin.
It is advisable to close the roof when you 
park the vehicle.
Even if the roof is closed, it is safer not to 
leave any valuables inside the vehicle.
When you leave the vehicle, turn off 
the ignition and remove the key (or take 
the electronic key with you) to prevent 
unintentional operation of the roof.

Allow the vehicle to dry in the shade and 
avoid exposing it to direct sunlight.

Acoustic air deflector

We recommend that you clean the 
acoustic air deflector with care, using 
a soft brush.

To remove stains, dab them (never rub 
them) with a sponge and some soapy 
water, then immediately rinse the fabric 
with clean water.

Immediately remove bird droppings or 
plant resins, their caustic nature could 
damage the fabric.

31

2AccessFront seats

For safety reasons, only adjust seats 
when the vehicle is stationary.

Before moving the seat backwards, 
ensure that there is nothing that might 
prevent the full travel of the seat.
There is a risk of trapping or pinching 
passengers if present in the rear seats 
or jamming the seat if large objects are 
placed on the floor behind the seat.

Correct driving position
Before taking to the road and to make the most 
of the ergonomic layout of the instruments and 
controls, carry out these adjustments in the 
following order:
- 
- 
- 
- 
-

Recommendations 
for ventilation and air 
conditioning

If the interior temperature is very high after 
the vehicle has stood for a long time in the 
sunshine, please ventilate the passenger 
compartment for a few moments.
To obtain a perfectly even distribution 
of air, ensure that the external air intake 
grille, the air vents, air passages and 
the air outlets in the footwells are not 
obstructed.
Ensure that the passenger compartment 
filter, situated behind the glove box, 
inside the air conditioning unit, is in good 
condition. Replace the filter elements 
periodically. If you drive in a dusty 
environment, have them replaced twice 
as often.
Operate the air conditioning system for 
5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a month, to 
keep it in perfect working order.
To ensure correct operation of your air 
conditioning system, we also advise you to 
have it checked regularly.
If the system does not produce cold air, do 
not use it and contact a PEUGEOT dealer 
or a qualified workshop.

Ease of use and comfortThe condensation created by the air 
conditioning results in a discharge of water

Lighting and visibilityGeneral safety 
recommendations

Labels are affixed in different locations on 
your vehicle. They include safety warnings 
and vehicle identification information. Do 
not remove them: they are an integral part 
of your vehicle.

For any work on your vehicle, use 
a qualified workshop that has the technical 
information, skills and equipment required, 
all of which a PEUGEOT dealer is able to 
provide.

Depending on country regulations, some 
safety equipment may be compulsory: 
high visibility safety vests, warning 
triangles, breathalysers, spare bulbs, 
spare fuses, fire extinguisher, first aid kit, 
mud flaps at the rear of the vehicle, etc.

We draw your attention to the following 
points:
-  The fitting of electrical equipment 

or accessories not approved by 
PEUGEOT may cause excessive 
current consumption and faults and 
failures with the electrical system of 
your vehicle. Contact a PEUGEOT 
dealer for information on the range of 
recommended accessories.

-  As a safety measure, access to 

the diagnostic socket, used for the 
vehicle's electronic systems, is 
reserved strictly for PEUGEOT dealers 
or qualified workshop, equipped 
with the special tools required (risk 
of malfunctions of the vehicle's 
electronic systems that could cause 
breakdowns or serious accidents). 
The manufacturer cannot be held 
responsible if this advice is not 
followed.

-  Any modification or adaptation not 

intended or authorised by PEUGEOT 
or carried out without meeting the 
technical requirements defined by 
the manufacturer will result in the 
suspension of the legal and contractual 
warranties.

Installation of accessory radio 
communication transmitters
Before installing a radio communication 
transmitter, you must contact a PEUGEOT 
dealer for the specification of transmitters 
which can be fitted (frequency, maximum

Definitions
Anti-lock braking system (ABS) 
and electronic brake force 
distribution (EBFD)
These systems improve the stability and 
manoeuvrability of your vehicle when braking 
and contribute towards improved control on 
corners, in particular on poor or slippery road 
surfaces.
ABS prevents the wheels from locking during 
emergency braking.
EBFD ensures total management of the braking 
pressure, wheel by wheel.

Emergency braking assistance 
(EBA)
In an emergency, this system permits the 
optimum braking pressure to be reached 
more quickly, therefore reducing the stopping 
distance.
It triggers according to the speed at which 
the brake pedal is pressed. This is felt by 
a reduction in the resistance of the pedal and 
an increase in the effectiveness of the braking.

Traction control (TRC)
This system optimises traction in order to limit 
wheel slip by acting on the brakes of the driving 
wheels and on the engine. It also improves 
the directional stability of the vehicle on 
acceleration.

Dynamic stability control (DSC)
If there is a difference between the path 
followed by the vehicle and that required by the 
driver, this system monitors each wheel and 
automatically acts on the brake of one or more 
wheels and on the engine to return the vehicle 
to the required path, within the limits of the laws 
of physics.

Operation
Anti-lock braking system (ABS) 
and electronic brake force

braking.

You must stop as soon as it is safe to do so.
Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop without delay.

When changing wheels (tyres and rims), 
ensure that these are approved for your 
vehicle.
When operating under normal conditions, 
the ABS may cause the brake pedal to 
vibrate slightly.

In emergency braking, press the brake 
pedal hard and maintain this pressure.

Activation of these systems 
is signalled by flashing of this 
indicator in the instrument panel, 
accompanied by an audible signal 
for the DSC system.

Deactivation

In exceptional conditions (moving a vehicle that 
is bogged down in mud, stuck in snow, on loose 
soil, …), it may prove useful to deactivate the 
DSC and TRC systems, so that the wheels can 
move freely and regain grip.
It is recommended that the systems are

seat belt.

Locking

The front seat belts are fitted with 
a pretensioning and force limiting system.
This system improves safety in the front 
seats in the event of a front or side impact. 
Depending on the severity of the impact, the 
pretensioning system instantly tightens the seat 
belts against the body of the occupants.
The pretensioning seat belts are active when 
the ignition is on.
The force limiter reduces the pressure of 
the seat belt on the passenger's chest, thus 
improving their protection.

Advice
The driver must ensure that passengers 
use the seat belts correctly and that they 
are all fastened before setting off.
Wherever you are seated in the vehicle, 
always fasten your seat belt, even for 
short journeys.
Do not interchange the seat belt buckles 
as they will not fulfil their role fully.
The seat belts are fitted with an inertia 
reel permitting automatic adjustment of 
the length of the strap to your size. The 
seat belt is stowed automatically when not 
in use.
Before and after use, ensure that the seat 
belt is reeled in correctly.
The lower part of the strap must be 
positioned as low as possible on the 
pelvis.
The upper part must be positioned in the 
hollow of the shoulder.
The inertia reels have an automatic 
locking device at the time of a collision, 
during sudden braking or if the vehicle 
turns over. You can release the device by 
pulling the strap firmly and then releasing 
it so that it reels in slightly.

55

5SafetyAdvice
In order to be effective, a seat belt must:
-  be tightened as close to the body as 

possible,

-  be pulled in front of you with a smooth 

movement, checking that it does not 
twist,

-  be used to restrain only one person,
-  not show any signs of cuts or fraying,
-  not be converted or modified to avoid 

affecting its performance.

In accordance with current safety 
regulations, for all repairs on your 
vehicle's seat belts, go to a qualified 
workshop with the skills and equipment 
needed, which a PEUGEOT dealer is able 
to provide.
Have your seat belts checked regularly 
by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop, particularly if the straps show 
signs of damage.
Clean the seat belt straps with soapy 
water or a textile cleaning product, sold by 
PEUGEOT dealers.
After folding or moving a seat or rear 
bench seat, ensure that the seat belt is 
positioned and reeled in correctly.

56

Instructions for children
Use a suitable child seat, if the passenger 
is less than 12 years old or shorter than 
one and a half metres.
Never use the same seat belt to secure 
more than one person.
Never allow a child to travel on your lap.
For more information on Child seats, refer 
to the corresponding section.

In case of impact
Depending on the nature and 
seriousness of the impact, the 
pyrotechnic system may be deployed 
before and independent of the airbags. 
Deployment of the pretensioners is 
accompanied by a slight discharge of 
harmless smoke and a noise, due to the 
activation of the pyrotechnic cartridge 
incorporated in the system.
In all cases, the airbag warning lamp is lit.
After an impact, get the seat belt system 
checked and if necessary have it replaced 
by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

Airbags
Designed to contribute to the safety of the 
occupants in case of violent collisions. The 
airbags supplement the action of the force-
limiting seat belts.
If a collision occurs, the electronic detectors 
record and analyse the front and side impacts 
sustained in the impact detection zones:
- 

In the event of violent impact, the 
airbags are deployed instantly and help 
better protect occupants of the vehicle; 
immediately after the impact, the airbags 
deflate rapidly in order not to hinder 
the visibility or the possible exit of the 
occupants.
In the event of a slight impact, an impact 
at the rear of the vehicle and under certain 
conditions of rollover, the airbags may not 
deploy; only the seat belt helps to protect 
you in these situations.

The airbags do not operate when the 
ignition is switched off.
This equipment will only deploy once. If 
a second impact occurs (during the same 
or a subsequent accident), the airbag will 
not be deployed again.

SafetyImpact detection zones

Front airbags

Operating fault

A. Front impact zone.
B. Side impact zone.

The deployment of an airbag is 
accompanied by a slight emission of 
smoke and a noise, due to the detonation 
of the pyrotechnic charge incorporated in 
the system.
This smoke is not harmful, but sensitive 
individuals may experience slight irritation.
The detonation noise associated with the 
deployment of an airbag may result in 
a slight loss of hearing for a short time.

This system protects the driver and front 
passenger in the event of a severe frontal 
impact in order to limit the risk of injury to the 
head and chest.
The driver's airbag is fitted in the centre of the 
steering wheel; the front passenger's airbag is 
fitted in the dashboard above the glove box.

Deployment
The airbags are deployed, except the 
passenger's front airbag if it is deactivated, in 
the event of a serious front impact to all or part 
of the front impact zone A, in the longitudinal 
centreline of the vehicle on a horizontal plane 
and directed from the front to the rear of the 
vehicle.
The front airbag inflates between the thorax 
and head of the front occupant of the vehicle 
and the steering wheel, driver's side, and the 
dashboard, passenger's side, to cushion their 
forward movement.

If this warning lamp comes on in 
the instrument panel it indicates 
a malfunction of the airbags. Contact 
a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop as soon as possible to 
have the system checked. The 
airbags may no longer be deployed 
in the event of a serious impact.

If this is the case, do not install a child seat nor 
allow a passenger to sit in the front passenger seat.

Lateral airbags

System which protects the driver and front 
passenger in the event of a serious side impact 
in order to limit the risk of injury to the chest, 
between the hip and the shoulder.
Each lateral airbag is fitted in the seat backrest 
frame, door side.

57

5SafetyDeployment
The lateral airbag is deployed unilaterally in the 
event of a serious side impact applied to all or 
part of the side impact zone B, perpendicular 
to the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle 
on a horizontal plane and directed from the 
outside towards the inside of the vehicle.
The lateral airbag inflates between the hip and 
shoulder of the front occupant of the vehicle 
and the corresponding door trim panel.

Curtain airbags
System contributing towards greater protection 
for the driver and passengers in the event of 
a serious side impact in order to limit the risk of 
injury to the side of the head.
Each curtain airbag is built into the pillars and 
the upper passenger compartment area.

Deployment
The curtain airbag is deployed at the same 
time as the corresponding lateral airbag in the 
event of a serious side impact applied to all or 
part of the side impact zone B, perpendicular 
to the longitudinal centreline of the vehicle 
on a horizontal plane and directed from the 
outside towards the inside of the vehicle.
The curtain airbag inflates between the front or 
rear occupant of the vehicle and the windows.

Operating fault

Advice

If this warning lamp on the 
instrument panel comes on, contact 
a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system 
checked. The airbags may no longer 
be deployed in the event of a serious 
impact.

In the event of a minor impact or bump on 
the side of the vehicle or if the vehicle rolls 
over, the airbags may not be deployed.
In the event of a rear or front collision, 
none of the lateral airbags are deployed.

For the airbags to be fully effective, 
observe the safety recommendations 
below.
Adopt a normal and upright sitting 
position.
Fasten your seat belt, ensuring it is 
positioned correctly.
Do not leave anything between the 
occupants and the airbags (a child, pet, 
object, etc.), nor fix or attach anything 
close to or in the way of the airbag release 
trajectory; this could cause injuries during 
their deployment.
Never modify the original definition of your 
vehicle, particularly in the area directly 
around the airbags.
After an accident or if the vehicle has 
been stolen or broken into, have the 
airbag systems checked.
All work on the airbag system must be 
carried out by a PEUGEOT dealer or 
a qualified workshop.
Even if all of the precautions mentioned 
are observed, a risk of injury or of minor 
burns to the head, chest or arms when an 
airbag is deployed cannot be ruled out. 
The airbag inflates almost instantly (within 
a few milliseconds) then deflates within 
the same time discharging the hot gas via 
openings provided for this purpose.

SafetyFront airbags
Do not drive holding the steering wheel 
by its spokes or resting your hands on the 
centre part of the wheel.
Passengers must not place their feet on 
the dashboard.
Do not smoke as deployment of the 
airbags can cause burns or the risk of 
injury from a cigarette or pipe.
Never remove or pierce the steering wheel 
or hit it violently.
Do not fit or attach anything to the steering 
wheel or dashboard, this could cause 
injuries with deployment of the airbags.

Curtain airbags
Do not attach anything or hang anything to 
the roof, as this could cause head injuries 
when the curtain airbag is deployed.
If fitted to your vehicle, do not remove the 
grab handles installed on the roof, they 
play a part in securing the curtain airbags.

Lateral airbags
Use only approved covers on the seats, 
compatible with the deployment of the 
lateral airbags. For information on the 
product range of seat covers suitable for 
your vehicle, contact a PEUGEOT dealer.
Do not attach anything to or hang anything 
from the seat backrests (clothes, etc.) as 
this could cause injuries to the thorax or 
arm when the lateral airbag is deployed.
Do not sit with the upper part of the body 
any nearer to the door than necessary.

General points relating to 
child seats

The regulations on carrying children are 
specific to each country. Refer to the 
legislation in force in your country.

For maximum safety, please observe the 
following recommendations:
- 

In accordance with European regulations, 
all children under the age of 12 or less 
than one and a half metres tall must 
travel in approved child seats suited to 
their weight, on seats fitted with a seat belt 
or ISOFIX mountings.

-  Statistically, the safest seats in your 

vehicle for carrying children are the rear 
seats.

-  A child weighing less than 9 kg must 
travel in the rearward-facing position 
both in the front and in the rear.

It is recommended that children travel on 
the rear seats of your vehicle:
- 
- 

"rearward facing" up to the age of 3,
"forward facing" over the age of 3.

Ensure that the seat belt is positioned and 
tightened correctly.
For child seats with a support leg, ensure 
that the latter is in firm and steady contact 
with the floor.
In the front: if necessary, adjust the 
passenger seat.
At the rear: if necessary, adjust the 
relevant front seat.

59

5SafetyChild seat at the front
"Rearward facing"

Passenger seat adjusted to the rearmost 
longitudinal position.

When a "rearward facing" child seat is installed 
on the front passenger seat, adjust the 
vehicle's seat to the rearmost longitudinal 
position, with the backrest straightened.

Deactivating the front 
passenger airbag

The front passenger airbag must be 
deactivated, without exception. Otherwise, 
the child risks being seriously injured 
or killed if the airbag is deployed.

Never install a rearward facing child 
restraint system on a seat protected by an 
active front airbag. This could cause the 
death of the child or serious injury.

The warning label present on both sides of the 
passenger sun visor repeats this advice.
In line with current legislation, the following 
tables contain this warning in all of the 
languages required.

Passenger airbag OFF 

"Forward facing"

When a "forward facing" child seat is installed 
on the front passenger seat, adjust the 
vehicle's seat to the rearmost longitudinal 
position with seat backrest straightened and 
leave the front passenger airbag activated.

60

For more information on the Airbags, 
refer to the corresponding section.

SafetyDeactivating the 
passenger's front airbag

Only the passenger's front airbag can be 
deactivated.
F  With the ignition off, introduce the key into 

the passenger airbag deactivation switch.

F  Turn it to the OFF position.
F  Remove the key keeping the switch in this 

position.

When the ignition is switched on, 
this warning lamp lights up in the 
seat belt and front airbag warning 
lamps display screen. It stays on 
while the airbag is deactivated.

To ensure the safety of your child, 
the passenger's front airbag must be 
deactivated when you install a rearward 
facing child seat on the front passenger 
seat.
Otherwise, the child would risk being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag 
were deployed.

Reactivating the 
passenger's front airbag
When you remove a rearward facing child seat, 
with the ignition off, turn the switch to the ON 
position to reactivate the airbag and so ensure 
the safety of your front passenger in the event 
of an impact.

When the ignition is switched on, 
this warning lamp comes on in the 
display of warnings for the seat belts 
and front passenger airbag. It stays 
on for as long as the front passenger 
airbag is activated.

ISOFIX mountings
The seats shown below are fitted with 
regulation ISOFIX mounting:

There are three anchorages for each seat:

- 

two anchorages A, located between the 
backrest and cushion of the vehicle seat, 
indicated by a marking,

- 

This ISOFIX mounting system ensures fast, 
reliable and safe fitting of the child seat in your 
vehicle.
ISOFIX child seats are fitted with two locks 
that are anchored on both anchors A.
Some seats also feature a top tether that will 
be attached to the anchor B.
To secure the child seat using the TOP 
TETHER:
- 

remove and store the head restraint before 
installing the child seat on this seat (refit it 
once the child seat has been removed),
run the strap of the child seat behind the top 
of the seat backrest, centring it between the 
holes for the head restraint rods,

-  secure the clip of the top tether to the 

anchorage B,
tighten the upper strap.

- 

-  an anchorage B behind the seat for fixing 

the upper strap, referred to as the TOP 
TETHER. It is indicated by a marking.

The TOP TETHER secures the upper strap of 
child seats that have them. In case of frontal 
impact, this device limits the tilting of the child 
seat forward.

The incorrect installation of a child seat in 
a vehicle compromises the protection of 
the child in the event of an accident.

Strictly follow the fitting instructions 
provided in the installation guide supplied 
with the child seat.

Advice

The incorrect installation of a child seat in 
a vehicle compromises the protection of 
the child in the event of an accident.
Ensure that there is no seat belt or seat 
belt buckle under the child seat, as this 
could destabilise it.
Remember to fasten the seat belts or the 
child seat harnesses keeping the slack 
relative to the child's body to a minimum, 
even for short journeys.
When installing a child seat using the seat 
belt, ensure that the seat belt is tightened 
correctly on the child seat and that it 
secures the child seat firmly on the seat 
of your vehicle. If your passenger seat is 
adjustable, move it forwards if necessary.
The head restraint must be removed 
before installing a child seat with 
a backrest on a passenger seat.
Ensure that the head restraint is stored or 
attached securely to prevent it from being 
thrown around the vehicle in the event 
of sharp braking. Refit the head restraint 
when the child seat is removed.

SafetyChildren at the rear
At rear seating positions, always leave 
sufficient space between the front seat 
and:
-  a "rearward facing" child seat,
- 

the child's feet for a child seat fitted 
forward facing.

To do this, move the front seat forwards 
and, if necessary, move its backrest into 
the upright position.
For optimal installation of the forward 
facing child seat, verify that its backrest is 
as close as possible to the backrest of the 
vehicle seat, if possible in contact with it.

Children at the front
The legislation on carrying children on the 
front passenger seat is specific to each 
country. Refer to the legislation in force in 
the country in which you are driving.
Deactivate the front passenger airbag 
when a "rearward facing" child seat is 
installed on the front passenger seats.
Otherwise, there is a risk of serious or 
fatal injury to the child if the airbag is 
deployed.

Installing a booster seat
The chest part of the seat belt must be 
positioned on the child's shoulder without 
touching the neck.
Ensure that the lap part of the seat belt 
passes correctly over the child's thighs.
We recommend using a booster seat with 
a backrest, equipped with a belt guide at 
shoulder level.

Additional protections
To prevent accidental opening of the doors 
and rear windows, use the child lock.
Take care not to open the rear windows by 
more than one third.
To protect young children from the rays 
of the sun, fit side blinds on the rear 
windows.
As a safety precaution, do not leave:
-  a child or children alone and 

unattended in a vehicle,

-  a child or an animal in a vehicle 

which is exposed to the sun, with the 
windows closed,
the keys within reach of children inside 
the vehicle.

- 

Child lock

This prevents the rear doors from being opened 
from the inside.
The control is located on the edge of each rear 
door.
F  Lower the control lever.
Check the status of this safety feature each 
time before you switch on the ignition.
This system is independent of the central 
locking.

71

5SafetyDriving advice
Observe driving regulations and remain vigilant 
whatever the traffic conditions.
Pay close attention to the traffic and keep your 
hands on the wheel so that you are ready to 
react at any time to any eventuality.
As a safety measure, the driver should only 
carry out any operations that require close 
attention when the vehicle is stationary.
On a long journey, taking a break every two 
hours is strongly recommended.
In difficult weather, drive smoothly, anticipate 
the need to brake and increase the distance 
from other vehicles.

Important!

Never drive with the parking brake applied 
– Risk of overheating and damage to the 
braking system!
As the exhaust system of your vehicle 
is very hot, even several minutes after 
switching off the engine, never park or run 
the engine on inflammable surfaces (dry 
grass, fallen leaves, etc.) – Risk of fire!

Never leave the engine running in 
an enclosed area without adequate 
ventilation: internal combustion engines 
emit toxic exhaust gases, such as carbon 
monoxide. There is a risk of poisoning and 
death!
In very severe wintry conditions 
(temperatures below -23°C), to guarantee 
correct operation and the longevity of 
the mechanical elements of your vehicle, 
engine and gearbox, the engine must be 
left running for 4 minutes before driving.

Never leave a vehicle unsupervised with 
the engine running. If you have to leave 
your vehicle with the engine running, apply 
the parking brake and put the gearbox into 
neutral or position N or P, depending on 
the type of gearbox.

Driving on flooded roads
We strongly advise against driving on flooded

the gear selector is not in position N, an audible 
signal will sound.

78

DrivingIf you stop the vehicle but keep the engine 
running, you must always move the gear 
selector to the neutral position N.

A continuous audible signal sounds if you 
turn the ignition switch to "OFF" while the 
vehicle is in 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th gear.
If this happens, turn the ignition switch 
to "ON", move the gear selector to the 
position N, return it to position E, M or R, 
then turn the ignition switch to "OFF".

If the vehicle is on a slope, use the brake 
to stop the vehicle from moving and place 
the gear selector to position N, E or R.

In all cases, you must apply the parking 
brake to immobilise the vehicle.

Before doing anything in the engine 
compartment, make sure that the gear 
selector is in neutral N and the parking 
brake is applied.

Operating limits
When on a slope or when hill start assist is 
activated, never keep the vehicle stationary 
using the accelerator: you could damage the 
clutch.
In these situations, an audible signal sounds.
F  In that case, move the gear selector to 

position N.

Gear shift indicator
System which reduces fuel consumption by 
recommending the most appropriate gear.

Operation
Depending on the driving situation and the 
equipment of your vehicle, the system can 
recommend you to change gear.
Gear shift recommendations are for information 
only. In fact, the road layout, the traffic density 
and safety remain the deciding factors when 
choosing the best gear. The driver therefore 
remains responsible for deciding whether or not 
to follow the indications issued by the system.
This function cannot be deactivated.

Example:
-  You are in third gear.
-  You press the accelerator pedal.
-  The system may suggest that you engage 

a higher gear.

If 1 flashes in the instrument panel:

-  engaging reverse gear.

With an ETG gearbox, the system is only 
active in manual mode.

Hill start assist
This system keeps your vehicle briefly 
stationary (for approximately 2 seconds) when 
making a hill start, while you transfer your foot 
from the brake pedal to the accelerator pedal.
This system only operates when:
- 

the vehicle has been brought to a complete 
stop, with your foot on the brake pedal,

-  certain slope conditions are met,
-  with the driver's door closed.

Driving on flooded roads
Before driving in a flooded area, it is 
strongly recommended that you deactivate 
the Stop & Start system.
For more information on Driving advice, 
particularly on flooded roads, refer to the 
corresponding section.

Speed Limit recognition 
and recommendation
This system allows certain road signs detected 
by the camera to be displayed on the touch 
screen (especially the maximum authorised 
speed).

Deactivation/Manual 
reactivation

The Stop & Start system requires a 12 V 
battery of specific technology and 
specification.
All work on this type of battery must be 
carried out only by a PEUGEOT dealer or 
a qualified workshop.
For more information on the 12 V battery, 
refer to the corresponding section.

82

The system is active again; this is confirmed by 
the indicator lamp going off in the instrument 
panel.
The system reactivates automatically every 
time the engine is started by the driver.

Examples of signs recognised:

Specific speed limits, such as those for heavy 
goods vehicles, are not displayed.
The display of the speed limit in the touch 
screen is updated as you pass a speed limit 
sign intended for cars (light vehicles).

DrivingThe units for the speed limits (mph or 
km/h) depend on the country you are 
driving in.
It should be taken into account so that you 
observe the speed limit.
For the system to operate correctly when 
you change country, the units for speed in 
the instrument panel must be those for the 
country you are driving in.

The automatic reading of road signs is 
a driving assistance system and does not 
always display speed limits correctly.
The speed limit signs present on the road 
always take priority over the display by the 
system.
The system cannot in any circumstances 
replace the need for vigilance on the part 
of the driver.
The driver must observe the driving 
regulations and must adapt the speed of 
the vehicle to suit the weather and traffic.
It is possible for the system to not display 
the speed limit if it does not detect a speed 
limit sign within a preset period.
The system is designed to detect signs 
that conform to the Vienna Convention on 
road signs.

Display

To maintain correct operation of the 
system: regularly clean the area in front of 
the camera.
The internal surface of the windscreen can 
also become misted around the camera. 
In humid and cold weather, demist the 
windscreen regularly.

Activation/deactivation

F 

In the touch screen, select 
the "Configuration" menu 
then "General" and activate 
"Configuration of traffic signs 
recognition".

On detection of speed limit information, the 
system displays the value.
If this speed is exceeded, the sign is displayed 
in red and may be accompanied by an audible 
signal (depending on the settings chosen for 
the Speeding alert).

Activation is taken into account after about 
1 second.
Set the associated alerts (no alert, visual 
alerts or visual and sound alerts):
F  In "Speeding alert", set "Notification 

alert" then "Level of notification".

F  In "Overtaking alert", set "Notification 

alert".

When a No Overtaking sign is detected, the 
sign may be displayed fixed or flashing.

Operating limits
The legislation on speed limits is specific to 
each country.
The system does not take account of reduced 
speed limits in the following cases:
-  poor weather (rain, snow),
-  atmospheric pollution,

-  speed limit signs that do not conform to the 

standard, are damaged or distorted.

System which prevents the 
vehicle from exceeding the speed 
programmed by the driver.

The limiter is switched on manually: this 
can be done regardless of the vehicle speed. 
However, if you are travelling at less than 
18 mph (30 km/h), the programmed speed will 
be set at 18 mph (30 km/h).
The speed limiter is paused using the control.
The programmed speed can be exceeded 
temporarily by pressing the accelerator firmly 
beyond the point of resistance.
To return to the programmed speed, simply 
release the accelerator pedal until the set limit 
speed has been reached again.

If an app on your smart phone is used 
via Mirror Screen, the sign displayed by 
the system may be temporarily hidden. It 
will be redisplayed as soon as you pass 
another sign.

The programmed speed is erased when 
the ignition is switched off.

The limiter cannot, under any 
circumstances, replace respect for speed 
limits, nor the vigilance of the driver.

Active City Brake
Active City Brake is a driving assistance 
system that aims to avoid a frontal collision or 
to reduce the speed of an impact if the driver 
does not react or reacts too late (brake applied 
too late).

This system has been designed to improve driving 
safety.
It remains the driver's responsibility to continuously 
monitor the state of the traffic and to assess the 
distances and relative speeds of other vehicles.
Active City Brake cannot in any circumstances 
replace the need for vigilance on the part of the 
driver.

Using a laser sensor and a camera located at 
the top of the windscreen, this system detects 
a vehicle moving in the same direction or 
stationary ahead of your vehicle.
When necessary, the vehicle's braking system 
is operated automatically to reduce the speed 
of impact or to help avoid a collision with the 
vehicle ahead.

Automatic braking occurs later than if 
done by the driver, so as to intervene only 
when there is a high risk of collision.

DrivingConditions of activation
Active City Brake functions if the following 
conditions are met:
•  The engine is running.
•  The vehicle is moving forward.
•  For triggering the pre-collision warning: 

-  the speed is between 9 and 87 mph 

(15 and 140 km/h),

-  the difference in speed between your 

vehicle and the one in front is more than 
about 9 mph (15 km/h).

•  For help in braking:

-  the speed is between about 19 and 

50 mph (30 and 80 km/h),

-  the difference in speed between your 

vehicle and the one in front is more than 
about 19 mph (30 km/h).

•  For automatic pre-collision braking:

-  the speed is between about 6 and 

50 mph (10 and 80 km/h),

-  the difference in speed between your 

vehicle and the one in front is more than 
about 6 mph (10 km/h)

• 

the braking assistance systems (ABS, 
EBFD, EBA) are not faulty.

•  The trajectory control systems (TRC, DSC) 

hare not deactivated or faulty.

•  The vehicle is not making a sharp turn.
•  The system has not triggered in the last ten 

seconds.

Unless the driver de-clutches quickly 
enough during automatic braking, 
triggering of the system may cause the 
engine to stall.

Operation
Three functional stages are possible:
•  Pre-collision warning: if risk of a collision 
with a vehicle is detected, a warning lamp 
comes on, accompanied by an audible 
signal, to warn the driver to take avoiding 
action. The triggering thresholds of the 
warning can be set.

•  Braking assistance: increases the braking 

started by the driver, but only if a risk of 
collision is detected.

•  Automatic pre-collision braking: if 

your vehicle is approaching the vehicle 
in front of you too quickly, the system 
will automatically engage the brakes to 
reduce the speed of impact. The collision 
can be automatically avoided if the speed 
difference between your vehicle and the 
one in front of you is not more than 18 mph 
(30 km/h).

Then you are alerted by the display 
of this warning indicator in the 
instrument panel, accompanied by 
an audible signal.

The brake lamps of your vehicle are lit to warn 
other users.
The automatic braking can lead to the complete 
stop of the vehicle if the situation requires.

87

6DrivingSetting the thresholds for 
triggering the alert

The alert thresholds determine how you want 
to be alerted to the risk of an imminent collision 
with the vehicle travelling in front of you.
You can choose from three thresholds:
A.
"Distant", to be given an early alert 
(cautious driving).
"Normal",
"Close", to be given a later alert (sporty 
driving).

B.
C.

Press this button in succession to 
scroll through the thresholds:
The default setting is "Normal".

Deactivation/reactivation

Press this button for more than 3 seconds.

This warning lamp comes on in the 
instrument panel and the message 
"PCS OFF" is displayed.

88

Press this button again to reactivate the 
system.

This indicator lamp lights up on the 
instrument panel.

The system is reactivated automatically at 
every new start using the key or the "START/
STOP" button.

Operating limits
The system only detects vehicles (cars, 
trucks), stationary or moving in the same 
direction of traffic.

It does not detect small vehicles (bicycles, 
motorcycles), pedestrians or animals, nor 
non-reflective stationary objects.

This system will not trigger or intervene if the 
driver:
-  presses hard on the accelerator (even if the 

speed limiter is active),

-  or suddenly turns the steering wheel 

(avoidance manoeuvre).

The ability to detect is reduced if:
-  you are driving in an environment with sharp 

turns and/or roads in poor condition,

-  carrying an excessively heavy load which 
badly affects the horizontal attitude of your 
vehicle,

-  your vehicle skids.

DrivingWhen weather conditions are difficult 
(extremely heavy rain, snow, fog, hail, 
etc.), braking distances increase, which 
may reduce the system's ability to avoid 
a collision.
The driver must therefore remain 
particularly cautious.

Never let snow build up on the bonnet 
or any object above the bonnet nor at 
the front of the roof: this could enter the 
field of vision of the sensor and obstruct 
detection.

Unwanted triggering
The system may detect a risk of imminent 
collision, particularly in the following conditions:
-  detection of an object close to the edge of 

the road going into a bend (safety rail, street 
light, road sign),

-  detection of a structure at the top or bottom 

of a sharp slope (advertising hoarding, 
public lighting),

-  detection of reflective objects (central 

reservation, etc.) on the road,

-  detection of the top bar of a bridge or 

a signal gantry,

-  passing a vehicle travelling in the other 

direction in a corner,

-  passing a vehicle travelling in the other 

direction, at a crossroads, when your 
vehicle is turning left or right,
if the vehicle in front of you kicks up water or 
snow,
if your vehicle stops very close to an 
overhanging wall or other vehicles,

- 

- 

-  when your vehicle quickly draws close to 

- 
- 

- 
- 

a vehicle in front,
if the vehicle is raised or lowered,
if the vehicle is passing through a plastic 
curtain,
if you are driving in fog or smoke,
if the sensor is misaligned (replacement 
after a collision).

Operating faults
Sensor fault
Operation of the laser sensor may be 
disrupted by accumulation of dirt, formation 
of condensation on the windscreen or 
the presence of a component causing an 
obstruction (e.g. an open bonnet).

If this happens, you are alerted by 
the flashing of this warning lamp in 
the instrument panel.

Use windscreen demisting and regularly clean 
the area of the windscreen in front of the 
sensor.

Do not stick or otherwise attach any object 
on the windscreen in front of the sensor.

System fault

If there is a system fault, you are 
alerted by the flashing of this 
warning lamp in the instrument 
panel.

Have the system checked by a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

In the event of an impact to the 
windscreen at the sensor, deactivate the 
system and contact a PEUGEOT dealer 
or a qualified workshop to have your 
windscreen replaced.

Do not attempt to remove, adjust or test 
the sensor.
Only a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop is able to work on the system.

89

6DrivingLane departure warning 
system
System that detects involuntary crossing of 
longitudinal markings of roads, using a camera 
that recognises the continuous or broken lines.
To increase your safety, the camera analyses 
the image then triggers a warning if the driver's 
attention drops and the vehicle drifts over 
a lane marking (speed greater than 30 mph 
(50 km/h)).
This system is particularly suited to motorways 
and dual carriageways.

The lane departure warning system 
cannot under any circumstances replace 
the need for vigilance on the part of the 
driver.
You must observe the driving regulations 
and take a break every two hours.

When driving with snow chains or with the 
spare wheel fitted, you must deactivate 
the system.

DrivingOperating fault

If there is a fault, this warning lamp 
(orange) comes on in the instrument 
panel.

Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop without delay.

Detection may be disrupted:
- 
- 

If the road markings are worn.
If there is little contrast between the 
road markings and the road surface,
If the windscreen is dirty.
In certain extreme weather conditions: 
fog, heavy rain, snow, bright sunlight 
or direct exposure to the sun (low sun, 
leaving a tunnel, etc.), and shadows.

Reversing camera
The reversing camera is activated automatically 
when reverse gear is engaged.

It is normal to have a part of the number plate 
showing in the bottom of the screen.

The reversing camera cannot, in any circumstances, 
replace the need for vigilance on the part of the driver.

Never reverse while looking only at the 
screen.

High-pressure jet wash
When washing your vehicle, do not direct 
the lance at the lens of the camera from 
a distance of less than 30 cm.

The field covered by the camera is limited: 
objects very close to the bumper or below it are 
not visible.
The wide angle lens of the camera distorts 
the image on the screen: the distances seen 
on the screen may be different from the real 
distances. This distortion varies depending on 
the load conditions of the vehicle and slope of 
the road.

Clean the reversing camera regularly 
using a soft, dry cloth.

The visual feedback is only shown on the 
touch screen, with an indication of the edge of 
the rear bumper (red line 1) and the general 
direction of the vehicle (blue lines 2).

6DrivingUnder-inflation detection

This system automatically monitors the tyre 
pressure while driving.
The system monitors the pressure in all four 
tyres, once the vehicle is moving.
It compares the information given by the 
wheel speed sensors with reference values, 
which must be reinitialised after every tyre 
pressure adjustment or wheel change.
The system triggers an alert as soon as it 
detects a drop in the pressure of one or more 
tyres.

The tyre under-inflation detection system 
does not replace the need for vigilance on 
the part of the driver.
This system still requires you to check the 
tyre inflation pressure (including the spare 
wheel) every month as well as before 
a long journey.
Driving with under-inflated tyres impairs 
handling, extends braking distances and 
causes early tyre wear, particularly in 
adverse conditions (heavy loads, high 
speeds, long journeys).

The tyre pressure specifications for your 
vehicle can be found on the tyre pressure 
label.
For more information on the 
Identification markings, refer to the 
corresponding section.
Tyre pressures should be checked when 
the tyres are "cold" (vehicle stopped for 
1 hour or after a journey of less than 
6 miles (10 km) at moderate speeds).
Otherwise (when hot), add 0.3 bar to the 
pressures shown on the label.

Driving with under-inflated tyres 
increases fuel consumption.

Under-inflation alert

This is shown by the warning lamp 
coming on, fixed, accompanied by 
an audible signal.

F  Reduce speed immediately, avoid excessive 

steering movements and sudden braking.

F  Stop as soon as it is safe to do so.

Detection of loss of pressure does not 
always bring about a visible deformation 
of the tyre. Do not make do with just 
a visual check.

92

DrivingF  If you have a compressor (for example the 

one provided in the temporary puncture 
repair kit), check the pressure of all four 
tyres. If it is not possible to do this check 
immediately, drive carefully at reduced 
speed.

or
F  In the event of a puncture, use the 

temporary puncture repair kit or the spare 
wheel (depending on equipment).

The alert is kept active until the system is 
reinitialised.

Reinitialisation

The system must be reinitialised after any 
adjustment to the pressures of one or more 
tyres, and after changing one or more wheels.
A label on the driver's side centre pillar reminds 
you of this.

Before reinitialising the system, ensure 
that the pressures of the four tyres 
are correct for the conditions of use 
of the vehicle and conform to the 
recommendations on the tyre pressure 
label.
The under-inflation alert can only be relied 
on if the reinitialisation of the system has 
been done with the pressures in the four 
tyres correctly adjusted.
The under-inflation detection system 
does not give a warning if a pressure is 
incorrect at the time of reinitialisation.

The system must be reset with the ignition on 
(switch in the "ON" position or "ON" mode) and 
the vehicle stationary.
F  Open the glove box.
F  Press the reinitialisation button.

F  When the indicator flashes 

3 times in the instrument panel, 
the reinitialisation is complete.

F  Wait a few minutes before switching off 
the ignition (switch to "ACC" or "LOCK" 
position, or "OFF" mode).

The new pressure parameters saved are 
treated as reference values by the system.

Snow chains
The system does not have to be 
reinitialised after fitting or removing snow 
chains.

The under-inflation alert can only be relied 
on if the reinitialisation of the system has 
been done with the pressures in the four 
tyres correctly adjusted.

93

6DrivingOperating fault

The flashing and then fixed 
illumination of the under-inflation 
warning lamp indicates a fault with 
the system.

In this case, under-inflation monitoring of the 
tyres is no longer assured.
Have the system checked by a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

After any work has been done on 
the system, the pressures of the four 
tyres must be checked and the system 
reinitialised.

DrivingPEUGEOT & TOTAL
A PARTNERSHIP FOR PERFORMANCE!
The PEUGEOT TOTAL team knows how to push back the 
limits of performance to win victories in the most difficult 
conditions, as confirmed by the first three places achieved in 
2017.
To obtain these exceptional results, the PEUGEOT Sport 
teams chose TOTAL QUARTZ for the PEUGEOT 3008 DKR, a 
high-tech lubricant that protects the engine in the most severe 
conditions.

TOTAL QUARTZ protects your engine against the 
effects of time.
TOTAL QUARTZ Ineo First is a high performance lubricant, 
the result of work done together by PEUGEOT and TOTAL 
R&D. Specially formulated for the engines in PEUGEOT 
vehicles, its innovative technology significantly reduces 
CO2 emissions and keeps your engine clean.

Fuel tank
The capacity of the tank is about 35 litres.
Low fuel level

Opening the filler cap may create a noise 
caused by an inrush of air. This is entirely 
normal and results from the sealing of the fuel 
system.

When the fuel in the tank reaches 
a low level, this warning lamp 
comes on in the instrument panel, 
accompanied by an audible warning.
The message "LO FUEL" is displayed instead 
of the range.
You have about 5 litres of fuel left.
In certain driving conditions and depending on 
the engine in your vehicle, your range may be 
less than 30 miles (50 km).

If you run out of fuel, the emission 
control warning lamp may come on 
in the instrument panel. It will go out 
automatically after several engine starts.

Refuelling
Refuelling must be done with the engine and 
ignition off (ignition switch to "LOCK" or 
"OFF").
A label inside the fuel flap reminds you of the 
type of fuel to use.
Additions of fuel must be of at least 5 litres, in 
order to be registered by the fuel gauge.

96

To refuel in complete safety:
F  You must stop the engine and turn off 

the ignition (switch to LOCK or OFF 
mode).

F  Pull the control on the lower part of the 

dashboard, driver's side, to unlock the fuel 
filler flap.

F  Open the fuel filler flap.

F  Unscrew the cap and place it on its support 

(on the flap).

F  Introduce the filler nozzle and push it in as 
far as possible before starting to refuel (risk 
of blowback).

F  Keep it in this position during the whole 

filling operation.

Once you have finished refuelling:
F  Screw the cap back on again until you hear 

a click. When you release the cap, it will 
turn slightly in the opposite direction.

F  Push the fuel flap to close it.

When filling the tank, do not continue 
beyond the 3rd cut off of the nozzle; this 
could cause malfunctions.
Your vehicle is fitted with a catalytic converter, 
which helps to reduce the level of harmful 
emissions in the exhaust gases.
The filler neck is narrower, allowing only 
unleaded petrol nozzles to be introduced.

Practical informationCompatibility of fuels

Snow chains

      

Fuel used for petrol engines
The petrol engines are compatible with biofuels 
that conform to current and future European 
standards and which can be obtained from 
filling stations:

Petrol that meets standard EN228, 
mixed with a biofuel that meets 
standard EN15376.

The only petrol additives authorised 
for use are those that meet the 
B715001 standard.

Travelling abroad
Certain fuels could damage the engine of 
your vehicle.
In certain countries, the use of a particular 
fuel may be required (specific octane 
rating, specific trade name, etc.) to ensure 
correct operation of the engine.
For any additional information, contact a dealer.

In wintry conditions, snow chains 
improve traction as well as the 
behaviour of the vehicle when 
braking.

Snow chains must be fitted only to the 
front wheels. They must never be fitted to 
"space-saver" type spare wheels.

It is strongly recommended that before 
you leave, you practise fitting the snow 
chains on a level and dry surface.

Avoid driving with snow chains on roads 
that have been cleared of snow to avoid 
damaging your vehicle's tyres and the 
road surface. If your vehicle is fitted with 
alloy wheels, check that no part of the 
chain or its fixings is in contact with the 
wheel rim.

Take account of the legislation in force in 
your country on the use of snow chains 
and the maximum authorised speed.

Only use the chains designed to be fitted to the 
type of wheels fitted to your vehicle:

Installation tips
F  If you have to fit the chains during a journey, 
stop the vehicle on a flat surface on the side 
of the road.

F  Apply the parking brake and position any 
wheel chocks under the wheels to prevent 
movement of your vehicle.

F  Fit the chains following the instructions 

provided by the manufacturer.

F  Move off gently and drive for a few 

moments, without exceeding 31 mph 
(50 km/h).

F  Stop your vehicle and check that the snow 

chains are correctly tightened.

7Practical informationEnergy economy mode
(Only for vehicles equipped with the Keyless 
Entry and Starting system.)
System which manages the duration of use of 
certain functions to conserve a sufficient level 
of charge in the battery.
After the engine has stopped, you can still 
use functions such as the audio system, 
windscreen wipers, dipped beam headlamps, 
courtesy lamps, etc. for a max. combined time 
of 20 minutes.
This period may be greatly reduced if the 
battery is not fully charged.

Entry into the mode
Once this time has elapsed, the active 
functions are put on standby.

Exiting the mode
These functions will be automatically restored 
the next time the vehicle is used.
To restore the use of these functions 
immediately, start the engine and allow it run 
for at least 5 minutes.

98

Let the engine run for the duration 
specified to ensure that the battery charge 
is sufficient.
Do not repeatedly and continuously restart 
the engine in order to charge the battery.
A flat battery prevents the engine from 
starting.
For more information on the 12 V battery, 
refer to the corresponding section.

Maximum authorised weight on the roof

Checking levels
Check all of these levels regularly, in line with 
the manufacturer's service schedule. Top them 
up if necessary, unless otherwise indicated.
If a level drops significantly, have the 
corresponding system checked by a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

The liquid must comply with the 
manufacturer's recommendations and with 
the vehicle's engine.

99

7Practical informationTo ensure that the reading is correct, your 
vehicle must be parked on a level surface 
with the engine stopped for more than 
30 minutes.

It is normal to top up the oil level between 
two services (or oil changes). PEUGEOT 
recommends that you check the level, and top 
up, if necessary, every 3,000 miles (5,000 km).

Checking using the dipstick
The location of the dipstick is shown in the 
corresponding underbonnet layout view.
F  Take the dipstick by its coloured grip and 

pull it out completely.

F  Wipe the end of the dipstick using a clean 

non-fluffy cloth.

F  Refit the dipstick and push fully down, then 

pull it out again to make the visual check: 
the correct level is between marks A and B.

Take care when working under the bonnet, 
as certain areas of the engine may be 
extremely hot (risk of burns) and the 
cooling fan could start at any time (even 
with the ignition off).

Used products

Avoid prolonged contact of used oil or 
fluids with the skin.
Most of these fluids are harmful to health 
or indeed very corrosive.

Do not discard used oil or fluids into 
sewers or onto the ground.
Take used oil to a PEUGEOT dealer 
or a qualified workshop and dispose 
of in the containers reserved for this 
purpose.

Engine oil level

The check is carried out either 
using the oil level indicator on the 
instrument panel when the ignition is 
switched on, for vehicles equipped 
with an electric gauge, or using the 
dipstick.

100

A = MAX
B = MIN

If you find that the level is above the A mark or 
below the B mark, do not start the engine.
- 

If the level is above the MAX mark (risk of 
damage to the engine), contact a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.
If the level is below the MIN mark, you must 
top up the engine oil.

- 

Oil grade
Before topping up the oil or changing the oil, 
check that the oil is the correct grade for your 
engine and conforms to the manufacturer's 
recommendations.

Practical informationTopping up the engine oil level
The location of the oil filler cap is shown in the 
corresponding underbonnet layout view.
F  Unscrew the oil filler cap to access the filler 

opening.

F  Add oil in small quantities, avoiding any 
spills on engine components (risk of fire).
F  Wait a few minutes before checking the 

level again using the dipstick.

F  Add more oil if necessary.
F  After checking the level, carefully refit the oil 

filler cap and the dipstick in its tube.

Engine oil change
In order to maintain the reliability of the engine 
and emissions control system, never use 
additives in the engine oil.

Brake fluid level

Access to the tank

F  Unclip the plastic cover, located at the 

bottom of the windscreen, by pressing on 
both tabs.

When you unclip the plastic cover, make 
sure not to remove the seal.

Fluid specification
This fluid must conform to the manufacturer's 
recommendations.

The fluid level should be close to the 
"MAX" mark. If it is not, check the 
brake pad wear.

Coolant level

The level of this fluid must be 
between the marks "FULL" or "F" 
and "LOW" or "L".

The check and top up must only be done with 
the engine cold.
A low coolant level presents a risk of serious 
damage to your engine.
When the engine is hot, the temperature of the 
coolant is regulated by the fan.
In addition, as the cooling system is 
pressurised, wait at least one hour after 
switching off the engine before carrying out any 
work.
To avoid any risk of scalding, unscrew the cap 
two turns to release the pressure. After it has 
dropped, remove the cap and top up.

The cooling fan may start after 
switching off the engine: take care 
with articles and clothing that might be 
caught by the fan blades.

Fluid specifications
These fluids must conform to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.

Screenwash fluid level

Top up to the required level when 
necessary.

101

7Practical informationFluid specification
The screenwash fluid must be topped up with 
a ready for use mix.
In winter (temperatures below zero), a fluid with 
antifreeze must be used that is appropriate for 
the prevailing conditions, in order to preserve 
the elements of the system (pump, tank, ducts, 
etc.).
Filling with pure water is prohibited under all 
circumstances (risk of freezing, limestone 
deposits, etc.).

Checks
Unless otherwise indicated, check these 
components in accordance with the 
manufacturer's service schedule.
Otherwise, have them checked by a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

12 V battery

The battery does not require any 
maintenance.
However, check regularly that the 
terminals are correctly tightened 
(versions without quick release terminals) 
and that the connections are clean.

For more information on the precautions 
to take before starting work on the 12 V 
battery, refer to the corresponding 
section.

102

A clogged passenger compartment 
filter may have an adverse effect on 
the performance of the air conditioning 
system and generate undesirable odours.

Oil filter

Change the oil filter each time the 
engine oil is changed.

Manual gearbox

The gearbox does not require any 
maintenance (no oil change).

Clutch
The clutch is mechanically operated and 
requires regular adjustment.

If there is a malfunction (for example, 
difficulty in pulling away), contact 
a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

Versions equipped with Stop & Start are 
fitted with a 12 V lead-acid battery of 
specific technology and specification.
Its replacement should be carried out 
only by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

Air filter

Depending on the environment 
(e.g. dusty atmosphere) and the 
use of the vehicle (e.g. city driving), 
replace it twice as often if 
necessary.

Passenger compartment 
filter

Depending on the environment 
(e.g. dusty atmosphere) and the 
use of the vehicle (e.g. city driving), 
replace it twice as often if 
necessary.

Practical informationETG gearbox

Parking brake

The ETG gearbox does not require 
any maintenance (no oil change).

Brake pads

Brake wear depends on the style 
of driving, particularly in the case 
of vehicles used in town, over short 
distances. It may be necessary to 
have the condition of the brakes 
checked, even between vehicle 
services.

Unless there is a leak in the circuit, a drop in 
the brake fluid level indicates that the brake 
pads are worn.

Brake disc/drum wear
For information on checking 
brake disc/drum wear, contact 
a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

If excessive travel or a loss of 
effectiveness of this system is 
noticed, the parking brake must 
be checked, even between two 
services.

This system must be checked by a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

Wheels and tyres

The pressure must be checked on 
all tyres, including the spare wheel, 
when the tyres are "cold", at least 
once a month and before a long 
journey.

The pressures given on the tyre pressure label 
are valid for "cold" tyres. If you have driven for 
more than 10 minutes or more than 6 miles 
(10 kilometres) at more than 31 mph (50 km/h), 
0.3 bar (30 kPa) should be added to the values 
given on the label.
Under-inflation increases fuel consumption. 
Non-compliant tyre pressure causes premature 
wear on tyres and has an adverse effect on the 
vehicle's road holding – Risk of an accident!

Driving with worn or damaged tyres reduces 
braking efficiency and control of the vehicle's 
steering. Regular inspections of the condition 
of tyres (tread and sides) and rims are 
recommended as well as making sure that 
valves are fitted.
Using different size wheels and tyres from 
those specified can affect the lifetime of tyres, 
wheel rotation, ground clearance and the 
speedometer reading and have an adverse 
effect on road holding.
Fitting different tyres on the front and rear axles 
can cause the ESC to mistime.

Only use products recommended by 
PEUGEOT or products of equivalent 
quality and specification.
In order to optimise the operation of 
components as important as those in the 
braking system, PEUGEOT selects and 
offers very specific products.
After washing the vehicle, dampness, or 
in wintry conditions, ice can form on the 
brake discs and pads: braking efficiency 
may be reduced. Make light brake 
applications to dry and defrost the brakes.

12 V battery
Procedure for starting the engine using another 
battery or charging a discharged battery.

General points
Lead-acid starter batteries

Batteries contain harmful substances 
such as sulphuric acid and lead.
They must be disposed of in 
accordance with regulations and must 
not, in any circumstances, be discarded 
with household waste.
Take used remote control batteries and 
vehicle batteries to a special collection 
point.

Protect your eyes and face before 
handling the battery.
All operations on the battery must be 
carried out in a well ventilated area and 
away from naked flames and sources of 
sparks, so as to avoid the risk of explosion 
or fire.
Wash your hands afterwards.

121

8In the event of a breakdownThe presence of this label, in particular 
with the Stop & Start system, indicates 
the use of a 12 V lead-acid battery with 
special technology and specification; the 
involvement of a PEUGEOT dealer or 
a qualified workshop is essential when 
replacing or disconnecting the battery.

After refitting the battery, the Stop & 
Start system will only be active after 
a continuous period of immobilisation of 
the vehicle, a period which depends on the 
climatic conditions and the state of charge 
of the battery (up to about 8 hours).

Before doing any work
Immobilise the vehicle: apply the parking 
brake, put the gearbox in neutral, then 
switch off the ignition.
Check that all electrical equipment is 
switched off.

Access to the battery

The battery is located under the bonnet.
For access to the (+) terminal:
F  unlock the bonnet by activating the internal 
release lever, then the external safety catch.

F  raise the bonnet and secure it with its stay,
F  lift the plastic cover for access to the (+) 

terminal.

Do not push the vehicle to start the engine 
if your vehicle has an ETG gearbox.

Starting using another 
battery
When your vehicle's battery is discharged, the 
engine can be started using a slave battery 
(external or on another vehicle) and jump lead 
cables or a battery booster.

122

Never try to start the engine by connecting 
a battery charger.
Never use a 24 V or higher battery 
booster.
Check beforehand that the slave battery 
has a nominal voltage of 12 V and 
a minimum capacity equal to that of the 
discharged battery.
The two vehicles must not be in contact 
with each other.
Switch off all the electrical consumers 
on both vehicles (audio system, wipers, 
lighting, etc.).
Make sure that the jump leads are not 
close to moving parts of the engine (fan, 
belts, etc.).
Do not disconnect the (+) terminal while 
the engine is running.

F  Lift the plastic cover on the (+) terminal, if 

your vehicle has one.

In the event of a breakdownF  Connect the red cable to the positive 

terminal (+) of the flat battery A (at the metal 
elbow) then to the positive terminal (+) of the 
slave battery B or the booster.

F  Connect one end of the green or black 

cable to the negative terminal (-) of backup 
battery B or the booster (or an earth point 
on the other vehicle).

F  Connect the other end of the green or black 

cable to earth point C on the broken down 
vehicle.

F  Start the engine of the vehicle with the 

good battery and leave it running for a few 
minutes.

F  Operate the starter on the broken down 

vehicle and let the engine run.

If the engine does not start straight away, 
switch off the ignition and wait a few moments 
before trying again.

F  Wait for it to return to idle.
F  Disconnect the jump lead cables in reverse 

order.

F  Refit the plastic cover to the (+) terminal, if 

your vehicle has one.

F  Allow the engine to run for at least 

30 minutes, by driving or with the vehicle 
stationary, so that the battery reaches an 
adequate state of charge.

Before disconnecting the battery
Wait 2 minutes after switching off the ignition 
before disconnecting the battery.
Close the windows, the electric fabric roof and 
the doors before disconnecting the battery.

After reconnecting the battery
After each time that the battery has been 
reconnected, switch on the ignition and wait 
1 minute before starting the engine, to allow 
the electronic systems to initialise. However, 
if minor problems persist after this procedure, 
contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

Some functions, including Stop & Start, 
are not available if the battery is not 
sufficiently charged.

Charging the battery using 
a battery charger
F  Disconnect the battery from the vehicle.
F  Follow the instructions of use provided by 

the manufacturer of the charger.

F  Reconnect the battery starting with the 

positive terminal (+).

F  Check that the terminals and connectors 

are clean. If they are covered with sulphate 
(whitish or greenish deposit), remove and 
clean them.

Never try to charge a frozen battery – risk 
of explosion!
If the battery has frozen, have it checked 
by a PEUGEOT dealer or by a qualified 
workshop who will check that the internal 
components have not been damaged and 
that the container has not cracked, which 
would mean a risk of toxic and corrosive 
acid leaking.

Towing the vehicle

Your vehicle can only be towed from the 
front.

F  Take the detachable towing ring kept in the 

toolbox under the boot mat.

F  Unclip the plastic cover by pressing on the 

lower part.

F  Screw the towing eye in fully.
F  Install the towing arm.
F  With a manual gearbox: move the gear lever 

to neutral.

123

8In the event of a breakdownF  With an ETG gearbox: move the selector to 

position N.

Failure to follow this instruction may cause 
damage to some components (braking, 
transmission, etc.) and the absence of 
braking assistance when the engine is 
restarted.

F  Unlock the steering and release the parking 

brake.

F  Switch on the hazard warning lamps on 

both vehicles.

Never use the radiator crossmember.

When towing, the speed limiter must be 
deactivated, as well as the "Active City 
Brake" system if so equipped.

General recommendations

Press "Update" to update the list.

The external environment (hills, buildings, 
tunnels, car parks, basements, etc.) may 
block reception, including in RDS tracking 
mode, frequency search.
This behaviour is normal in the 
propagation of radio waves and does not 
indicate any failure of the car radio.

Presetting a station

Press "MODE" to select the FM or 
AM waveband.

When the alternative frequency (AF) 
function is activated, the system selects 
the best frequency RDS (region code) of 
the station being listened to.
However, in certain conditions, following 
this station is not guaranteed over the 
whole country, because radio stations do 
not cover 100% of the territory. During 
weak reception, the tuning moves to the 
frequency of a regional station.

.RadioListen to TA messages

The TA (Traffic Announcement) function 
gives priority to TA alert messages. 
To be active, this function requires 
good reception of a radio station that 
broadcasts this type of message. As soon 
as traffic information is broadcast, the 
media playing is interrupted automatically 
to issue the TA message. Normal play of 
the media is restored after the message 
has been issued.

DAB (Digital Audio 
Broadcasting) radio
Digital radio

Digital radio offers a superior listening 
experience and also additional categories 
of information announcements (TA INFO).
The various "multiplex/set" (set of 
analogue messages and digital data 
streams combined into one signal) 
provide a choice of radio stations sorted 
alphabetically.

Press "MENU" to display the list.

Turn the dial to select 'Radio', press 
to confirm.

Turn the dial to select "FM AF", 
press to activate or deactivate 
reception of traffic announcements.

current station.

Press a button for an extended 
time to store the current station 
being listened to. The station name 
is displayed and an audible signal 
confirms storage.

DAB/FM auto tracking

Digital radio does not cover 100% of the 
country.
When the quality of the digital signal is 
poor, the Alternative DAB Frequency " DAB 
AF" option allows you to continue listening 
to the same station by automatically 
switching to the corresponding "FM" 
analogue radio station (if it exists).

Press MENU to display the list.

Turn the dial to select 'Radio', press 
to confirm.

Turn the dial to select "DAB AF", 
press to enable or disable the 
frequency.

8

RadioIf "DAB AF" tracking is enabled, there 
is a lag of a few seconds while the 
system switches to "FM" analogue radio, 
sometimes with a change in volume.
Once the digital signal quality becomes 
good again, the system automatically 
changes back to "DAB".

If the "DAB" station being listened to is 
not available, or if the "DAB AF" is not 
enabled, the sound is muted when the 
quality of the digital signal becomes too 
poor.

The system builds playlists (in temporary 
memory), an operation which can take 
from a few seconds to several minutes at 
the first connection.
Reduce the number of non-music files 
and the number of folders to reduce the 
waiting time.
The playlists are updated every time the 
ignition is switched off or a USB stick is 
connected. However, the audio system 
saves these lists and loading time will be 
reduced if they have not been changed.

RESPONSE

invisible.

SOLUTION
-  Check that your Bluetooth telephone is 

enabled.

-  Check in the telephone settings that it is 

"visible to all".

CarPlay® and Android Auto do not work.

CarPlay® and Android Auto may not activate if 
the USB cables are of poor quality.

Use authentic USB cables to ensure 
compatibility.

The Bluetooth telephone is not compatible with 
the system

You can check the compatibility of your 
telephone at www.peugeot.co.uk (services).

No sound can be heard from the connected 
Bluetooth telephone.

The sound depends on both the system and 
the telephone.

Increase the volume of the audio system, 
possibly to the maximum, and increase the 
sound from the telephone if required.

Ambient noise affects the quality of the 
telephone call.

Reduce ambient noise (close windows, reduce 
ventilation, slow down, etc.).

The contacts are not listed in alphabetical 
order.

Some telephones offer display options. 
Depending on the settings chosen, contacts 
can be transferred in a specific order.

Modify the telephone directory display settings.

The system does not receive SMS.

The Bluetooth mode of your telephone does 
not allow transmission of SMS text messages 
to the system.

.RadioUSB, portable device

QUESTION
The waiting time after inserting a USB stick is 
long.

RESPONSE
Upon insertion of a new key, the system reads 
a certain amount of data (directory, title, artist, 
etc.). This may take from a few seconds to 
a few minutes.

SOLUTION
Limit the number of sub-folders in the file 
structure on the memory stick.

Some information characters in the currently 
playing media are not displayed correctly.

The audio system cannot process certain 
character types.

Use standard characters to name tracks and 
directories.

Playback of streaming files does not start.

The connected device does not automatically 
launch playback.

Start playback from the device.

Names of tracks and playing time are not 
displayed on the audio streaming screen.

The Bluetooth profile does not allow the 
transfer of this information.

Radio

QUESTION
The reception quality of the tuned radio station 
gradually deteriorates or the station presets are 
not working (no sound, 87.5 MHz is displayed, 
etc.).

16

RESPONSE
The vehicle is too far from the transmitter of 
the station being listened to or there is no 
transmitter present in the geographical area.

SOLUTION
Activate the "RDS" function to have the system 
check whether a more powerful transmitter is 
within the geographic area.

The surroundings (hill, building, tunnel, 
underground parking, etc.) are blocking 
reception, including in RDS tracking mode.

The antenna is missing or has been 
damaged (for example in a car wash or in an 
underground car park).

This behaviour is normal and does not indicate 
failure of the audio system.

Have the antenna checked by a PEUGEOT 
dealer.

RadioI cannot find some radio stations in the list of 
stations received.

The station is no longer being received or its 
name has changed in the list.

The name of the radio station changes.

Instead of their names, some radio stations 
transmit other information (song title, for 
example).
The system interprets this data as the name of 
the station.

Settings, configuration

QUESTION
There is a difference in sound quality between 
the various audio sources (radio, USB, etc.).

With the engine off, the system cuts off after 
several minutes of use.

RESPONSE
To enable optimum listening quality, the audio 
settings (Volume, Treble, Medium, Bass) 
can be adapted to different sound sources, 
which may generate audible differences when 
changing source (radio, USB, etc.).

SOLUTION
Check that the audio settings are suited to the 
sources being listened to. It is recommended 
to set automatic adjustment of sound (Low, 
Medium, High) in the audio configurations.
Check the quality and format of your recording.

When the engine is switched off, the time for 
which the system will operate depends on the 
state of charge of the battery.
The cut off is normal: the system switches to 
energy economy mode and cuts off to prevent 
the vehicle's battery becoming discharged.

Start the vehicle's engine to increase the state 
of charge of the battery.

SOLUTION
Limit the number of sub-folders in the file 
structure on the memory stick.

Some information characters in the currently 
playing media are not displayed correctly.

The audio system cannot process certain 
character types.

Use standard characters to name tracks and 
directories.

Playback of streaming files does not start.

The connected device does not automatically 
launch playback.

Start playback from the device.

Names of tracks and playing time are not 
displayed on the audio streaming screen.

The Bluetooth profile does not allow the 
transfer of this information.

.7-inch touch screen tabletRadio

QUESTION
The reception quality of the tuned radio station 
gradually deteriorates or the station presets are 
not working (no sound, 87.5 MHz is displayed, 
etc.).

RESPONSE
The vehicle is too far from the transmitter of 
the station being listened to or there is no 
transmitter present in the geographical area.

SOLUTION
Activate the "RDS" function to have the system 
check whether a more powerful transmitter is 
within the geographic area.

The surroundings (hill, building, tunnel, 
underground parking, etc.) are blocking 
reception, including in RDS tracking mode.

The aerial is missing or has been damaged (for 
example in a car wash or in an underground 
car park).

This behaviour is normal and does not indicate 
failure of the audio system.

Have the aerial checked by a PEUGEOT 
dealer.

I cannot find some radio stations in the list of 
stations received.

The station is no longer being received or its 
name has changed in the list.

The name of the radio station changes.

Instead of their names, some radio stations 
transmit other information (song title, for 
example).
The system interprets this data as the name of 
the station.

7-inch touch screen tabletSettings, configuration

QUESTION
There is a difference in sound quality between 
the various audio sources (radio, USB, etc.).

With the engine off, the system switches off 
after several minutes of use.

RESPONSE
To enable optimum listening quality, the audio 
settings (Volume, Treble, Medium, Bass) 
can be adapted to different sound sources, 
which may generate audible differences when 
changing source (radio, USB, etc.).

SOLUTION
Check that the audio settings are suited to the 
sources being listened to. It is recommended 
to set automatic adjustment of sound (Low, 
Medium, High) in the audio configurations.
Check the quality and format of your recording.

When the engine is switched off, the time for 
which the system will operate depends on the 
state of charge of the battery.
The switch-off is normal: the system switches to 
energy economy mode and switches off to prevent 
the vehicle's battery becoming discharged.

Start the vehicle's engine to increase the state 
of charge of the battery.
