front passenger seat must be
deactivated; if not, the triggering of
the airbags poses a risk of fatal
injury to the child.
This is especially the case if rear-
facing child restraint systems are
used on the front passenger seat.

Airbag deactivation 3 52.
Airbag label 3 47.
Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This makes sure that the
child's backbone, which is still very
weak, is under less strain in the event
of an accident.
Suitable are restraint systems that
comply with valid UN ECE
regulations. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct.
Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving without
any notification. The filter is cleaned
by periodically burning off the soot
particles at high temperature. This
process takes place automatically
under set driving conditions and may
take up to 25 minutes. Typically it

117

Driving and operating
needs 15 minutes. Autostop is not
available and fuel consumption may
be higher during this period. The
emission of smells and smoke during
this process is normal.
Under certain driving conditions, e.g.
short distances, the system cannot
clean itself automatically.

If the cleaning of the filter is required
and if previous driving conditions did
not enable automatic cleaning, it will
be indicated by control indicator %.
Depending on version, a warning
message may also appear in the
Driver Information Centre 3 89.

Note
The volume of the warning chime
can also be adjusted via the Driver
Information Centre 3 89.
Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing your journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
Control indicator R 3 83.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.

123
Driving and operating
ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting off the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.
Fault
In the event of a fault, control indicator
u illuminates in the instrument
cluster. Depending on version, a

Ride control systems
Traction Control system
The Anti-Slip Regulator (ASR) is a
component of the Electronic Stability
Control (ESC).
ASR improves driving stability when
necessary, regardless of the type of
road surface or tyre grip, by
preventing the drive wheels from
spinning.
As soon as the drive wheels starts to
spin, engine output is reduced and
the wheel spinning the most is braked
individually. This considerably
improves the driving stability of the
vehicle on slippery road surfaces.

The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.

135

Driving and operating
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12%.
The permitted trailer load applies up
to the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10%
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8%, e.g. motorways).
The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 175.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.

Driving and operating

136
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (60 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.
Rear axle load
The permissible axle loads (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) must not be exceeded.

Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
Tyres of size 185/65 R15,
195/65 R15 and 195/60 R16 C are
permitted as winter tyres.
In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the speed sticker in

Directional tyres
Directional tyres must be mounted so
that they rotate in the correct
direction. The proper rotation
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel. This also applies to vehicles
with tyre pressure monitoring system.
Unscrew the valve cap.
Tyre pressure 3 185.
The tyre pressure information label
on the door frame (if fitted) indicates
the original equipment tyres and the
correspondent tyre pressures.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.

Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.
Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options. For the correct tyre
pressure value, follow the procedure
below:
1. Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 178.

2. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 185.
For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressures.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

9 Warning

For specific tyres the
recommended tyre pressure as
shown in the tyre pressure table
may exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.
Never exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.

If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased on a vehicle with tyre
pressure monitoring system, switch
off ignition.
Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase. Tyre pressure
values provided on the tyre
information label and tyre pressure
chart are valid for cold tyres, which
means at 20 °C.
The pressure increases by nearly
10 kPa (0.1 bar) for a 10 °C
temperature increase. This must be
considered when warm tyres are
checked.

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The Tyre Pressure Monitoring
System (TPMS) uses radio and
sensor technology to check tyre
pressure levels.

Caution

Tyre pressure monitoring system
warns only about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

The TPMS sensors monitor the air
pressure in the tyres and transmit tyre
pressure readings to a receiver
located in the vehicle.
All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.
Tyre pressure chart 3 185.

Note
In countries where the tyre pressure
monitoring system is legally
required, the use of wheels without
pressure sensors will invalidate the
vehicle type approval.
Low tyre pressure condition

A detected low tyre pressure
condition is indicated by illumination
of control indicator w 3 86 together
with a warning chime. In vehicles with
Multifunction version of the Driver
Information Centre, a corresponding
message is also displayed.

Vehicle care

157

If w illuminates, stop as soon as
possible and inflate the tyres as
recommended 3 185.
After inflating, driving may be
required to update the tyre pressure
values in the system. During this time
w may illuminate.
If w illuminates at lower temperatures
and extinguishes after some driving,
this could be an indicator for
approaching a low tyre pressure
condition. Check tyre pressure of all
four tyres.
If the tyre pressure must be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition.
Only mount wheels with pressure
sensors, otherwise the tyre pressure
value cannot be recognised by the
system and w flashes for several
seconds then illuminates
continuously. In vehicles with
Multifunction version of the Driver
Information Centre, a corresponding
message is also displayed.

Vehicle care

158
A spare wheel or temporary spare
wheel is not equipped with pressure
sensors. TPMS is not operational for
these wheels. For the further three
wheels, TPMS remains operational.
Spare wheel 3 163, Wheel changing
3 162.
Control indicator w and (depending
on version) a corresponding message
appears at each ignition cycle until
the tyres are inflated to the correct
tyre pressure.
Driver Information Centre 3 89.
Relearn function
After changing wheels, TPMS needs
to recalculate. The relearn process
takes up to 20 minutes of driving with
a minimum speed of 20 km/h.
If problems occur during the relearn
process, control indicator w flashes
for several seconds then illuminates
continuously and (depending on
version) a warning message is
displayed in the Driver Information
Centre.
Driver Information Centre 3 89.

General information
The use of tyre chains or
commercially available liquid tyre
repair kits can impair the function of
the system. Factory-approved tyre
repair kits can be used.
Tyre repair kit 3 159, Tyre chains
3 159.
Operating electronic devices or being
close to facilities using similar wave
frequencies could disrupt the tyre
pressure monitoring system.
Each time the tyres are replaced,
TPMS sensors must be dismounted
and serviced by a workshop.

Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.
Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons, it is
recommended that the tread depth of
the tyres on one axle should not vary
by more than 2 mm.

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear
indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.
If there is more wear at the front than
the rear, swap round front wheels and
rear wheels periodically. Ensure that
the direction of rotation of the wheels
is the same as before.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every six years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and make other vehicle
modifications.
After converting to a different tyre
size, have the label with tyre
pressures replaced.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheels
may lead to accidents and will
invalidate the vehicle type
approval.
Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.

Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.
Tyre chains

Tyre chains are only permitted on the
front wheels.

Vehicle care

159

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

After towing, unscrew the towing eye.
Insert cap.

Insert a screwdriver in the slot at the
side of the cap. Release the cap by
carefully levering the screwdriver. To
prevent damage it is recommended to
place a cloth between the screwdriver
and the frame.

Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use de-icing agent only when
absolutely necessary, as this has a
degreasing effect and impairs lock
function. After using a de-icing agent,
have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select a programme that
includes waxing.
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.

If using a vehicle wash, comply with
the vehicle wash manufacturer's
instructions. The windscreen wiper
and rear window wiper must be
switched off. Remove antenna and
external accessories such as roof
racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of four to nine.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Vehicle care

169
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.

Vehicle care

170
Plastic body parts must not be treated
with wax or polishing agents.
Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with a
soft cloth and window cleaner.
Remove dirt residues from smearing
wiper blades by using a soft cloth and
window cleaner. Also make sure to
remove any residues such as wax,
insect residues and similar from the
window.
Ice residues, pollution and continuous
wiping on dry windows will damage or
even destroy the wiper blades.

Glass panel
Never clean with solvents or abrasive
agents, fuels, aggressive media (e.g.
paint cleaner, acetone-containing
solutions etc.), acidic or highly
alkaline media or abrasive pads. Do
not apply wax or polishing agents to
the glass panel.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.

After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Natural gas system
Do not direct the steam jet or high-
pressure jet towards natural gas
system components. It is particularly
important to protect the natural gas
tank and the pressure valves on the
vehicle underbody and the bulkhead
in the engine compartment.
These components must not be
treated using chemical cleaners or
preservatives.
Have components of the natural gas
system cleaned by a workshop
authorised to carry out maintenance
of natural gas vehicles.

Vehicle care

171

Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument cluster and the
displays should only be cleaned using
a soft damp cloth. If necessary, use a
weak soap solution.
Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-

coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, like zips or
belts or studded jeans.

Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil
ageing control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.

Service and maintenance

173
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
petrol and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities must be used.
Recommendations for petrol engines
are also valid for Compressed Natural
Gas (CNG) fuelled engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 177.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 177.

Service and maintenance

174
Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information on the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 177.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only antifreeze approved for the
vehicle. Consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C. In
regions with very low temperatures,

the factory filled coolant provides frost
protection down to approx. -37 °C.
This concentration should be
maintained all year round.
The use of additional coolant
additives that intend to give additional
corrosion protection or seal against
minor leaks can cause function
problems. Liability for consequences
resulting from the use of additional
coolant additives will be rejected.
Washer fluid
Use only washer fluid approved for
the vehicle to prevent damage of
wiper blades, paintwork, plastic and
rubber parts. Consult a workshop.
Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.

Customer information
Declaration of conformity
Radio transmission systems
This vehicle has systems that
transmit and/or receive radio waves
subject to Directive 2014/53/EU.
These systems are in compliance
with the essential requirements and
other relevant provisions of
Directive 2014/53/EU. Copies of the
original Declarations of Conformity
can be obtained on our website.

Collision damage repair
Paint thickness
Due to production techniques, the
thickness of the paint can vary
between 50 and 400 µm.
Therefore, different paint thickness is
no indicator for a collision damage
repair.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
● operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels)
● status messages of the vehicle
and its single components (e.g.
number of wheel revolutions /
rotational speed, deceleration,
lateral acceleration)

● dysfunctions and defects in

important system components

Customer information

187

● vehicle reactions in particular

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the
stability regulation system)

● environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature)

This data is exclusively technical and
helps identifying and correcting errors
as well as optimizing vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with this
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data is deleted from the
error storage module or it is
constantly overwritten.

When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which technical data
related to other information (accident
report, damages on the vehicle,
witness statements etc.) may be
associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
