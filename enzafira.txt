The seat occupancy recognition
system deactivates the passenger
front and side airbag if the front
passenger seat is not occupied or is
fitted with an Opel child restraint
system with transponders. The
curtain airbag system remains

9 Danger

Only Opel child restraint systems
with transponders should be fitted
on the front passenger seats. Use
of systems without transponders
poses a risk of fatal injury.

Control indicator 3 89.
Note
Anyone weighing less than 35 kg
should only travel on the rear seats.
Do not place any heavy objects on
the front passenger seat. Otherwise
the seat will register as occupied and
the airbag system for the front
passenger seat will not be
deactivated.
Do not use protective covers or seat
cushions on the front passenger
seat.

Child restraints
Child restraint systems
We recommend the Opel child
restraint system which is tailored
specifically to the vehicle.
When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.
Always comply with local or national
regulations. In some countries, the
use of child restraint systems is
forbidden on certain seats.
Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system. Children should
travel facing rearwards in the vehicle
as long as possible. This makes sure
that the child's backbone, which is still
very weak, is under less strain in the
event of an accident.

Seats, restraints

63

Only allow children to enter and exit
the vehicle at the side facing away
from the traffic.
When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.
Note
Do not stick anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.
A child restraint system which has
been subjected to stress in an
accident must be replaced.

Children under the age of 12 years
that are smaller than 150 cm are only
allowed to travel in a restraint system
that is suitable for the child. Suitable
are restraint systems that comply with
ECE 44-03 or ECE 44-04. Since
a proper position of the belt is rarely
possible with a child that is smaller
than 150 cm, we strongly advise to
use an appropriate child restraint
system, even though this might, due
to the age of the child, no longer be
legally binding.
Never hold a child whilst travelling in
the vehicle. The child will become too
heavy to be held in the event of
a collision.
When transporting children, use the
child restraint systems suitable for the
child's weight.
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct.

need a warming phase of approx.
5 minutes. The selector lever must be
in position P respectively N.

Overrun cut-off
The fuel supply is automatically cut off
during overrun, i.e. when the vehicle
is driven with a gear engaged but
accelerator is released.

Parking
■ Do not park the vehicle on an easily

ignitable surface. The high
temperature of the exhaust system
could ignite the surface.

■ Always apply parking brake without
pressing release button. Apply as
firmly as possible on downhill or
uphill slopes. Depress the foot
brake at same time to reduce
operating force.

■ Switch off the engine and ignition.

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving. The filter
is cleaned by burning off the soot
particles at high temperature. This
process takes place automatically
under set driving conditions and may
take up to 25 minutes. Fuel

consumption may be higher during
this period. The emission of smells
and smoke during this process is
normal.

Stopping the journey or switching off
the engine during cleaning is not
recommended.

Caution

If the cleaning process is
interrupted more than once, there
is a great risk of provoking severe
engine damage.

Cleaning takes place quickest at high
engine speeds and loads.

Under certain driving conditions, e.g.
short distances, the system cannot
clean itself automatically.
If the filter requires cleaning and
previous driving conditions did not
enable automatic cleaning, control
indicator ! flashes. Continue driving,
keeping engine speed above 2000
revolutions per minute. Shift down if
necessary. Diesel particle filter
cleaning is then started.

Caution

Fuel grades other than those listed
on pages 3 149, 3 204 could
damage the catalytic converter or
electronic components.
Unburnt petrol will overheat and
damage the catalytic converter.
Therefore avoid excessive use of
the starter, running the fuel tank
dry and starting the engine by
pushing or towing.

In the event of misfiring, uneven
engine running, a reduction in engine
performance or other unusual
problems, have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop as soon as
possible. In an emergency, driving
can be continued for a short period,
keeping vehicle speed and engine
speed low.

Fault

9 Warning

If there is a fault in the ABS, the
wheels may be liable to lock due
to braking that is heavier than
normal. The advantages of ABS
are no longer available. During
hard braking, the vehicle can no
longer be steered and may
swerve.

Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent though
a pulse in the brake pedal and the
noise of the regulation process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting off the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.
Control indicator u 3 91.
Adaptive brake lamp
During full braking, all three brake
lamps flash for the duration of ABS
control.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when you depress the
brake pedal firmly. You need to use
considerably more force for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing your journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
Control indicator R 3 91.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.

button and fully lower the lever.
To reduce the operating forces of the
parking brake, depress the foot brake
at the same time.
Control indicator R 3 91.

Brake assist
If the brake pedal is depressed
quickly and forcefully, maximum
brake force is automatically applied
(full braking).
Maintain steady pressure on the
brake pedal for as long as full braking
is required. Maximum brake force is
automatically reduced when the
brake pedal is released.

Hill start assist
The system helps prevent unintended
movement when driving away on
inclines.
When releasing the foot brake after
stopping on an incline, the brakes
remain on for a further 2 seconds. The
brakes release automatically as soon
as the vehicle begins to accelerate.

Ride control systems
Electronic stability
program
Electronic stability program
(ESP®Plus) improves driving stability
when necessary, regardless of the
type of road surface or tyre grip. It also
prevents the drive wheels from
spinning.
As soon as the vehicle starts to
swerve (understeer/oversteer),
engine output is reduced and the
wheels are braked individually. This
considerably improves the driving
stability of the vehicle on slippery road
surfaces.
ESP®Plus is operational as soon as

Cruise control
The cruise control can store and
maintain speeds of approx.
30 to 200 km/h. Deviations from the
stored speeds may occur when
driving uphill or downhill.
For safety reasons the cruise control
cannot be activated until the foot
brake has been operated once.

The rear level of the vehicle is
automatically adjusted to the load
conditions while driving. Suspension
and ground clearance are increased,
which improves driving conditions.
The automatic level control is
activated after the vehicle has been
driven for some distance, depending
on the vehicle loading and the road
conditions.

Fuel consumption - CO2-
Emissions
The determination of fuel
consumption is regulated by
European directive 80/1268/EEC
(latest edition 2004/3/EC).
The directive is oriented to actual
driving practices: Urban driving is
rated at approx. 1/3 and extra urban
driving with approx. 2/3. Cold starts
and acceleration phases are also
taken into consideration.
The specification of CO2 emission is
also a constituent of the directive.
The figures given must not be taken
as a guarantee for the actual fuel
consumption of a particular vehicle.
Furthermore, fuel consumption is
dependent on personal driving style
as well as road and traffic conditions.

Driving and operating

151

All values are based on the EU base
model with standard equipment.
The calculation of fuel consumption
takes into account the vehicle's kerb
weight, ascertained in accordance
with the regulations. Optional
equipment may result in slightly
higher fuel consumption and
CO2 emission levels and a lower
maximum speed.
Fuel consumption, CO2 emissions
3 208.
Natural gas
The fuel consumption information
was obtained using reference fuel
G20 (methane proportion
99 - 100 mol%) under prescribed
driving conditions. When using
natural gas with a lower proportion of
methane, the fuel consumption can
differ from the specified values.

152

Driving and operating

Towing
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.
Fitting of towing equipment could
cover the opening of the towing eye.
If this is the case use the coupling ball
bar for towing. Always keep the
coupling ball bar in the vehicle.
Installation dimensions of factory-
fitted towing equipment 3 219.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements.

For trailers with low driving stability
and trailers with a permitted gross
vehicle weight of more than 1300 kg
a speed of 80 km/h must not be
exceeded; the use of a stabiliser is
recommended.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 215.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.

The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12 %
The permitted trailer load applies up
to the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10 %
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8 %, e. g. motorways).
The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 200.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.

The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (75 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.
Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) may be exceeded by
90 kg and the gross vehicle weight
rating by 75 kg. If the permissible rear
axle load is exceeded, a maximum
speed of 100 km/h applies.

Run-flat tyres
Run-flat tyres have reinforced, self-
supporting sidewalls, which ensure
that the tyres always have a certain
amount of driveability, even when
there is no pressure.

1) Zafira OPC: Permitted as winter tyres without tyre chains.

Vehicle care

177

Run-flat tyres are only permitted on
vehicles with electronic stability
program and tyre pressure monitoring
system or deflation detection system.

Caution

Check tyre pressures regularly
even if run-flat tyres are fitted.

Depending on tyre manufacturer, run-
flat tyres can be identified from
a marking on the tyre wall. E.g.
ROF = RunonFlat for Goodyear or
SSR = Self Supporting Runflat Tyre

for Continental.

Use of run-flat tyres is only permitted
in combination with factory approved
alloy wheels.
Do not use a tyre repair kit.
The ECO tyre pressure must not be
used.
Run-flat tyres must not be combined
with standard tyres.

Vehicle care

If converting to standard tyres, note
that the vehicle is not equipped with
a spare wheel or tyre repair kit.
Driving with a damaged tyre
A loss in tyre pressure is indicated by
the tyre pressure monitoring system
or the deflation detection system.
If a tyre has no pressure, continued
driving is possible
■ at a speed of max. 80 km/h
■ up to a distance of 80 km

on the inside of the fuel filler flap.
The tyre pressure data refer to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare wheel to the
pressure specified for full load.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible. It must not be
used with run-flat tyres.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The tyre pressure monitoring system
continually checks the pressure of all
four wheels when vehicle speed
exceeds a certain limit.
All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.
Otherwise, the tyre pressure will be
monitored by the deflation detection
system 3 180.
The current tyre pressures can be
shown in the Info-Display 3 109.
Vehicle messages, tyre pressure

After tyre pressure correction or
wheel change, the system must be
initialised: Switch on the ignition,

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear

indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.
If there is more wear at the front than
the rear, swap round front wheels and
rear wheels periodically.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every 6 years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogram the
speedometer and make other vehicle
modifications.

Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use de-icing agent only when
absolutely necessary, as this has
a degreasing effect and impairs lock
function. After using de-icing agent,
have the locks regreased by
a workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic car washes,
select a programme that includes
waxing.
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.

If using a car wash, comply with the
car wash manufacturer's instructions.
The windscreen wipers and rear
window wiper must be switched off.
Remove antenna and external
accessories such as roof racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.
Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.
Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.

Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.
Paintwork polish with silicone forms
a protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Plastic body parts must not be treated
with wax or polishing agents.
Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window,
make sure the heating element inside
is not damaged.

For mechanical removal of ice, use
a sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with
a soft cloth and window cleaner.
Moonroof
Never clean with solvents or abrasive
agents, fuels, aggressive media (e.g.
paint cleaner, acetone-containing
solutions etc.), acidic or highly
alkaline media or abrasive pads. Do
not apply wax or polishing agents to
the middle part of the moonroof.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.

Vehicle care

193

Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by
a workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Engine compartment
Areas of the engine compartment that
are painted in the same colour as the
vehicle must be looked after like any
other painted surface.

194

Vehicle care

It is advisable to wash the engine
compartment before and after winter
and preserve it with wax. Protect the
alternator and brake fluid reservoir
with plastic sheets before washing
the engine.
When washing the engine with
a steam-jet cleaner, do not direct the
steam jet towards components of the
antilock brake system, air
conditioning system or the belt drive
and its components.
After an engine wash, have all engine
room components preserved
thoroughly by a workshop using
protective wax.
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Natural gas system
Do not direct the steam jet or high-
pressure jet towards natural gas
system components. It is particularly
important to protect the natural gas
tank and the pressure valves on the
vehicle underbody and the bulkhead
in the engine compartment.

These components must not be
treated using chemical cleaners or
preservatives.
Have components of the natural gas
system cleaned by a workshop
authorised to carry out maintenance
of natural gas vehicles.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument panel should only be
cleaned using a soft damp cloth.

Clean fabric upholstery with
a vacuum cleaner and brush.
Remove stains with an upholstery
cleaner.
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.

Plastic and rubber parts

poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil

aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
gasoline and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities have to be used.
Recommendations for gasoline
engines are also valid for
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG),
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and
Ethanol (E85) fueled engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 201.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.

Service and maintenance

197

Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 201.
Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 201.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.

Coolant and antifreeze
Use only silicate-free long life coolant
(LLC) antifreeze.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C.
This concentration should be
maintained all year round. The use of
additional coolant additives that
intend to give additional corrosion
protection or seal against minor leaks
can cause function problems. Liability
for consequences resulting from the
use of additional coolant additives will
be rejected.
Brake and clutch fluid
Only use high-performance brake
fluid approved for the vehicle, consult
your workshop.
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.

198

Service and maintenance

Brake fluid should be stored in
a sealed container to avoid water
absorption.
Ensure brake fluid does not become
contaminated.

8 = Vehicle-specific or country-

specific data

The combined total of front and rear
axle loads must not exceed the
permissible gross vehicle weight. For
example, if the front axle is bearing its
maximum permissible load, the rear
axle can only bear a load that is equal
to the gross vehicle weight minus the
front axle load.
The technical data is determined in
accordance with European

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
The vehicle has a number of
sophisticated systems that monitor
and control several vehicle data.
Some data may be stored during
regular operation to facilitate repair of
detected malfunctions, other data is
stored only in a crash or near crash
event by systems commonly called
event data recorders (EDR).
The systems may record data about
the condition of the vehicle and how it
was operated (e.g. engine speed,
brake application, seat belt usage).
To read this data special equipment
and access to the vehicle is required.
This will take place when the vehicle
is serviced in a workshop. Some data
is electronically fed into global
diagnostic systems. The
manufacturer will not access
information about a crash event or
share it with others except

■ with the consent of the vehicle

owner or, if the vehicle is leased,
with the consent of the lessee,

■ in response to an official request of
police or similar government office,

■ as part of the manufacturer’s

defense in case of legal
proceedings,

■ as required by law.
In addition, the manufacturer may use
the collected or received data
■ for the manufacturer's research

needs,

■ to make it available for research

needs where appropriate
confidentiality is maintained and
need is shown,

■ to share summary data which is not
tied to a specific vehicle with other
organisations for research
purposes.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
