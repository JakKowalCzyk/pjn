                                                Eco-driving 

 Eco-driving is a range of everyday practices that allow the motorist to optimise their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

  Optimise the use of your gearbox 

  With a manual gearbox, move off gently, change up without waiting 
and drive by changing up quite soon. If your vehicle has the system,
the gear shift indicator invites you to change up; it is displayed in the 
instrument panel, follow its instructions.

  With an automatic or electronic gearbox, stay in Drive "D" or Auto  "A" , 
according to the type of gearbox, without pressing the accelerator 
pedal heavily or suddenly.   

  Control the use of your electrical
equipment 
  Before moving off, if the passenger compartment is too warm, ventilate it 
by opening the windows and air vents before using the air conditioning. 
 Above 30 mph (50 km/h), close the windows and leave the air vents
open. 
 Remember to make use of equipment that can help keep the temperature
in the passenger compartment down (sunroof and window blinds...). 
 Switch off the air conditioning, unless it has automatic digital regulation, 
as soon as the desired temperature is attained.
 Switch off the demisting and defrosting controls, if not automatic.
 Switch off the heated seat as soon as possible.  

  Drive smoothly 
  Maintain a safe distance between vehicles, use engine braking rather 
than the brake pedal, and press the accelerator progressively. These 
practices contribute towards a reduction in fuel consumption and CO2
emissions and also helps reduce the background traffic noise.

  Switch off the headlamps and front foglamps when the level of light 
does not require their use.  

  Avoid running the engine before moving off, particularly in winter; your 
vehicle will warm up much faster while driving.  

  If your vehicle has cruise control, make use of the system at speeds 
above 25 mph (40 km/h) when the traffic is flowing well.   

  As a passenger, if you avoid connecting your multimedia devices 
(film, music, video game...), you will contribute towards limiting the
consumption of electrical energy, and so of fuel.
 Disconnect your portable devices before leaving the vehicle.   

19

Familiarisation

  Limit the causes of excess consumption 

  Spread loads throughout the vehicle; place the heaviest items in the
bottom of the boot, as close as possible to the rear seats. 
 Limit the loads carried in the vehicle and reduce wind resistance (roof 
bars, roof rack, bicycle carrier, trailer...). Use a roof box in preference. 
 Remove roof bars and roof racks after use.

  Observe the recommendations on
maintenance 
  Check the tyre pressures regularly, when cold, referring to the label in 
the door aperture, driver's side.
 Carry out this check in particular: 
   -  
  -  
  -  
 Don't forget the spare wheel and the tyres on any trailer or caravan.  

before a long journey, 
at each change of season, 
after a long period out of use.  

  At the end of winter, remove snow tyres and refit your summer tyres.   

  Have your vehicle serviced regularly (engine oil, oil filter, air filter...) and
observe the schedule of operations recommended by the manufacturer.

  When refuelling, do not continue after the third cut-off of the nozzle to
avoid any overflow.

  At the wheel of your new vehicle, it is only after the first 1 800 miles 
(3 000 kilometres) that you will see the fuel consumption settle down to
a consistent average.

Air intake 
The air circulating in the passenger compartment

The incoming air follows various paths 
depending on the controls selected by the
driver:

direct arrival in the passenger compartment 
(air intake), 
passage through a heating circuit (heating),
passage through a cooling circuit (air

Comfort

 In order for these systems to be fully effective, follow the operation and maintenance 
guidelines below: 
(cid:41)   To obtain an even air distribution, take care not to obstruct the exterior air intake grilles 
located at the base of the windscreen, the nozzles, the vents and the air outlets, as well
as the air extractor located in the boot. 

(cid:41)   Do not cover the sunshine sensor, located on the dashboard; this is used for regulation 

(cid:41)   Operate the air conditioning system for at least 5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a month

(cid:41)   Ensure that the passenger compartment filter is in good condition and have the filter 

of the digital air conditioning system. 

to keep it in perfect working order. 

elements replaced regularly.  

  We recommend the use of a combined passenger compartment filter. Thanks to its 

special active additive, it contributes to the purification of the air breathed by the
occupants and the cleanliness of the passenger compartment (reduction of allergic 
symptoms, bad odours and greasy deposits).

(cid:41)   To ensure correct operation of the air conditioning system, you are also advised to have

(cid:41)  

it checked regularly as recommended in the servicing booklet. 
If the system does not produce cold air, switch it off and contact a PEUGEOT dealer or 
a qualified workshop.  

 When towing the maximum load on a steep gradient in high temperatures, switching off the
air conditioning increases the available engine power and so improves the towing ability.

3

  If after an extended stop in sunshine, 
the interior temperature is very high, first
ventilate the passenger compartment for 
a few moments.  
Put the air flow control at a setting high 
enough to quickly change the air in the 
passenger compartment. 
 The air conditioning system does not
contain chlorine and does not present 
any danger to the ozone layer.

  The condensation created by the air 
conditioning results in a discharge
of water under the vehicle which is 
perfectly normal.  

   Stop & Start
 The heating and air conditioning systems only work when the engine is running. To maintain
a comfortable temperature in the passenger compartment, you can temporarily deactivate
the Stop & Start system (see the corresponding section).

Operation
The system intervenes only when driving 
economically.
Depending on the driving situation and your 
vehicle's equipment, the system may advise 
you to skip one or more gears. You can 
follow this instruction without engaging the 
intermediate gears.
The gear engagement recommendations must
not be considered compulsory. In fact, the 
configuration of the road, the amount of traffic
and safety remain determining factors when
choosing the best gear. Therefore, the driver 
remains responsible for deciding whether or not
to follow the advice given by the system. 
This function cannot be deactivated.

a substantial knock when changing from P
to  R and from N  to  R . This will not cause any 
damage to the gearbox.
 Do not exceed 60 mph (100 km/h), local speed
restrictions permitting. 
 Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop as soon as possible.

  There is a risk of damage to the
gearbox: 
   -  

if you press the accelerator and 
brake pedals at the same time,
if you force the movement of the gear 
lever from the P  position to another 
position when the battery is flat.

a prolonged standstill with the engine
running (traffic jam...), put the gear lever 
in the  N position and apply the parking
brake.   

            Stop & Start 

 The Stop & Start system puts the engine temporarily into standby - STOP mode - during stops in the traffic (red lights, traffic jams, or other...).
The engine restarts automatically - START mode - as soon as you want to move off. The restart takes place instantly, quickly and silently. 
 Perfect for urban use, the Stop & Start system reduces fuel consumption and exhaust emissions as well as the noise level when stationary.

      Park Assist 

This system provides active assistance with parking, detecting a parking space then controlling the steering to park in the space. 
It controls the steering while the driver manages the accelerator, brakes, gears and clutch (manual gearbox). During phases of entry into and exit from
a parking space, the system provides visual and audible information to the driver in order to make the manoeuvre safe. It may be necessary to move
forwards and backwards more than once. 

The driver can take control at any time by gripping the steering wheel.

  For entry into a parking space (parallel
parking) the system does not detect 
spaces which are clearly much smaller 
or larger than the size of the vehicle.
 This "parking assistance" system
is activated automatically during
manoeuvres; it is therefore possible
that a symbol comes on in the screen, 
accompanied by an audible signal,
without affecting the manoeuvre.

  The Park Assist system cannot in any
circumstances replace the care and 
responsibility of the driver.
 The driver must remain in control of 
their vehicle ensuring that the space 
remains clear during the manoeuvre.
 In some circumstances, the sensors 
may not detect small obstacles located 
in their blind spots.

During a manoeuvre the steering wheel 
turns quickly: do not hold the steering 
wheel, do not place your hand between 
the spokes of the steering wheel and
take care with loose and bulky clothing,
scarves, handbags... There is a risk of 
injury.

When Park Assist is activated, it 
prevents a change to STOP mode of 
Stop & Start. In STOP mode, activation
of Park Assist restarts the engine.

  Operating faults 

In the event of a fault with the
system, this warning lamp is

displayed in the instrument panel and/or a 
message appears in the screen, accompanied
by an audible signal (short beep). 
 The indicator lamp in the control flashes for a
few seconds. If the problem occurs while using 
the system, the indicator lamp goes off. 

In the event of a fault with
the power steering, these
warning lamps come on in
the instrument panel. 

 Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.

  If the lateral distance between your vehicle 
and the space is too great, the system may
not be able to measure the space.
 Anything projecting beyond the envelope of 
the vehicle (long or wide load) is not taken 
into account by the Park Assist system
during a manoeuvre.  

  In bad weather and in winter, ensure 
that the sensors are not covered by

 The system is switched off when you exit 
reverse gear.

This system indicates the proximity of an
obstacle (person, vehicle, tree, gate, etc.) which 
comes within the field of detection of sensors
located in the bumper.
Certain types of obstacle (stake, roadworks 
cone, etc.) detected initially will no longer be 
detected at the end of the manoeuvre due to 
the presence of blind spots.  

  This function cannot, in any 
circumstances, take the place of the 
vigilance and responsibility of the driver.   

106

  Audible assistance 
 The proximity information is given by an 
intermittent audible signal, the frequency of which 
increases as the vehicle approaches the obstacle.
 The sound emitted by the speaker (right or left) 
indicates the side on which the obstacle is located.
 When the distance between the vehicle and 
the obstacle becomes less than approximately
thirty centimetres, the audible signal becomes 
continuous.   

   Visual assistance 
 This supplements the audible signal by
displaying bars in the multifunction screen
which move progressively nearer to the vehicle.
When the obstacle is near, the "Danger"
symbol is displayed in the screen.

                              Electronic stability programme (ESP) 

Safety

 Electronic Stability Programme incorporating
the following systems: 
   -  

the anti-lock braking system (ABS) and the 
electronic brake force distribution (EBFD),
the emergency braking assistance,
the anti-slip regulation (ASR) or traction
control, 
the dynamic stability control (DSC).  

  -  
  -  

  -  

Definitions 
Anti-lock braking system (ABS)
and electronic brake force
distribution (EBFD) 
This system improves the stability and 
manoeuvrability of your vehicle when braking 
and provides improved control in corners, in 
particular on poor or slippery road surfaces.
The ABS prevents wheel lock in the event of 
emergency braking.
The electronic brake force distribution system 
manages the braking pressure wheel by wheel.  

  Anti-slip regulation (ASR) 
 The ASR system (also known as Traction 
Control) optimises traction in order to avoid
wheel slip by acting on the brakes of the driving
wheels and on the engine. It also improves 
the directional stability of the vehicle on
acceleration.  

Emergency braking assistance
In an emergency, this system enables you to 
reach the optimum braking pressure more 
quickly and therefore reduce the stopping 
distance. 
It is triggered in relation to the speed at which 
the brake pedal is pressed. This is felt by a 
reduction in the resistance of the pedal and an 
increase in the effectiveness of the braking.

  Dynamic stability control (DSC) 
 If there is a difference between the path 
followed by the vehicle and that required by
the driver, the DSC monitors each wheel and
automatically acts on the brake of one or more 
wheels and on the engine to return the vehicle 
to the required path, within the limits of the laws 
of physics.   

6

127

When changing wheels (tyres and rims), 
make sure that these are approved for 
your vehicle. 
Normal operation of the ABS may make
itself felt by slight vibrations of the brake
pedal.  

In emergency braking, press 
very firmly without releasing
the pressure.

Safety

Operation
Anti-lock braking system (ABS)
and electronic brake force 
distribution (EBFD)

 When this warning lamp comes on,

there is a fault with the ABS, which

could cause loss of control of the vehicle when 
braking.  

  When this warning lamp comes on,
coupled with the STOP  warning lamp, 
accompanied by an audible signal 
and a message, it indicates that 

there is a fault with the electronic brake force 
distribution (EBFD), which could cause loss of 
control of the vehicle when braking.
You must stop as soon as it is safe to do so.
In both cases, contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a
qualified workshop.

   Deactivation
 In exceptional conditions (starting a vehicle
which is bogged down, stuck in snow, on soft 
ground...), it may be advisable to deactivate
the DSC system, so that the wheels can move 
freely and regain grip. 

Reactivation 
The system is reactivated automatically each
time the ignition is switched back on or from 
30 mph (50 km/h).
(cid:41)   Press the switch again to reactivate it

manually.

Safety

  Operating fault 

If this warning lamp comes on,
accompanied by an audible signal
and a message in the screen, this 
indicates a fault with the system.
 Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop to have the system checked.  

  The DSC system offers exceptional 
safety in normal driving, but this should 
not encourage the driver to take extra 
risks or drive at high speed.
 The correct operation of the system 
depends on observation of the 
manufacturer's recommendations
regarding the wheels (tyres and rims),
the braking components, the electronic 
components and the PEUGEOT 
assembly and operation procedures. 
 After an impact, have the system
checked by a PEUGEOT dealer or a 
qualified workshop.

Depending on the severity of the impact, the
pretensioning system instantly tightens the seat
belts against the body of the occupants.
The pretensioning seat belts are active when 
the ignition is on. 
The force limiter reduces the pressure of the

131

Safety

     The driver must ensure that passengers use
the seat belts correctly and that they are all
restrained securely before setting off.
 Wherever you are seated in the vehicle, 
always fasten your seat belt, even for short 
journeys. 
 Do not interchange the seat belt buckles as 
they will not fulfil their role fully. 
 The seat belts are fitted with an inertia reel 
permitting automatic adjustment of the length 
of the strap to your size. The seat belt is
stowed automatically when not in use.
 Before and after use, ensure that the seat
belt is reeled in correctly. 
 The lower part of the strap must be 
positioned as low as possible on the pelvis.
 The upper part must be positioned in the 
hollow of the shoulder. 
 The inertia reels are fitted with an automatic 
locking device which comes into operation in
the event of a collision, emergency braking 
or if the vehicle rolls over. You can release 
the device by pulling firmly on the strap and 
releasing it so that it reels in slightly. 

132

  -  

 In order to be effective, a seat belt must: 
be tightened as close to the body as 
   -  
possible,
be pulled in front of you with a smooth 
movement, checking that it does not
twist,
be used to restrain only one person, 
not bear any trace of cuts or fraying, 
not be converted or modified to avoid
affecting its performance.  

  -  
  -  
  -  

 In accordance with current safety
regulations, for all repairs on your vehicle, 
go to a qualified workshop with the skills 
and equipment needed, which a PEUGEOT 
dealer is able to provide.
 Have your seat belts checked regularly by a 
PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop, 
particularly if the straps show signs of 
damage. 
 Clean the seat belt straps with soapy
water or a textile cleaning product, sold by 
PEUGEOT dealers. 
 After folding or moving a seat or rear bench
seat, ensure that the seat belt is positioned 
and reeled in correctly.  

Recommendations for children
Use a suitable child seat if the passenger is 
less than 12 years old or shorter than one 
and a half metres.
Never use the same seat belt to secure more 
than one person. 
Never allow a child to travel on your lap.  

In the event of an impact 
Depending on the nature and 
seriousness of the impact , the
pretensioning device may be deployed
before and independently of the airbags.
Deployment of the pretensioners is
accompanied by a slight discharge of 
harmless smoke and a noise, due to the
activation of the pyrotechnic cartridge 
incorporated in the system. 
In all cases, the airbag warning lamp comes
on. 
Following an impact, have the seat belts 
system checked, and if necessary replaced,
by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.   

 Airbags 

  System designed to maximise the safety of the 
occupants (with the exception of the rear centre
passenger) in the event of violent collisions.
The airbags supplement the action of the force-
limiting seat belts (with the exception of the 
centre rear passenger).
 If a collision occurs, the electronic detectors
record and analyse the front and side impacts 
sustained in the impact detection zones:
   -  

in the case of a serious impact, the airbags
are deployed instantly and contribute 
towards better protection of the occupants 
of the vehicle (with the exception of the rear 
centre passenger); immediately after the
impact, the airbags deflate rapidly so that
they do not hinder visibility or the exit of the 
occupants,
in the case of a minor or rear impact
or in certain roll-over conditions, the
airbags will not be deployed; the seat belt
alone contributes towards ensuring your 
protection in these situations.  

  -  

The airbags do not operate when the 
ignition is switched off.
 This equipment will only deploy once. 
If a second impact occurs (during the
same or a subsequent accident), the 
airbag will not be deployed again.

Safety

Front airbags 

Impact detection zones

incorporated in the system.
This smoke is not harmful, but sensitive
individuals may experience slight 
irritation. 
The noise of the detonation may result
in a slight loss of hearing for a short
time.

 System which protects the driver and front
passenger in the event of a serious front impact 
in order to limit the risk of injury to the head and

  Deployment 
 The airbags are deployed, except the passenger's 
front airbag if it has been deactivated, in the event
of a serious front impact to all or part of the front 
impact zone  A , in the longitudinal centreline of the
vehicle on a horizontal plane and directed from the
front to the rear of the vehicle.
 The front airbag inflates between the thorax and 
head of the front occupant of the vehicle and the 
steering wheel, driver's side, and the dashboard,
passenger's side to cushion their forward

 Never remove or pierce the steering wheel or 
hit it violently.

 Sit in a normal upright position.
 Wear a correctly adjusted seat belt.
 Do not leave anything between the
occupants and the airbags (a child, pet,
object...). This could hamper the operation of 
the airbags or injure the occupants. 
 After an accident or if the vehicle has been
stolen or broken into, have the airbag
systems checked.
 All work on the airbag system must be 
carried out by a PEUGEOT dealer or a 
qualified workshop. 
 Even if all of the precautions mentioned 
are observed, a risk of injury or of minor 
burns to the head, chest or arms when an 
airbag is deployed cannot be ruled out. The
bag inflates almost instantly (within a few 
milliseconds) then deflates within the same
time discharging the hot gas via openings 
provided for this purpose. 

Lateral airbags
Use only approved covers on the seats, 
compatible with the deployment the lateral 
airbags. For information on the range of seat
covers suitable for your vehicle, you can 
contact a PEUGEOT dealer. 
Refer to the "Accessories" section.
Do not fix or attach anything to the seat 
backs (clothing...). This could cause injury
to the chest or arms if the lateral airbag is
deployed.
Do not sit with the upper part of the body any
nearer to the door than necessary.   

   Curtain airbags 
 Do not fix or attach anything to the roof. This
could cause injury to the head if the curtain 
airbag is deployed. 
 If fitted on your vehicle, do not remove the
grab handles installed on the roof, they play 
a part in securing the curtain airbags.

         General points relating to child seats  

  Although one of PEUGEOT main criteria when designing your vehicle, the safety of your children 
also depends on you.  

  For maximum safety, please observe the 
following recommendations: 
   -  

in accordance with European regulations,
all children under the age of 12 or less 
than one and a half metres tall must
travel in approved child seats suited to 
their weight , on seats fitted with a seat 
belt or ISOFIX mountings * ,
statistically, the safest seats in your 
vehicle for carrying children are the 
rear seats,
 a child weighing less than 9 kg must
travel in the "rearwards-facing" position 
both in the front and in the rear.

-

  -  

PEUGEOT recommends  that children
should travel in the  outer rear seats of 
your vehicle: 
-
-  

"rearwards-facing"  up to the age of 2, 
 "forwards-facing"  over the age of 2.   

*    The rules for carrying children are specific to
each country. Refer to the legislation in force 
in your country.

         Child seat in the front  

"Rearwards-facing"
When a "rearwards-facing" child seat is 
installed on the  front passenger seat, it
is essential that the passenger airbag is 
deactivated. Otherwise,  the child would 
risk being seriously injured or killed if the 
airbag were to inflate.

  "Forwards-facing" 
 When a "forwards-facing" child seat is installed 
on the  front passenger seat, adjust the 
vehicle's seat to the fully back and highest 
position with the seat back upright and leave
the passenger's airbag activated.  

Passenger seat in the fully back and
highest position.

Ensure that the seat belt is correctly
tensioned.
Ensure that the child seat is not in
contact with a part of the vehicle other 
than the passenger seat.   

138

   Passenger airbag OFF  

Refer to the advice given on the label present 
on both sides of the passenger's sun visor.  

  To assure the safety of your child, you must deactivate the passenger's front airbag when
you install a child seat in the rearwards facing position on the front passenger's seat. 
 Otherwise, there is a risk that the child could be seriously injured or killed if the airbag were
deployed.

Safety

     Advice on child seats 

 The incorrect installation of a child seat in a 
vehicle compromises the child's protection in
the event of an accident.
 Ensure that there is no seat belt or seat belt 
buckle under the child seat, as this could 
destabilise it. 
 Remember to fasten the seat belts or the 
child seat harnesses keeping the slack
relative to the child's body to a minimum,
even for short journeys. 
 When installing a child seat using the seat 
belt, ensure that the seat belt is tightened
correctly on the child seat and that it secures
the child seat firmly on the seat of your 
vehicle. If your passenger seat is adjustable,
move it forwards if necessary.
 At rear seating positions, always leave
sufficient space between the front seat and: 
   -  
  -  

a "rearwards facing" child seat,
the child's feet for a child seat fitted
"forwards facing".

 To do this, move the front seat forwards 
and, if necessary, move its backrest into the
upright position. 
 For optimum installation of the "forwards-
facing" child seat, ensure that the back of the
child seat is in contact with the back of the 
vehicle's seat and remove the head restraint. 
 Ensure that the head restraint is stored or 
attached securely to prevent it from being 
thrown around the vehicle in the event of 
sharp braking. Refit it if an adult uses the 
seating position. 
 Children under the age of 10 must not travel 
in the "forwards-facing" position on the front
passenger seat, unless the rear seats are 
already occupied by other children, cannot 
be used or are absent.
 Deactivate the passenger airbag when a 
"rearwards-facing" child seat is installed on 
the front seat.
 Otherwise, the child would risk being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag were 
to inflate.  

142

Installing a booster seat 
The chest part of the seat belt must be
positioned on the child's shoulder without 
touching the neck.
Ensure that the lap part of the seat belt 
passes correctly over the child's thighs.
PEUGEOT recommends the use of a booster 
seat which has a back, fitted with a seat belt
guide at shoulder level.
 As a safety precaution, do not leave: 
-  

a child or children alone and
unsupervised in a vehicle, 
a child or an animal in a vehicle which 
is exposed to the sun, with the windows
closed, 
the keys within reach of children inside
the vehicle.

-  

-  

To prevent accidental opening of the doors 
and rear windows, use the "Child lock". 
Take care not to open the rear windows by
more than one third.
To protect young children from the rays of 
the sun, fit side blinds on the rear windows.

                     "ISOFIX" mountings 

 Your vehicle has been approved in accordance 
with the  new  ISOFIX  regulation . 
 The seats, represented below, are fitted with 
regulation ISOFIX mountings:

-  

a ring B  behind the seat for fixing the upper 
strap, referred to as the  Top Tether.r

 There are three rings for each seat:
   -  

two rings  A , located between the vehicle
seat back and cushion, indicated by a label, 

Safety

 This ISOFIX mounting system provides fast,
reliable and safe fitting of the child seat in your 
vehicle. 
 When fitting an ISOFIX child seat to the left
hand rear seat, before fitting the seat, first
move the centre rear seat belt towards the
middle of the vehicle, so as to avoid the seat 
interfering with the operation of the seat belt.
 The  ISOFIX child seats  are fitted with two 
latches which are secured on the two rings A.
 Some seats also have an upper strap, known 
as the Top Tether, which is attached to ring  B.
 To attach this strap, raise or remove the vehicle
seat's head restraint then pass the strap over 
the backrest. Attach the strap by its hook on
ring B and then fully tighten the upper strap. 

 The incorrect installation of a child seat
in a vehicle compromises the child's 
protection in the event of an accident. 

 For information regarding the ISOFIX child 
seats which can be installed in your vehicle,
refer to the table showing the locations for 
installing ISOFIX child seats.

  Avoid driving on roads that have been 
cleared of snow, to avoid damaging your 
vehicle's tyres and the road surface. It 
is recommended that before you leave,
you practise fitting the snow chains on
a level and dry surface. If your vehicle
is fitted with alloy wheels, check that
no part of the chain or its fixings is in 
contact with the wheel rim.   

Take account of the legislation in force
in your country on the use of snow 
chains and the maximum running speed 
authorised.

  Front lamps  

Practical information

 The headlamps are fitted with 
polycarbonate glass with a protective
coating:
(cid:41) do not clean them using a dry 

or abrasive cloth, nor with a 
detergent or solvent product,

(cid:41)   use a sponge and soapy water or a

pH neutral product,

(cid:41)   when using a high pressure washer 

on persistent marks, do not keep 
the lance directed towards the
lamps or their edges for too long, 
so as not to damage their protective
coating and seals,

(cid:41)   do not touch the bulb directly with
your fingers, use lint-free cloths. 

Changing a bulb should only be done
after the headlamp has been switched 
off for a few minutes (risk of serious 
burns). 
It is imperative to use only anti-
ultraviolet (UV) type bulbs in order not
to damage the headlamp. 
 Always replace a failed bulb with a 
new bulb with the same type and
specification.

  Procedure for having your vehicle towed or for towing another vehicle using a removable towing eye.  
  Access to the tools

General recommendations 
Observe the legislation in force in your country. 
Ensure that the weight of the towing vehicle is higher than that of the towed vehicle. 
The person at the wheel of the towed vehicle must have a valid driving licence.
When towing a vehicle with all four wheels on the ground, always use an approved towing
bar; rope and straps are prohibited. 
When towing a vehicle with the engine off, there is no longer any power assistance for 
braking or steering. 

In the following cases, you must always call on a professional recovery service:

         Towing a trailer  

Practical information

  Towbar suitable for the attachment of a
trailer or installation of a bicycle carrier, with 
additional lighting and signalling.

  Your vehicle is primarily designed for 
transporting people and luggage, but it may
also be used for towing a trailer.  

We recommend the use of genuine
PEUGEOT towbars and their harnesses
that have been tested and approved 
from the design stage of your vehicle, 
and that the fitting of the towbar is 
entrusted to a PEUGEOT dealer or a 
qualified workshop.
If the towbar is not fitted by a 
PEUGEOT dealer, it is imperative that it 
is fitted in accordance with the vehicle
manufacturer's instructions.

  Driving with a trailer places greater 
demands on the towing vehicle and the 
driver must take particular care.

7

181

Practical information

Driving advice 
Distribution of loads
(cid:41) Distribute the load in the trailer so that the
heaviest items are as close as possible to
the axle and the nose weight approaches the 
maximum permitted without exceeding it. 

 Air density decreases with altitude, thus 
reducing engine performance. Above 
1 000 metres, the maximum towed load must 
be reduced by 10 % for every 1 000 metres of 
altitude.

Refer to the "Technical data" section for details 
of the weights and towed loads which apply to 
your vehicle.

Side wind 
(cid:41) Take into account the increased sensitivity 

to side wind.

182

  Cooling
 Towing a trailer on a slope increases the
temperature of the coolant. 
 As the fan is electrically controlled, its cooling 
capacity is not dependent on the engine speed.
(cid:41)   To lower the engine speed, reduce your 

speed.

 The maximum towed load on a long incline
depends on the gradient and the ambient 
temperature.
 In all cases, keep a check on the coolant
temperature.

  Braking 
 Towing a trailer increases the braking distance. 
 To avoid overheating of the brakes on a long
mountain type of descent, the use of engine 
braking is recommended.

  Tyres
(cid:41) Check the tyre pressures of the towing
vehicle and of the trailer, observing the 
recommended pressures.   

(cid:41) If the warning lamp and the

STOP  warning lamp come on, 
stop the vehicle and switch off 
the engine as soon as possible.   

  Lighting
(cid:41) Check the electrical lighting and signalling 

on the trailer.

  The rear parking sensors will be 
deactivated automatically if a genuine 
PEUGEOT towbar is used.   

            Fitting roof bars  

  When fitting transverse roof bars, take care to 
position them correctly on the retaining pins
located in the door apertures.

Practical information

Use accessories recommended 
by PEUGEOT observing the
manufacturer's recommendations and 
fitting instructions so as to avoid the 
risk of damaging the body (deformation, 
scratches, ...).

  Maximum authorised weight on the roof 
rack, for a loading height not exceeding 
40 cm (with the exception of bicycle 
carriers): 65  kg 
 If the height exceeds 40 cm, adapt the
speed of the vehicle to the profile of the 
road to avoid damaging the roof bars
and the fixings on the roof. 
 Be sure to refer to national legislation in 
order to comply with the regulations for 
transporting objects which are longer 
than the vehicle.

Practical information

               Advice on care and maintenance 

Recommendations on the care and maintenance your vehicle are given in the servicing booklet.  
Matt paint 
If you vehicle is finished with a clear matt
lacquer, please observe the following
recommendations to avoid damaging the
paintwork by the use of an inappropriate 
cleaning procedures. 
These recommendations are also valid for alloy 
road wheels finished with clear matt lacquer.

Never clean the vehicle without water. 
Never wash your vehicle in an 
automatic roller brush car wash.
Never polish the vehicle body, nor the 
alloy wheels. Doing this will make the 
paintwork shiny.
Do not use paint cleaners, abrasive 
products or paint polishing or preserving 
products (such as wax, for example) on
the paintwork. These products are only 
suitable for bright finishes. Application 
of these products on vehicles with a
matt finish will seriously damage the
paint surface of the vehicle, giving rise 
to irreversible shiny or stained areas.
Never use a high pressure jet wash with
a lance fitted with a brush, this may 
scratch the paintwork. 
Never select a wash programme that 
finishes with a hot wax cycle.  

  We recommend the use of a high pressure
jet wash, or at least a water hose with a high 
output.
 We recommend that the vehicle be rinsed using 
de-ionised water. 
 Use only a microfibre cloth to dry the vehicle.
It must be clean and used without heavy 
pressure.
 Lightly wipe off any fuel stains present on the
bodywork using a soft cloth, then leave to dry. 
 From the range of cleaning and maintenance
products in the "TECHNATURE" range 
recommended and approved by PEUGEOT, 
use only the insect remover and car shampoo, 
which are the only products to be used on the 
bodywork. 
 The insect remover can also be used to remove
minor marks (for example: finger marks...).
 Always have paint repairs done by a PEUGEOT 
dealer or a qualified workshop.

Fuel tank capacity: approximately 50 litres.
  Low fuel level

Filling  

When the fuel tank minimum level is 
reached this warning lamp comes on 
in the instrument panel. There remains 
approximately 5 litres  of fuel in the 
tank. When the warning lamp flashes,
there is very little fuel left . 

 You must refuel as soon as possible to avoid 
running out of fuel.
 If you run out of fuel (Diesel), refer to the 
"Running out of fuel - Diesel" section.  

 A self-adhesive label on the inner face of the 
filler flap reminds you of the type of fuel to use 
depending on your engine.
 Additions of fuel must be of at least 5 litres to
be registered by the fuel gauge.

 To fill the tank safely: 
(cid:41) the engine must be switched off,
(cid:41)   open the fuel filler flap, 
(cid:41)  

insert the key in the cap, then turn it to the
left, 

The key cannot be removed from the 
lock until the cap is refitted. 
Removing the filler cap may cause an
inrush of air. This vacuum is perfectly 
normal and results from the sealing of 
the system.   

(cid:41)  

(cid:41)  

remove the cap and hook it onto the clip 
located on the inside of the flap,
fill the tank, but do not continue after the 
3rd cut-off of the pump; this could cause 
malfunctions.

When you have filled the tank: 
(cid:41) put the cap back in place,
(cid:41) turn the key to the right, then remove it 

from the cap,
(cid:41) close the flap.

If you have put in the wrong fuel for 
the engine of your vehicle, you must 
have the fuel tank drained and filled
with the correct fuel before starting 
the engine.

                  Misfuel prevention (Diesel) *  

 Mechanical device which prevents filling the tank of a Diesel vehicle with petrol. It avoids the risk of engine damage that can result from filling with the
wrong fuel.
 Located in the filler neck, the misfuel prevention device appears when the filler cap is removed.

Checks

  Operation
 When a petrol filler nozzle is introduced into the
fuel filler neck of your Diesel vehicle, it comes 
into contact with the flap. The system remains
closed and prevents filling.
Do not persist but introduce a Diesel type 
filler nozzle.

It remains possible to use a fuel can to
fill the tank.  
In order to ensure a good flow of fuel,
do not place the nozzle of the fuel can 
in direct contact with the flap of the 
misfuel prevention device and pour 
slowly. 

  *   According to country of sale.  

   Travelling abroad 
 As Diesel fuel pump nozzles may 
be different in other countries, the
presence of the misfuel prevention 
device may make refuelling impossible. 
 Before travelling abroad, we
recommend that you check with the 
PEUGEOT dealer network, whether 
your vehicle is suitable for the fuel 
pumps in the country in which you want 
to travel.

Quality of the fuel used for 
petrol engines 
The petrol engines are perfectly compatible 
with E10 or E24 type petrol biofuels (containing
10 % or 24 % ethanol), conforming to European
standards EN 228 and EN 15376. 
E85 type fuels (containing up to 85 % ethanol) 
are reserved exclusively for vehicles marketed 
for the use of this type of fuel (BioFlex 
vehicles). The quality of the ethanol must
comply with European standard EN 15293.
For Brazil only, special vehicles are marketed
to run on fuels containing up to 100 % ethanol 
(E100 type).

Quality of the fuel used for 
Diesel engines 
  The Diesel engines are perfectly compatible
with biofuels which conform to current and
future European standards (Diesel fuel which
complies with standard EN 590 mixed with a
biofuel which complies with standard EN 14214)
available at the pumps (containing up to 7 %
Fatty Acid Methyl Ester).
 The B30 biofuel can be used in certain Diesel 
engines; however, this use is subject to strict 
application of the special servicing conditions.
Contact a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop. 
 The use of any other type of (bio)fuel 
(vegetable or animal oils, pure or diluted, 
domestic fuel...) is strictly prohibited (risk of

       Checking levels  

If a level drops significantly, have the corresponding system checked by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop. 
Check all of these levels regularly, in line with the servicing booklet and the requirements of the warranties. Top them up if necessary, unless otherwise indicated. 

  Take care when working under the bonnet, as certain areas of the engine may be extremely hot (risk of burns) and the cooling fan could start at
any time (even with the ignition off).   

Oil level

  The check is carried out either when 
the ignition is switched on using the
oil level indicator in the instrument 
panel, or using the dipstick. 

It will only be correct if the vehicle is on level 
ground and the engine has been off for more 
than 30 minutes.

  Engine oil change
 Refer to the servicing and warranty booklet for 
details of the interval for this operation. 
 In order to maintain the reliability of the engine 
and emission control system, the use of 
additives in the engine oil is prohibited.

 It is normal to top up the oil level
between two services (or oil changes). 
PEUGEOT recommends that you check 
the level, and top up if necessary, every
3 000 miles (5 000 kms). 

  Oil speciﬁ cation 
 The oil must be the correct grade for your 
engine and conform to the manufacturer's
recommendations.   

 After topping up the oil, the check when
switching on the ignition with the oil level
indicator in the instrument panel is not valid
during the 30 minutes after topping up.

196

Brake fluid level 

 The brake fluid level should be close 
to the "MAX" mark. If it is not, check
the brake pad wear.

  Changing the ﬂ uid
 Refer to the servicing and warranty booklet for 
details of the interval for this operation.

  Fluid speciﬁ cation 
 The brake fluid must conform to the
manufacturer's recommendations and meet the 
DOT3 or DOT4 standard.   

Checks

Changing the coolant 
The coolant does not have to be changed.  

Screenwash fluid level

Top up the level when necessary.

Fluid speciﬁ cation 
The coolant must conform to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.   

  Fluid speciﬁ cation
 For optimum cleaning and to avoid freezing, 
this fluid must not be topped up or replaced
with plain water.

Coolant level 

The coolant level should be close 
to the "MAX" mark but should never 
exceed it. 

 When the engine is warm, the temperature of 
the coolant is regulated by the fan.

The cooling fan may start after switching
off the engine: take care with articles and
clothing that might become caught by the
fan blades.

 In addition, as the cooling system is 
pressurised, wait at least one hour after 
switching off the engine before carrying out any
work. 
 To avoid any risk of scalding, unscrew the cap 
by two turns to allow the pressure to drop.
When the pressure has dropped, remove the
cap and top up the level.

Topping up 
This additive must be topped up by a 
PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop 
without delay.

        Used products 

 Avoid prolonged contact of used oil or 
fluids with the skin. 
Most of these fluids are harmful to 
health or indeed very corrosive.

12 V battery

Air filter and passenger compartment filter 

Checks

The battery does not require any maintenance. 
However, check that the terminals are clean 
and correctly tightened, particularly in summer 
and winter. 

 When carrying out work on the battery, refer 
to the "Practical information" section for 
details of the precautions to be taken before 
disconnecting the battery and following its
reconnection.  

The presence of this label, in particular with 
the Stop & Start system, indicates the use of 
a specific 12 V lead-acid battery with special
technology and specification. The involvement 
of a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified workshop 
is essential when replacing or disconnecting 
the battery.  

  Refer to the servicing and warranty
booklet for details of the replacement 
intervals for these components.

Depending on the environment (e.g. dusty
atmosphere) and the use of the vehicle
(e.g. city driving), replace them twice as often
if necessary.y
 A clogged passenger compartment filter may 
have an adverse effect on the performance 
of the air conditioning system and generate
undesirable odours.

Oil filter 

 Replace the oil filter each time the
engine oil is changed.
 Refer to the servicing and warranty
booklet for details of the replacement 
interval for this component.

Particle emissions filter (Diesel)
 The start of saturation of the particle 
filter is indicated by the fixed 
illumination of this warning lamp
accompanied by a warning message 
in the screen (if a display screen is
fitted). 

 As soon as the traffic conditions permit, 
regenerate the filter by driving at a speed of at 
least 40 mph (60 km/h) until the warning lamp 
goes off.
 If the warning lamp stays on, this indicates a
low additive level. 

  On a new vehicle, the first particle
filter regeneration operations may be
accompanied by a "burnt" smell, which 
is perfectly normal.
 Following prolonged operation of the
vehicle at very low speed or at idle, 
you may, in exceptional circumstances, 
notice the emission of water vapour at
the exhaust on acceleration. This does 
not affect the behaviour of the vehicle or 
the environment.

Brake wear depends on the style
of driving, particularly in the case
of vehicles used in town, over short 
distances. It may be necessary to have
the condition of the brakes checked, 
even between vehicle services. 
Unless there is a leak in the circuit, a
drop in the brake fluid level indicates 
that the brake pads are worn.

  Brake disc wear 

For information on checking brake
disc wear, contact a PEUGEOT
dealer or a qualified workshop.  

  If excessive travel or a loss of 
effectiveness of this system is 
noticed, the parking brake must be 
checked, even between two services. 
 Checking this system must be done 
by a PEUGEOT dealer or a qualified 
workshop.   

                 Only use products recommended by 
PEUGEOT or products of equivalent
quality and specification. 
 In order to optimise the operation
of units as important as the braking 
system, PEUGEOT selects and offers
very specific products.
 After washing the vehicle, dampness,
or in wintry conditions, ice, can form 
on the brake discs and pads: braking 
efficiency may be reduced. Make light
brake applications to dry and defrost 
the brakes.

  The system is protected in such a way that it will only
operate in your vehicle.  

  For safety reasons, the driver must carry out operations
which require prolonged attention while the vehicle is 
stationary. 
 When the engine is switched off and to prevent 
discharging of the battery, the system switches off 
following the activation of the energy economy mode.

PEUGEOT CONNECT APPS 

   With "PEUGEOT CONNECT APPS", the driver travels around while having access to useful information such as the state of the trafﬁ c, the
availability of parking places, tourist sites, weather conditions, correct addresses… 
 This service includes access to the mobile network associated with the use of these applications. It is available according to country,
subscription contract and the version of touch screen.  

  Plug the "PEUGEOT CONNECT" connection key into one the the
USB ports for access to the applications via the touch screen.

These intelligent applications use
vehicle data such as the current
speed, mileage, remaining fuel 
range or even GPS position to
provide useful information.

  Using "Plug & Play", the key is recognised automatically and allows 
display of the interface giving access to the applications.  

  For obvious safety reasons, some functions can only be used when
stationary.

The "MyPeugeot" application is a
link between the user, PEUGEOT
and the dealer network. 
It allows the customer to know
everything about their vehicle:
handbook, servicing booklet,
accessory range, contracts taken
out.
It also makes possible the sending 
of the vehicle's mileage to the 
"MyPeugeot" site, or to identify a 
dealer.

  INFORMATION AND ADVICE

  The audio equipment will only play audio ﬁ les with ".wma, .aac, 
.ﬂ ac, .ogg and. mp3" ﬁ le extensions and with a bit rate of between
32 Kbps and 320 Kbps.
 It also supports VBR (Variable Bit Rate) mode.
 No other type of ﬁ le (.mp4...) can be played.
 WMA ﬁ les must be of the standard wma 9 type.
 The sampling rates supported are 11, 22, 44 and 48 KHz.

®

 The system supports USB mass storage or 
Apple®  players via the USB port (adaptor cable 
not supplied). 
 Control of the peripheral device is with the
audio system controls.
 Other peripherals, not recognised on
connection, must be connected to the auxiliary 
socket using a Jack cable (not supplied).  

  It is advisable to restrict ﬁ le names to 20 characters, without using of 
special characters (e.g.: " " ? ; ù) to avoid any playing and displaying
problems.

  In order to be able to play a recorded CDR or CDRW, when
recording it is preferable to select the ISO 9660 level 1, 2 or Joliet
standard.
 If the disc is recorded in another format it may not be played
correctly. 
 It is recommended that the same recording standard is always used 
for an individual disc, with as low a speed as possible (4x maximum)
for optimum sound quality.
 In the particular case of a multi-session CD, the Joliet standard is
recommended.

 In order to be read, a USB memory stick must be formatted FAT 16
or 32. 

 The system does not support the operation of two identical devices
connected at the same time (two memory sticks, two Apple ® players) 
but it is possible to connect one memory stick and one Apple ® player 
at the same time.  

 It is recommended that ofﬁ cial Apple®  USB cables are used to
ensure correct operation.

   On-board audio: Arkamys©  Sound Staging.
With Sound Staging, the driver and passengers are immersed in an 
"audio scene" recreating the natural atmosphere of an auditorium: 
truly a part of the scene and its surroundings.
This new sensation is made possible by software in the audio
system which processes the digital signals from the media players 
(radio, CD, MP3…) without changing the audio settings. This 
processing takes account of the characteristics of the passenger 
compartment to produce optimum results.
 The Arkamys© software installed in your audio system processes 
the digital signal from the media players (radio, CD, MP3, ...) and 
recreates a natural musical scene, with harmonious placement of 
instruments and voices in the space in front of passengers, level with
the windscreen.

   QUESTION   

ANSWER

   SOLUTION   

 The route calculation is 
not successful. 

The guidance criteria may conﬂ ict with the current location (exclusion of 
toll roads on a toll motorway). 

 Check the guidance criteria on the Navigation 
Menu, "Guidance options"\ "Deﬁ ne calculation 
criteria". 

 The POIs do not appear. 

The POIs have not been selected.

 Select the POIs in the list of POIs. 

The POIs have not been downloaded. 

 The risk areas audible
warning does not work. 

The audible warning is not active. 

 The system does not
suggest a detour around 
an incident on the route. 

The guidance criteria do not take account of TMC messages. 

 Download the POIs from the website:   
"http://peugeot.navigation.com".

 Activate audible warnings in the Guidance options 
menu, "Navigation - guidance", "Set parameters 
for risk areas".

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

   QUESTION   
 Certain trafﬁ c jams
along the route are not
indicated in real time.

ANSWER

   SOLUTION   

On starting, it is several minutes before the system begins to receive the
trafﬁ c information.

 Wait until the trafﬁ c information is being received 
correctly (display of the trafﬁ c information icons on
the map). 

The ﬁ lters are too restrictive.

 Modify the "Geographic ﬁ lter" settings. 

In certain countries, only major routes (motorways...) are listed for the
trafﬁ c information.

 This phenomenon is normal. The system is
dependent on the trafﬁ c information available.

 The altitude is not 
displayed. 

On starting, the initialisation of the GPS may take up to 3 minutes to
receive more than 4 satellites correctly.

Depending on the geographical environment (tunnel...) or the weather, 
the conditions of reception of the GPS signal may vary. 

 I cannot connect my
Bluetooth telephone.

The telephone's Bluetooth function may be switched off or the telephone
may not be visible.

 Wait until the system has started up completely. 
Check that there is a GPS coverage of at least
4 satellites (long press on the SETUP button, 
then select "GPS coverage"). 

 This phenomenon is normal. The system
is dependent on the GPS signal reception
conditions. 

  -   Check that your telephone's Bluetooth

function is switched on. 

  -   Check in the telephone settings that it is 

"visible to all".

 The volume of the
telephone connected
in Bluetooth mode is
inaudible. 

The Bluetooth telephone is not compatible with the system. 

The volume depends both on the system and on the telephone.

 A list of compatible Bluetooth mobile telephones is 
available from the dealer network.

 Increase the volume of the audio system, to
maximum if required, and increase the volume of 
the telephone if necessary.

The ambient noise level has an inﬂ uence on the quality of telephone 
communication. 

 Reduce the ambient noise level (close the windows,
reduce the booster fan speed, slow down, ...). 

269

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

   QUESTION   
 Some contacts are
duplicated in the list.

ANSWER

   SOLUTION   

The options for synchronizing contacts are synchronizing the contacts 
on the SIM card, the contacts on the telephone, or both. When both 
synchronizations are selected, some contacts may be duplicated.

 Select "Display SIM card contacts" or "Display
telephone contacts". 

 Contacts are not shown 
in alphabetical order.

Some telephones offer display options. Depending on the settings
chosen, contacts can be transferred in a speciﬁ c order.

 Modify the display setting in the telephone 
directory.

 The system does not
receive SMS text messages. 

The Bluetooth mode does not permit sending SMS text messages to the
system. 

 The CD is ejected 
automatically or is not 
played by the player. 

The CD is inserted upside down, is unplayable, does not contain any 
audio data or contains an audio format which the player cannot play. 

Le CD has been recorded in a format that is not compatible with the player.

The CD is protected by an anti-pirating protection system which is not 
recognised by the audio system. 

  -   Check that the CD is inserted in the player the 

right way up.

  -   Check the condition of the CD: the CD cannot 

be played if it is too damaged. 

  -   Check the content in the case of a recorded

CD: refer to the advice in the "AUDIO"
section.
The audio system's CD player does not play DVDs. 

  -
  -   Some recorded CDs will not be played by 

the audio system because they are not of the
correct quality.  

 There is a long waiting 
period following the insertion 
of a CD or connection of a
USB memory stick.
 The CD player sound is
poor.

270

When a new medium is inserted, the system reads a certain amount of 
data (directory, title, artist, etc.). This may take from a few seconds to a
few minutes.

 This phenomenon is normal. 

The CD used is scratched or of poor quality.

The audio equipment settings (bass, treble, ambiences) are unsuitable.

 Insert good quality CDs and store them in suitable 
conditions. 

 Set the treble or bass level to 0, without selecting
an ambience. 

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

   QUESTION   

 Some characters in the
media information are not 
displayed correctly while 
playing. 

 Playing of streaming ﬁ les
does not start. 

 The names of tracks and 
the track length are not
displayed on the screen
when streaming audio. 

 The quality of reception
of the radio station 
listened to gradually
deteriorates or the stored 
stations do not function
(no sound, 87.5 Mhz is 
displayed...). 

 I cannot ﬁ nd some radio
stations in the list of 
stations received.

 The name of the radio 
station changes. 

The audio system does not display some types of characters.

ANSWER

   SOLUTION   

 Use standard characters to name tracks and
folders. 

The peripheral device connected does not support automatic play.

 Start the playback from the device. 

The Bluetooth proﬁ le does not allow the transfer of this information. 

The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station listened
to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area through which the 
vehicle is travelling. 

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, basement car parks...) block 
reception, including in RDS mode.
The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going
through a car wash or into an underground car park). 

The station is not received or its name has changed in the list. 

Some radio stations send other information in place of their name 
(the title of the song for example).
The system interprets this information as the name of the station. 

 Activate the "RDS" function by means of the
short-cut menu to enable the system to check 
whether there is a more powerful transmitter in the
geographical area.

 This phenomenon is normal and does not indicate 
a fault with the audio system. 
 Have the aerial checked by a PEUGEOT dealer. 

271

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

ANSWER

   SOLUTION   

The selection of an equalizer setting imposes the balance settings.
Modifying one without the other is not possible. 

 Modify the balance or equalizer settings to obtain
the desired musical ambience.

The selection of a distribution setting imposes the balance settings.
Modifying one without the other is not possible. 

 Modify the balance or distribution settings to 
obtain the desired musical ambience. 

   QUESTION   

 In changing the setting
of treble and bass the
equalizer setting is
deselected. 

 In changing the equalizer 
setting, treble and bass
return to zero. 

 When changing the 
balance settings, the 
distribution setting is 
deselected. 

 When changing an 
distribution setting, 
the balance setting is
deselected. 

 There is a difference in 
sound quality between
the different audio
sources (radio, CD...). 

For optimum sound quality, the audio settings for Volume, Bass, Treble,
Equalizer and Loudness can be adapted to the different sound sources,
which may result in audible differences when changing source (radio,
CD...). 

 Check that the audio settings for (Volume, Bass,
Treble, Equalizer, Loudness) are adapted to
the sources listened to. It is advisable to set the
AUDIO functions (Bass, Treble, Fr-Re balance,
Le-Ri balance) to the middle position, select the 
"None", musical ambience and set the loudness 
correction to the "Active" position in CD mode or 
to the "Inactive" position in radio mode. 

272

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

   QUESTION   

 With the engine off, the 
system switches off after 
a few minutes of use.

 Playback of my USB 
memory stick starts only 
after a very long wait 
(around 2 to 3 minutes).

 When I connect my
iPhone as telephone and 
to the USB port at the
same time, I am unable 
to play the music ﬁ les. 

ANSWER

   SOLUTION   

When the engine is switched off, the system's operating time depends on 
the battery charge. 
The switch-off is normal: the system switches to economy mode and 
switches off to prevent discharging of the vehicle's battery. 

 Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery
charge. 

Some ﬁ les supplied with the memory stick may greatly slow down access 
to reading the memory stick (multiplication by 10 of the catalogue time).

 Delete the ﬁ les supplied with the memory stick
and limit the number of sub-folders in the ﬁ le 
structure on the memory stick. 

When the iPhone connects automatically as a telephone, it forces the 
streaming function. The streaming function takes the place of the USB
function which is then not useable, there is a period without sound of the 
track being played with Apple®  players.

®

 Disconnect and reconnect to the USB port
(the USB function takes priority over streaming).

273

274

  For safety reasons, the driver must only carry out
operations which require prolonged attention while the 
vehicle is stationary. 
 When the engine is switched off and to prevent 
discharging of the battery, the system switches off after 
activation of energy economy mode.

  INFORMATION AND ADVICE

  The audio system will only play ﬁ les with ".mp3", ".wma" and ".wav"
on a CD and can play ﬁ les with ".ogg" extension only on USB. 

On a single disc, the CD player can read up to 255 MP3 ﬁ les spread
over 8 folder levels with a maximum of 192 folders. However, it is 
recommended that this be kept to 2 levels so as to limit the time taken
to access and play the CD.
During play, the folder structure is not observed.  

  A high compression rate can adversely affect sound quality.  

In order to be able to play a recorded CDR or CDRW, when recording
it is preferable to select standards ISO 9660 level 1.2 or Joliet.
If the disc is recorded in another format, it may not be played correctly.
It is recommended that the same recording standard is always used
for an individual disc, with as low a speed as possible (4x maximum)
for optimum sound quality.
In the particular case of a multi-session CD, the Joliet standard is 
recommended.

  The playlists accepted on CD, MP3, iPod and USB connection are 
types ".m3u" and ".wpl".
 The number of ﬁ les recognised is limited to 5 000 in 500 folders on a 
maximum of 8 levels.

Do not connect a hard disk or USB device other than audio players to 
the USB port. This may cause damage to your installation.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

The following tables contain answers to the most frequently asked questions.  

QUESTION

ANSWER

SOLUTION

 There is a difference in 
sound quality between
the different audio
sources (radio, CD...). 

For optimum sound quality, the audio settings (volume, bass, treble, 
ambience, loudness) can be adapted to the different sound sources, 
which may result in audible differences when changing source (radio,
CD...). 

 Check that the audio settings (volume, bass, 
treble, ambience, loudness) are adapted to the
sources listened to. It is advisable to adjust audio 
settings (bass, treble, Front-Rear balance, Left-
Right balance) to the middle position, select the 
musical ambience and set the loudness correction
to the "Active" position in CD mode or to the 
"Inactive" position in radio mode. 

Choosing an ambience imposes settings for treble and bass. Modifying
one without the other is only possible with a personalised ambience.

 Modify the treble and bass settings or the
ambience setting to obtain the desired sound 
quality.

Choosing the "driver" distribution setting imposes a balance setting. 

 Modify the balance setting or the distribution 
setting to obtain the desired sound quality.

 When changing the 
settings for treble and
bass, the ambience 
setting is deselected.
 When changing the 
ambience setting, treble 
and bass are reset to 
zero.

 When changing the 
balance setting, 
distribution is deselected.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

QUESTION

 The quality of reception
of the radio station 
listened to gradually
deteriorates or the stored 
stations do not function
(no sound, 87.5 MHz is
displayed...). 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

The vehicle is too far from the transmitter used by the station listened
to or there is no transmitter in the geographical area through which the 
vehicle is travelling. 

 Activate the RDS function to enable the system 
to check whether there is a more powerful 
transmitter in the geographical area.

The environment (hills, buildings, tunnels, basement car parks...) block 
reception, including in RDS mode.

 This phenomenon is normal and does not indicate 
a failure of the audio equipment.

The aerial is absent or has been damaged (for example when going
through a car wash or into an underground car park). 

 Have the aerial checked by a PEUGEOT dealer. 

 Sound cut-outs of 1 to
2 seconds in radio mode.

During this brief sound cut-out, the RDS searches for any frequency 
permitting better reception of the station. 

 Deactivate the RDS function if the phenomenon is 
too frequent and always on the same route.

 Trafﬁ c announcement
TA is displayed. I do
not receive any trafﬁ c 
information.

 The stored stations are
not found (no sound, 
87.5 MHz is displayed...).

The radio station does not broadcast trafﬁ c information. 

 Tune to a radio station which broadcasts trafﬁ c 
information.

 An incorrect waveband is selected.

 Press the SRC/TEL button to return to the
waveband (FM1 or FM2) on which the stations 
are stored.

audio data or contains an audio format which the player cannot play. 
The CD is protected by an anti-pirating protection system which is not 
recognised by the audio equipment. 

  -   Check that the CD is inserted in the player the 

right way up.

  -   Check the condition of the CD: the CD cannot 

be played if it is too damaged. 

  -   Check the content in the case of a recorded
CD: consult the advice in the "Audio" section.
The audio equipment's CD player does not
play DVDs.

  -  

  -   Due to their quality level, certain writeable

CDs will not be played by the audio system.

 The CD player sound is
poor.

The CD used is scratched or of poor quality.

The audio settings (bass, treble, ambience) are unsuitable. 

 Insert good quality CDs and store them in suitable 
conditions. 

 Set the treble or bass level to 0, without selecting
an ambience. 

The battery of the peripheral may not be sufﬁ ciently charged.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

QUESTION

 An iPod is not recognised
when connecting to the 
USB port.

 The hard disk or device
is not recognised when
connecting to the USB
port. 

 When streaming, the 
sound cuts momentarily. 

 In "Random all" play,
not all of the tracks are
played.

The iPod is of a generation that is not compatible with the USB. 

ANSWER

SOLUTION

Some hard disks and devices need a power supply greater than is
provided by the audio system. 

Some telephones prioritise connection of the "hands-free" proﬁ le.

In "Random all" play, the system can only take into account up to 999 tracks.

 Connect the device to the 230 V socket, the 12 V 
socket or an external power supply. 
Caution : ensure that the device does not transmit 
a voltage greater than 5 V (risk of destruction of 
the system). 

 Delete the "hands-free" connection proﬁ le to
improve streaming.

 With the engine off, the 
audio system switches 
off after a few minutes 
of use. 

When the engine is switched off, the audio system operating time
depends on the battery charge. 
The switch-off is normal: the audio system switches to economy mode 
and switches off to prevent discharging the vehicle's battery. 

 Start the vehicle's engine to increase the battery
charge. 

 The message "the audio 
system is overheated" 
appears on the display. 

In order to protect the installation if the surrounding temperature is too
high, the audio system switches to an automatic thermal protection mode 
leading to a reduction of the volume or stopping of the playing of the CD. 

 Switch the audio system off for a few minutes to
allow the system to cool.

299

300

  For safety reasons, the driver must only carry out
operations which require prolonged attention while the 
vehicle is stationary. 
 When the engine is switched off and to prevent 
discharging of the battery, the system switches off after 
activation of economy mode.

  CD 

  INFORMATION AND ADVICE

  The audio system can only play ﬁ les with ".mp3", ".wma" or ".wav"
extensions.  

On a given disc, the CD player can read up to 255 MP3 ﬁ les spread
over 8 levels. However, it is advisable to keep to a limit of two levels to
reduce the access time before the CD is played. 
The folder structure is not observed during playback.  

  A high compression level can degrade the sound quality.  

  It is advisable to restrict ﬁ le names to 20 characters without using
special characters (e.g. " ? ; ù) to avoid any playing or displaying 
problems.  

In order to be able to play a recorded CDR or CDRW, when recording
it is preferable to select standards ISO 9660 level 1.2 or Joliet.
If the disc is recorded in another format, it may not be played correctly.
It is recommended that the same recording standard is always used
for a given disc, with as low a speed as possible (4x maximum) for 
optimum sound quality.
In the particular case of a multi-session CD, the Joliet standard is 
recommended.

  Playlists accepted are types .m3u and .pls.
 The system can recognise up to 5 000 ﬁ les in 500 folders on 8 levels.
