Airbag deactivation 3 46.
Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This makes sure that the
child's backbone, which is still very
weak, is under less strain in the event
of an accident.
Suitable are restraint systems that
comply with ECE 44-03 or
ECE 44-04. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.

■ Do not place any objects on the
load compartment cover or the
instrument panel.

■ The load must not obstruct the
operation of the pedals, parking
brake and gear selector, or hinder
the freedom of movement of the
driver. Do not place any unsecured
objects in the interior.

■ Do not drive with an open load
compartment. In addition, the
number plate is only
distinguishable and illuminated
correctly if the doors are closed.

■ The payload is the difference
between the permitted gross
vehicle weight (see identification
plate 3 150) and the EC kerb
weight.
To calculate the EC kerb weight,
enter the data for your vehicle in the
Weights table at the front of this
manual.
The EC kerb weight includes
weights for the driver (68 kg),
luggage (7 kg) and all fluids (tank
90 % full).
Optional equipment and
accessories increase the kerb
weight.

■ Driving with a roof load increases

the sensitivity of the vehicle to
cross-winds and has a detrimental
effect on vehicle handling due to
the vehicle’s higher centre of
gravity. Distribute the load evenly
and secure it properly with retaining
straps. Adjust the tyre pressure and
vehicle speed according to the load
conditions. Check and retighten the
straps frequently.
Do not drive faster than 120 km/h.

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving without
any notification. The filter is cleaned
by periodically burning off the soot
particles at high temperature. This

Driving and operating

95

process takes place automatically
and the emission of smells and
smoke during this process is normal.
If cleaning of the filter is required and
automatic cleaning does not occur, it
will be indicated by the illumination of
control indicator A and 8 in the
instrument cluster. Seek the
assistance of a workshop
immediately.

Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the
amount of harmful substances in the
exhaust gases.

Caution

Fuel grades other than those listed
on pages 3 109, 3 152 could
damage the catalytic converter or
electronic components.

first gear is engaged and the clutch is
released when the vehicle is stopped.
In R, reverse gear remains engaged.
When stopping on gradients, engage
parking brake or depress the foot
brake. To prevent overheating of the
clutch, an intermittent audible

warning may sound as a signal to
depress the foot brake or apply the
parking brake.
Switch off engine if stopping for a
lengthy period, e.g. in traffic jams.
When the vehicle is parked and the
driver's door is opened, a warning
chime will sound if neutral is not
selected or the foot brake has not
been depressed.
Engine braking
Automatic mode
When driving downhill, the manual
transmission automated does not
shift into higher gears until a fairly
high engine speed has been reached.
It shifts down in good time when
braking.
Manual mode
To utilise the engine braking effect,
select a lower gear in good time when
driving downhill.

Rocking the vehicle
Rocking the vehicle is only
permissible if the vehicle is stuck in
sand, mud, snow or a hole. Move the
selector lever between R and A/M (or
between + and -) in a repeat pattern,
while applying light pressure to the
accelerator pedal. Do not race the
engine and avoid sudden
acceleration.
Parking
Apply the parking brake. The most
recently engaged gear (see
transmission display) remains
engaged. With N, no gear is engaged.
When the ignition is switched off, the
transmission no longer responds to
movement of the selector lever.

Manual mode
If a higher gear is selected when the
engine speed is too low, or a lower
gear when the speed is too high, the
shift is not executed. This prevents
the engine from running at too low or
too high an engine speed.

If engine speed is too low, the
transmission automatically shifts to a
lower gear.
If engine speed is too high, the
transmission only switches to a higher
gear via kickdown.

transmission switches to a higher
gear, even in manual mode. Without
kickdown this automatic shift is not
effected in manual mode.

Fault
In the event of a fault, W is shown in
the transmission display. Continued
driving is possible provided the
vehicle is driven with care and
anticipation.
Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

Interruption of power
supply
The clutch is not disengaged if there
is an interruption of the power supply
when a gear is engaged. The vehicle
cannot move.
If the battery is discharged, start the
vehicle using jump leads 3 137.
If the cause of the fault is not a
discharged battery, seek the
assistance of a workshop.
If neutral cannot be selected, the
vehicle must only be towed with the
drive wheels raised off the ground.
Towing the vehicle 3 140.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when you depress the
brake pedal firmly. You need to use
considerably more force for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing your journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
If control indicator R illuminates in
the instrument cluster while driving
and the message BRAKING FAULT
appears in the Driver Information
Centre there is a fault in the braking
system. Seek the assistance of a
workshop immediately.

Control indicator R 3 71.
Vehicle messages 3 75.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.
ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
Control indicator u 3 72.
Fault
If control indicator u does not go out
a few seconds after the ignition is
switched on, or if it illuminates while
driving, there is a fault in the ABS.
Control indicator A may also

illuminate in the instrument cluster
together with the messages CHECK
ABS and CHECK ESP in the Driver
Information Centre. The brake
system remains operational but
without ABS regulation.

9 Warning

If there is a fault in the ABS, the
wheels may be liable to lock due
to braking that is heavier than
normal. The advantages of ABS
are no longer available. During
hard braking, the vehicle can no
longer be steered and may
swerve.

If control indicators u, A, R and
C illuminate, the ABS and ESP are
deactivated and the message
BRAKING FAULT is shown in the
Driver Information Centre. Seek the
assistance of a workshop.

driving at approx. 2/3. Cold starts and
acceleration phases are also taken
into consideration.
The specification of CO2 emission is
also a constituent of the directive.
Fuel consumption is dependent on
personal driving style as well as road
and traffic conditions.
The calculation of fuel consumption
takes into account the vehicle's kerb
weight, ascertained in accordance
with the regulations. Optional
equipment may result in slightly
higher fuel consumption and CO2
emission levels and a lower maximum
speed.

■ Reposition left front seat to access

the release cover.

■ Remove the release cover and

position the seat belt to one side.
■ Raise fuel filler release to unlock

the fuel filler flap.

To open

To close
■ Close the fuel filler flap and lower

fuel filler release to lock the fuel
filler flap.

■ Replace the release cover.
■ Reposition left front seat.
If the cause of the interruption to the
power supply is not a discharged
battery, consult a workshop.

Fuel consumption - CO2-
Emissions
The determination of fuel
consumption is regulated by
European directive

Driving and operating

Towing
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.
Installation dimensions of factory-
fitted towing equipment 3 161.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
In the case of trailers with brakes,
attach the breakaway stopping cable.
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements. For trailers with
low driving stability the use of a
stabiliser is recommended.

A maximum speed of 80 km/h must
not be exceeded, even in countries
where higher speeds are permitted.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 160.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.

The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12 %.
The permitted trailer load applies up
to the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10 %
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8 %, e.g. motorways).
The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 150.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.

Driving and operating

113

9 Warning

Towing a trailer is permitted only
when a coupling ball bar is fitted
correctly. If the coupling ball bar
does not engage correctly, seek
the assistance of a workshop.

Towing equipment audible
warning
For vehicles fitted with towing
equipment, when connected to a
trailer the pitch of the audible warning
changes upon operation of the turn
signals.
The pitch of the audible warning will
also change if a turn signal light on the
trailer or the towing vehicle fails.

The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load is specified on the
towing equipment identification plate
and in the vehicle documents. Always
aim for the maximum load, especially
in the case of heavy trailers. The
vertical coupling load should never
fall below 25 kg.
In the case of trailer loads of
1200 kg or more, the vertical coupling
load should not be less than 50 kg.
Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded (including
all occupants), the permissible rear
axle load (see identification plate or
vehicle documents) must not be
exceeded.

Caution

When operating without a trailer,
remove the coupling ball bar.

Wheels and tyres

Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.

Tyres
Factory-fitted tyres are matched to
the chassis and offer optimum driving
comfort and safety.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.

In accordance with country-specific
regulations, a notice indicating the
maximum permissible speed for the
tyres must be affixed within the
driver's field of vision.

Tyre designations
E.g. 195/65 R 16 C 88 Q
195 = Tyre width, mm
65

= Cross-section ratio (tyre
height to tyre width), %

= Belt type: Radial

R
RF = Type: RunFlat
16
C
88

= Wheel diameter, inches
= Cargo or commercial use
= Load index e.g. 88 is

Q = up to 160 km/h
S = up to 180 km/h
T = up to 190 km/h
H = up to 210 km/h
V = up to 240 km/h
W = up to 270 km/h

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel.
Tyre pressures 3 160.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.
Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.

Vehicle care

131

Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.

Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons it is recommended
that the tread depth of the tyres on
one axle should not vary by more than
2 mm.

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear
indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.

If there is more wear at the front than
the rear, swap round front wheels and
rear wheels. Ensure that the direction
of rotation of the wheels is the same
as before.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every 6 years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and make other vehicle
modifications.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheels
may lead to accidents and will
invalidate the vehicle type
approval.

132

Vehicle care

Tyre chains

Tyre chains are only permitted on the
front wheels.
Always use fine mesh chains that add
no more than 15 mm to the tyre tread
and the inboard sides (including chain
lock).
For tyre size 215/65 R16, consult a
workshop.

9 Warning

Damage may lead to tyre blowout.

9 Warning

Do not drive faster than 80 km/h.
Do not use for a lengthy period.
Steering and handling may be
affected.

If the vehicle has a flat tyre:
Apply the parking brake and engage
first gear or reverse gear.
The tyre repair kit is located under the
front seat.

Wheel covers on steel wheels may
come into contact with parts of the
chains. In such cases, remove the
wheel covers.
Tyre chains may only be used at
speeds up to 50 km/h and, when
travelling on roads that are free of
snow, they may only be used for brief
periods since they are subject to rapid
wear on a hard road and may snap.

Tyre repair kit
Minor damage to the tyre tread or
sidewall can be repaired with the tyre
repair kit.
Do not remove foreign bodies from
the tyres.
Tyre damage exceeding 4 mm or that
is at tyre sidewall near the rim cannot
be repaired with the tyre repair kit.

If unusual noise is heard or the
compressor becomes hot, turn
compressor off for at least 30
minutes.
The built-in safety valve opens at a
pressure of 7 bar.
Note the expiry date of the kit. After
this date its sealing capability is no
longer guaranteed. Pay attention to
storage information on sealant
bottle.

Replace the used sealant bottle.
Dispose of the bottle as prescribed
by applicable laws.
The compressor and sealant can be
used from approx. -30 °C.
The adapters supplied can be used
to pump up other items e.g.
footballs, air mattresses, inflatable
dinghies etc. They are located on the
underside of the compressor. To
remove, screw on compressor air
hose and withdraw adapter.
Wheel changing
Some vehicles are equipped with a
tyre repair kit instead of a spare wheel
3 132.
Make the following preparations and
observe the following information:
■ Park the vehicle on a level, firm and

non-slippery surface. The front
wheels must be in the straight-
ahead position.

■ Apply the parking brake and

engage first gear or reverse gear.
■ Remove the spare wheel 3 136.

136

Vehicle care

Put wheel bolts somewhere
where the threads will not be
soiled.

2. Loosen each of the wheel bolts by

half a turn using the ratchet and
adapter. The ratchet should turn
anticlockwise to loosen the bolts.
Invert the ratchet if necessary.

3. Raise vehicle by placing lifting
pad spigot of the jack under the
jacking hole located nearest the
wheel concerned.
Ensure the jack is positioned
correctly. The jack base must be
on the ground directly below the
jacking hole in a manner that
prevents it from slipping.

4. Install adapter onto the jack and
raise the vehicle by turning the
ratchet until the wheel is clear of
the ground.

5. Unscrew wheel bolts completely
by turning anticlockwise and wipe
clean with a cloth.

6. Change the wheel.
7. Screw in the wheel bolts.
8. Lower vehicle.
9. Tighten each wheel bolt in a

crosswise sequence. Tightening
torque is 140 Nm.
10. Refit wheel cover
11. Change the wheel.
12. Stow the replaced wheel 3 136

and the vehicle tools 3 129.

13. Have the new wheel balanced on

the vehicle. Check the tyre
pressure of the installed tyre
3 160 and also the wheel bolt
torque as soon as possible.

Have the defective tyre renewed or
repaired.

Spare wheel
Some vehicles are equipped with a
tyre repair kit instead of a spare wheel
3 132.

Use of a spare wheel that is smaller
than the other wheels or together with
winter tyres could affect driveability.
Have the defective tyre replaced as
soon as possible.

The spare wheel is mounted under
the rear underbody and may be
secured using a security bolt that can
only be removed using the tool
supplied.

9 Warning

Due to the weight of the tyre
assembly, exercise caution when
releasing the spare wheel carrier.
Do not fully remove bolt 1.
Support the spare wheel with a
suitable object to prevent the
wheel falling suddenly when
loosening the carrier bolts - risk of
injury!

It may be necessary to jack the
vehicle up to gain access to the spare
wheel on a fully loaded vehicle with a
flat rear tyre.
To release the spare wheel carrier,
loosen bolt 1, ensuring it is not fully
removed. Fully remove bolt 2, then
pull the carrier to the left, until it clears
bolt 1, and lower the carrier assembly.
When installing the wheel ensure that
the spare wheel carrier is correctly
positioned before tightening the bolts.

Vehicle care

137

Summer and winter tyres
If you use winter tyres, the spare
wheel may still be fitted with a
summer tyre.
If you use the spare wheel when it is
fitted with a summer tyre the vehicle's
driveability may be affected,
especially on slippery road surfaces.
Directional tyres
Fit directional tyres such that they roll
in the direction of travel. The rolling
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.
The following applies to tyres fitted
opposing the rolling direction:
■ Driveability may be affected. Have

the defective tyre renewed or
repaired as soon as possible.

■ Do not drive faster than 80 km/h.
■ Drive particularly carefully on wet
and snow-covered road surfaces.

Jump starting
Do not start with a quick charger.

138

Vehicle care

A vehicle with a discharged battery
can be started using jump leads and
the battery of another vehicle.

9 Warning

Be extremely careful when starting
with jump leads. Any deviation
from the following instructions can
lead to injuries or damage caused
by battery explosion or damage to
the electrical systems of both
vehicles.

9 Warning

Avoid contact with eyes, skin,
fabrics, and painted surfaces. The
fluid contains sulphuric acid which
can cause injuries and damage in
the event of direct contact.

■ Never expose the battery to naked

flames or sparks.

■ A discharged battery can already
freeze at a temperature of 0 °C.
Defrost the frozen battery before
connecting jump leads.

■ Wear eye protection and protective

clothing when handling a battery.

Battery access

■ Use a booster battery with the

same voltage (12 volts). Its capacity
(Ah) must not be much less than
that of the discharged battery.
■ Use jump leads with insulated

terminals and a cross section of at
least 16 mm2 (25 mm2 for diesel
engines).

■ Do not disconnect the discharged

battery from the vehicle.

■ Switch off all unnecessary electrical

consumers.

■ Do not lean over the battery during

jump starting.

■ Do not allow the terminals of one

lead to touch those of the other
lead.

■ The vehicles must not come into
contact with each other during the
jump starting process.

■ Apply the parking brake,
transmission in neutral.

The battery is located beneath the
front left hand seat floor panel. Lift the
floor covering and use the tool
supplied in the tool kit (or the tyre
repair kit) to loosen the 4 screws.
Note the position of the arrow facing
forwards on the battery cover when
replacing.

Vehicle care

139

2. After 5 minutes, start the other

engine. Start attempts should be
made for no longer than
15 seconds at an interval of
1 minute.

3. Allow both engines to idle for

approx. 3 minutes with the leads
connected.

4. Switch on electrical consumers

(e.g. headlights, heated rear
window) of the vehicle receiving
the jump start.

5. Reverse above sequence exactly

when removing leads.

Lead connection order:
1. Connect the red lead to the

positive terminal of the booster
battery.

2. Connect the other end of the red
lead to the positive terminal of the
discharged battery.

3. Connect the black lead to the

negative terminal of the booster
battery.

4. Connect the other end of the black
lead to a vehicle grounding point,
such as the engine block or an
engine mounting bolt. Connect as
far away from the discharged
battery as possible, however at
least 60 cm.

Route the leads so that they cannot
catch on rotating parts in the engine
compartment.
To start the engine:
1. Start the engine of the vehicle

providing the jump start.

Remove cover plate to access the
battery.

Towing
Towing the vehicle

The towing eye is stowed with the
vehicle tools 3 129.
Screw the towing eye fully into the
front towing point.
Attach a tow rope - or better still a tow
rod - to the towing eye, never to the
bumper or front suspension units.

Caution

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

When the engine is not running,
considerably more force is needed to
brake and steer.
To prevent the entry of exhaust fumes
from the towing vehicle, switch on the
air recirculation system and close the
windows.
Seek the assistance of a workshop.
After towing, unscrew the towing eye.

Do not tow the vehicle from the
rear. The front towing eye must
only be used for towing and not
recovering a vehicle.

Caution

Activate the child locks in the rear
doors if the rear seats are
occupied. Child locks 3 25.

Switch on ignition to release steering
wheel lock and to permit operation of
brake lights, horn and windscreen
wipers.
Transmission in neutral.
If neutral cannot be selected on
vehicles with manual transmission
automated, the vehicle must only be
towed with the drive wheels raised off
the ground.

Towing another vehicle

The fixed towing eye is located under
the rear bumper.

Vehicles with a towing hitch have a
socket for the detachable towing eye.
Screw the towing eye, supplied with
the vehicle tools, fully into the socket.
Attach a tow rope - or better still a tow
rod - to the rear towing eye, never to
the rear axle and suspension units.
The rear towing eye must only be
used for towing and not recovering a
vehicle.

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

Vehicle care

141

Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use de-icing agent only when
absolutely necessary, as this has a
degreasing effect and impairs lock
function. After using de-icing agent,
have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select a programme that
includes waxing.
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.

142

Vehicle care

If using a vehicle wash, comply with
the vehicle wash manufacturer's
instructions. The windscreen wipers
and rear window wiper must be
switched off. Remove antenna and
external accessories such as roof
racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of 4 to 9.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.
Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Plastic body parts must not be treated
with wax or polishing agents.

Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window,
make sure the heating element inside
is not damaged.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with a
soft cloth and window cleaner.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.

Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Engine compartment
It is advisable to wash the engine
compartment before and after winter
and preserve it with wax. Protect the

alternator and brake fluid reservoir
with plastic sheets before washing
the engine.
When washing the engine with a
steam-jet cleaner, do not direct the
steam jet towards components of the
antilock brake system, air
conditioning system or the belt drive
and its components.
After an engine wash, have all engine
compartment components preserved
thoroughly by a workshop using
protective wax.
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.

Vehicle care

143

The instrument panel should only be
cleaned using a soft damp cloth.
Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-
coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, like zips or
belts or studded jeans.

144

Vehicle care

Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

Only use products that meet the
recommended specifications.
Damage resulting from the use of
products not in line with these
specifications will not be covered by
the warranty.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil

aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
petrol and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities have to be used.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 151.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 151.

Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 151.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only silicate-free long life coolant
(LLC) antifreeze approved for the
vehicle, consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost

148

Service and maintenance

protection down to approx. -28 °C.
This concentration should be
maintained all year round. The use of
additional coolant additives that
intend to give additional corrosion
protection or seal against minor leaks
can cause function problems. Liability
for consequences resulting from the
use of additional coolant additives will
be rejected.
Brake fluid
Only use DOT4 brake fluid approved
for the vehicle, consult a workshop.
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.
Brake fluid should be stored in a
sealed container to avoid water
absorption.
Ensure brake fluid does not become
contaminated.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
■ Operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels)

■ Status messages of the vehicle and
its single components (e.g. number
of wheel revolutions / rotational
speed, deceleration, lateral
acceleration)

■ Dysfunctions and defects in

important system components

■ Vehicle reactions in particular

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the stability
regulation system)

■ Environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature)

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimizing vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

Customer information

When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
