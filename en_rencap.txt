1.12

LOCKING, UNLOCKING THE DOORS (1/2)
Locking/Unlocking the doors 
from the outside
This is done using the RENAULT Card; 
see the “RENAULT Card” information in 
Section 1.
In certain cases, the RENAULT card 
may not work:
–  if the RENAULT card battery is weak, 

flat, etc.

2

1

–  if equipment operating on the same 
frequency  as  the  card  (mobile 
phones, etc.) is used;

–  vehicle located in a high electromag-

netic radiation zone.

It is then possible:
–  to  use  the  key  integrated  into  the 
card  to  unlock  the  front  left-hand 
door;

–  to lock each of the doors manually;
–  to  use  the  interior  door  locking/un-
locking control (refer to the following 
pages).

Using the key integrated in 
the RENAULT card
Insert key 1 into the lock in the driver’s 
door and lock or unlock.

Locking the doors manually
Turn screw 2 with the door open (using 
the end of the key) and close the door.
This  means  that  the  doors  are  then 
locked from the outside.
The  doors  may  then  only  be  opened 
from the inside or by using the key in 
the front left-hand door.

1.13

LOCKING, UNLOCKING THE DOORS (2/2)

3

Interior locking/unlocking 
door control
Switch 3 controls the doors, boot and, 
depending on the vehicle, the fuel filler 
flap simultaneously.
If a door or the tailgate is open or not 
closed properly, the doors and tailgate 
lock/unlock quickly.
If you need to transport objects with the 
boot open, the other opening elements 
can  still  be  locked:  with  the  engine 
stopped,  press switch 3 for more than 
five seconds to lock the other opening 
elements.

1.14

Locking the doors without 
the RENAULT card
For  example,  in  the  event  of  a  dis-
charged battery or the RENAULT card 
temporarily not working, etc.
With  the  engine  switched  off  and 
an  opening  element  (door  or  boot) 
open, press and hold switch 3 for more 
than five seconds.
When the door is closed, all the doors 
and the tailgate will be locked.
Unlocking the vehicle from the outside 
is only possible with the RENAULT card 
in the vehicle's access zone or using 
the  key  integrated  in  the  RENAULT 
card.

Door and tailgate status 
indicator
With the ignition on, the warning light 
integrated in switch 3 informs you of the 
locking status of the opening elements:
–  indicator light on, the doors and tail-

gate are locked,

–  indicator light off, the doors and tail-

gate are unlocked.

When you lock the doors, the indicator 
light remains lit and then goes out.

After  locking/unlocking  the  vehicle 
or  the  luggage  compartment  only 
using the buttons on the RENAULT 
card, remote locking and unlocking 
in hands-free mode are deactivated.
To reactivate the “hands-free” mode: 
restart the vehicle.

Never  leave  your  vehicle 
with  the  RENAULT  card 
inside.

Driver’s responsibility
If  you  decide  to  keep  the 
doors locked when you are 
driving,  remember  that  it 
may be more difficult for those as-
sisting  you  to  gain  access  to  the 
passenger  compartment  in  the 
event of an emergency.

RENAULT ANTI-INTRUDER DEVICE (RAID)

Activating/deactivating the 
function
With  the  engine  running,  press  the 
button 1 for approximately 5 seconds, 
until you hear a warning beep.

Operating faults
If  you  experience  an  operating  fault 
(no  automatic  locking,  the  indicator 
light incorporated in button 1 does not 
light up when trying to lock the open-
ing elements, etc.), firstly check that the 
opening elements are properly closed. 
If they are properly closed, contact an 
authorised dealer.

1

Operating principle
After the vehicle is started, the system 
automatically  locks  the  doors  when 
you are driving at approximately 6 mph  
(10 km/h) and over.
The door can be unlocked:
–  by  pressing  the  button  1  to  unlock 

the doors;

–  by opening a front door (vehicle sta-

tionary).

NB: if a door is opened or closed, it will 
automatically lock again when the vehi-
cle reaches a speed of 6 mph (10 km/h).

Driver’s responsibility
If  you  decide  to  keep  the 
doors locked when you are 
driving,  remember  that  it 
may be more difficult for those as-
sisting  you  to  gain  access  to  the 
passenger  compartment  in  the 
event of an emergency.

regulates the heating and deactivates it 
if necessary.

For  safety  reasons,  carry 
out any adjustments when 
the  vehicle  is  not  being 
driven.

Nothing  should  be  placed  on  the 
floor (area in front of driver) as such 
objects may slide under the pedal 
during  braking  manoeuvres,  thus 
obstructing its use.

We  would  advise  you  not 
to recline the seatbacks too 
far to ensure that the effec-
tiveness of the seat belts is 

not reduced.

SEAT BELTS (1/4)
Always wear your seat belt when trav-
elling  in  your  vehicle.  You  must  also 
comply with the legislation of the par-
ticular country you are in.

Before starting, first adjust your driv-
ing position, then ask all occupants 
to adjust their seat belts to ensure 
optimum protection.

Make sure that the rear bench seat 
is locked in position correctly so that 
the rear seat belts will operate effi-
ciently. Refer to the information on 
the “Rear bench seat: functions” in 
Section 3.

Incorrectly  adjusted  or 
twisted  seat  belts  may 
cause injuries in the event 
of an accident.

Use  one  seat  belt  per  person, 
whether child or adult.
Even pregnant women should wear 
a seat belt. In this case, ensure that 
the lap belt is not exerting too much 
pressure  on  the  abdomen,  but  do 
not allow any slack.

Adjusting your driving 
position
–  Sit well back in your seat (having 
first  removed  your  coat  or  jacket). 
This is essential to ensure your back 
is positioned correctly;

–  adjust  the  distance  between  the 
seat  and  the  pedals.  Your  seat 
should  be  as  far  back  as  possible 
while  still  allowing  you  to  depress 
the clutch pedal fully. The seatback 
should be adjusted so that your arms 
are slightly bent when you hold the 
steering wheel;

–  adjust the position of your head-
rest. For the maximum safety, your 
head must be as close as possible to 
the headrest;

–  adjust the height of the seat. This 
adjustment allows you to select the 
seat  position  which  offers  you  the 
best possible view;

–  adjust the position of the steering 

wheel.

Adjusting the seat belts
Sit  with  your  back  firmly  against  the 
seatback.
Shoulder strap 1 should be as close as 
possible to the base of the neck but not 
on it.
Lap belt 2 should be worn flat over the 
thighs and against the pelvis.
The  belt  should  be  worn  so  that  it  is 
as close as possible to your body, i.e.: 
avoid wearing heavy clothing or keep-
ing bulky objects under the belts, etc.

Locking
Unwind the belt slowly and smoothly 
and  ensure  that  buckle 3  locks  into 
catch 5 (check that it is locked by pull-
ing on buckle 3).
If the belt jams, allow it to return slightly 
before attempting to unwind it again.
If your seat belt is completely jammed, 
pull slowly, but firmly, so that just over 
3 cm unwinds. Allow it to return slightly 
before attempting to unwind it again.
If there is still a problem, contact an ap-
proved dealer.

SEAT BELTS (4/4)
The following information applies to the vehicle’s front and rear seat belts.

–  No modification may be made to the component parts of the originally fitted restraint system: seat belts, seats and 

their mountings. For special operations (e.g. fitting child seats), contact an authorised dealer.

– Do not use devices which allow any slack in the belts (e.g. clothes pegs, clips, etc.): a seat belt which is worn too 
loosely may cause injury in the event of an accident.

–  Never wear the shoulder strap under your arm or behind your back.
–  Never use the same belt for more than one person and never hold a baby or child on your lap with your seat belt around 

–  The belt should never be twisted.
–  Following an accident, have the seat belts checked and replaced if necessary. Always replace your seat belts as soon as

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS (1/4)
Depending on the vehicle, they will con-
sist of:
–  front seat belt inertia reel preten-

sioners;

–  chest-level load limiters;
–  air bags for driver and front pas-

senger.

These systems are designed to act in-
dependently or together when the vehi-
cle is subjected to a frontal impact.
Depending  on  the  severity  of  the 
impact, the system can trigger:
–  seat belt locking;
–  the seat belt inertia reel pretensioner 
(which engages to correct seat belt 
slack);

–  airbags.

1

Pretensioners
The  pretensioners  hold  the  seat  belt 
against the body, holding the occupant 
more securely against the seat, thus in-
creasing the seat belt’s efficiency.
With the ignition on, following a signif-
icant frontal impact and depending on 
the severity of the impact, the system 
may  trigger  the  seat  belt  inertia  reel 
pretensioner 1, which instantly retracts 
the seat belt.

–  Have  the  entire  restraint 
system checked following 
an accident.

– No  operation  whatso-
ever is permitted on any part of 
the  system  (pretensioners,  air 
bags, computers, wiring) and the 
system  components  must  not 
be reused on any other vehicle, 
even if identical.

–  To  avoid  incorrect  triggering  of 
the  system  which  may  cause 
injury,  only  qualified  personnel 
from  an  approved  Dealer  may 
work on the pretensioner and air 
bag system.

–  The electric trigger system may 
only  be  tested  by  a  specially 
trained  technician  using  special 
equipment.

–  When  the  vehicle  is  scrapped, 
contact  an  approved  Dealer  for 
disposal of the pretensioner and 
air bag gas generators.

1.23

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS (2/4)
Load limiter
Above a certain severity of impact, this 
mechanism is used to limit the force of 
the belt against the body so that it is at 
an acceptable level.

Airbags for driver and front 
passenger
Fitted to the driver and passenger side.
The presence of this equipment is in-
dicated  by  the  word  “Air  bag”  on  the 
steering wheel and dashboard (air bag 
zone A) and, depending on the vehicle, 
a  symbol  on  the  lower  section  of  the 
windscreen.
Each air bag system consists of:
–  an air bag and gas generator fitted 
on the steering wheel for the driver 
and  in  the  dashboard  for  the  front 
passenger;

A

–  an electronic unit for system monitor-
ing which controls the gas generator 
electrical trigger system;
–  a single å warning light on the 
instrument panel.

The  air  bag  system  uses 
pyrotechnic principles. This 
explains why, when the air 
bag  inflates,  it  will  gener-
ate heat, produce smoke (this does 
not mean that a fire is about to start) 
and make a noise upon detonation. 
In  a  situation  where  an  air  bag  is 
required,  it  will  inflate  immediately 
and this may cause some minor, su-
perficial grazing to the skin or other 
problems.

1.24

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS (3/4)

Operating faults
Warning light å will light up on the 
in- strument panel when the ignition is  
turned on and then go out after a few  
seconds.
If it does not light up when the ignition 
is switched on, or comes on when the 
engine is running, there is a fault in the 
system.
Contact your approved Dealer as soon 
as possible. Your protection will be re-
duced until this fault is rectified.

Operation
This system is only operational when 
the ignition is switched on.
In a severe frontal impact, the airbags 
inflate  rapidly,  cushioning  the  impact 
of the driver's head and chest against 
the steering wheel and of the front pas-
senger against the dashboard. The air-
bags then deflate immediately so that 
the passengers are not in any way hin-
dered from leaving the vehicle.

1.25

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS (4/4)
All of the warnings below are given so that the air bag is not obstructed in any way when it is inflated and also to prevent 
the risk of serious injuries caused by items which may be dislodged when the air bag inflates.

Warnings concerning the driver’s air bag
– Do not modify the steering wheel or the steering wheel boss.
– Do not cover the steering wheel boss under any circumstances.

–  Do not attach any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the steering wheel boss.
–  The steering wheel must not be removed (except by qualified personnel from our Network).
–  When driving, do not sit too close to the steering wheel. Sit with your arms slightly bent (see the information on “Adjusting 

your driving position” in Section 1). This will allow sufficient space for the air bag to deploy correctly and be fully effective.

Warnings concerning the passenger air bag
–  Do not attach or glue any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the dashboard on or near the air bag.
–  Do not place anything between the dashboard and the passenger (pet, umbrella, walking stick, parcels, etc.).
–  The passenger must not put his or her feet on the dashboard or seat as there is a risk that serious injuries may occur. In 

general, parts of the body should be kept away from the dashboard (knees, hands, head, etc.).

–  The devices in addition to the front passenger seat belt should be reactivated as soon as a child seat is removed, to ensure 

the protection of the passenger in the event of an impact.

A REAR-FACING CHILD SEAT MUST NOT BE FITTED TO THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNLESS 

THE ADDITIONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS, I.E. THE PASSENGER AIR BAG, ARE DEACTIVATED.

(refer to the information on “Child safety: deactivating/activating the front passenger air bag” in Section 1)

METHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE REAR SIDE SEAT BELTS
Force limiter
Above a certain severity of impact, this 
mechanism is used to limit the force of 
the belt against the body so that it is at 
an acceptable level.

–  Have  the  entire  restraint 
system checked following 
an accident.

– No operation whatsoever 
is  permitted  on  any  part  of  the 
system (air bags, electronic con-
trol units, wiring) and the system 
components must not be reused 
on any other vehicle, even if iden-
tical.

–  Only  qualified  personnel  from 
our Network may work on the air 
bags; otherwise the system may 
trigger  accidentally  and  cause 
injury.

1.27

SIDE PROTECTION DEVICES
Side Airbags
This airbag may be fitted to each of the 
front seats and is activated at the sides 
of the seats (door side) to protect the 
occupants in the event of a severe side 
impact.

Depending on the vehicle, a mark-
ing on the windscreen informs you 
of the presence of additional means 
of restraint (air bags, pretensioners, 
etc.) in the passenger compartment.

1.28

Warning relating to the side airbag 
– Fitting seat covers: seats equipped with an airbag require covers spe-
cifically designed for your vehicle. Contact an approved Dealer to find out 
if these covers are available. The use of any covers other than those de-
signed for your vehicle (and including those designed for another vehicle) may 
affect the operation of the airbags and reduce your protection.

–  Do not place any accessories, objects or even pets between the seatback, the 
door and the internal fittings. Do not cover the seatback with any items such as 
clothes or accessories. This may prevent the air bag from operating correctly 
or cause injury when the airbag is deployed.

–  No work or modification whatsoever may be carried out on the seat or internal 

fittings, except by qualified personnel from an approved Dealer.

–  This airbag operates through slits in the front seatbacks (door side): never 

insert any objects in these slits.

ADDITIONAL METHODS OF RESTRAINT
All of the warnings below are given so that the airbag is not obstructed in any way when it is inflated and also to prevent 
the risk of serious injuries caused by items which may be dislodged when it inflates.

The airbag is designed to complement the action of the seat belt. Both the air bags and seat belts are integral parts of 
the same protection system. It is therefore essential to wear seat belts at all times. If seat belts are not worn, the oc-
cupants are exposed to the risk of serious injury in the event of an accident. It may also increase the risk of minor su-
perficial injuries occurring when the airbag is deployed, although such minor injuries are always possible with air bags.
If the vehicle should overturn or in the event of a rear impact, however severe, the pretensioners and airbags are not always 
triggered. Impacts to the underside of the vehicle, e.g. from pavements, potholes or stones, can all trigger these systems.
–  No work or modification whatsoever may be carried out on any part of the airbag system (airbags, pretensioners, computer, 

wiring harness, etc.), except by qualified Network personnel.

–  To ensure that the system is in good working order and to avoid accidental triggering of the system which may cause injury, 

only qualified Network personnel may work on the airbag system.

–  As a safety precaution, have the airbag system checked if your vehicle has been involved in an accident, or is stolen or 

broken into.

–  When selling or lending the vehicle, inform the user of these points and hand over this handbook with the vehicle.
–  When scrapping your vehicle, contact your approved Dealer for disposal of the gas generator(s).

CHILD SAFETY: General information (1/2)
Carrying children
Please ensure that you comply with the 
legislation of your country.
Children, and adults, must be correctly 
seated and strapped in for all journeys. 
The children being carried in your vehi-
cle are your responsibility.
A child is not a miniature adult. Children 
are at risk of specific injuries as their 
muscles  and  bones  have  not  yet  fin-
ished  growing.  The  seat  belt  alone 
would not provide suitable protection. 
Use an approved child seat and ensure 
you use it correctly.

A  collision  at  30  mph 
(50 km/h) is the same as fall-
ing a distance of 10 metres. 
Transporting a child without 
a restraint is the equivalent of allow-
ing him or her to play on a fourth-
floor balcony without railings.
Never travel with a child held in your 
arms. In the event of an accident, 
you will not be able to keep hold of 
the  child,  even  if  you  yourself  are 
wearing a seat belt.
If your vehicle has been involved in 
a  road  accident,  replace  the  child 
seat  and  have  the  seat  belts  and 
ISOFIX anchorage points checked.

To prevent the doors being 
opened,  use  the  “Child 
safety” device (refer to the 
information  on  “Opening 
and closing the doors” in Section 1).

1.30

Driver’s  responsibility 
when parking or stopping 
the vehicle
Never  leave  an  animal, 
child or adult who is not self-suffi-
cient alone on your vehicle, even for 
a short time.
They may pose a risk to themselves 
or to others by starting the engine, 
activating  equipment  such  as  the 
electric  windows  or  by  locking  the 
doors.
Also, in hot and/or sunny weather, 
please remember that the tempera-
ture inside the passenger compart-
ment increases very quickly.
RISK  OF  DEATH  OR  SERIOUS 
INJURY.

CHILD SAFETY: General information (2/2)
Using a child seat
The level of protection offered by the 
child seat depends on its ability to re-
strain your child and on its installation. 
Incorrect installation compromises the 
protection it offers the child in the event 
of harsh braking or an impact.
Before purchasing a child seat, check 
that it complies with the regulations for 
the country you are in and that it can 
be fitted in your vehicle. Consult an ap-
proved dealer to find out which seats 
are recommended for your vehicle.
Before  fitting  a  child  seat,  read  the 
manual and respect its instructions. If 
you  experience  any  difficulties  during 
installation,  contact  the  manufacturer 
of the equipment. Keep the instructions 
with the seat.

Set a good example by always fas-
tening your seat belt and teaching 
your child:
–  to strap themselves in correctly;
–  to always get in and out of the car 
at the kerb, away from busy traf-
fic.

Do  not  use  a  second-hand  child 
seat  or  one  without  an  instruction 
manual.
Check that there are no objects in 
the vicinity of the child seat which 
could impede its operation.

Never  leave  a  child  unat-
tended in the vehicle.
Check  that  your  child  is 
always strapped in and that 
the  belt  or  safety  harness  used  is 
correctly  set  and  adjusted.  Avoid 
wearing bulky clothing which could 
cause the belts to slacken.
Never let your child put their head or 
arms out of the window.
Check that the child is in the correct 
position for the entire journey, espe-
cially if asleep.

1.31

CHILD SAFETY: choosing a child seat

Rear-facing child seats
A baby’s head is, proportionally, heavier 
than that of an adult and its neck is very 
fragile. Transport  the  child  in  this  po-
sition for as long as possible (until the 
age of 2 at the very least). It supports 
both the head and the neck.
Choose a bucket type seat for best side 
protection and change it as soon as the 
child’s head is higher than the shell.

Forward-facing child seats
The child’s head and abdomen need to 
be protected as a priority. A forward-fac-
ing child seat which is firmly attached to 
the vehicle will reduce the risk of impact 
to the head. Ensure your child travels in 
a forward-facing seat with a harness for 
as long as their size permits.
Choose a bucket type seat for optimum 
side protection.

Booster cushions
From  15  kg  or  4  years,  the  child  can 
travel using a booster seat, which will 
enable the seat belt to be adapted to 
suit his/her size and shape. The boos-
ter  seat  cushion  must  be  fitted  with 
guides to position the seat belt on the 
child’s thighs rather than the stomach. 
It is recommended that you use a seat-
back fitted with a belt strap guide which 
can be adjusted in terms of height to 
position the seat belt in the centre of the 
shoulder. It must never rest on the neck 
or on the arm.
Choose a bucket type seat for optimum 
side protection.

1.32

Before  using  an  ISOFIX 
child  seat  that  you  pur-
chased for another vehicle, 
check that its installation is 
authorised.  Consult  the  list  of  ve-
hicles which can be fitted with the 
seat from the equipment manufac-
turer.

CHILD SAFETY: choosing a child/baby seat mounting (1/2)
There are two ways of attaching child 
seats:  via  the  seat  belt  or  using  the 
ISOFIX system.
Attachment via the seat belt
The  seat  belt  must  be  adjusted  to 
ensure that it is effective in the event of 
harsh braking or an impact.
Ensure  that  the  strap  paths  indicated 
by the child seat manufacturer are re-
spected.
Always check that the seat belt is cor-
rectly  fastened  by  pulling  it  up,  then 
pulling it out fully whilst pressing on the 
child seat.
Check that the seat is correctly held by 
moving  it  from  side  to  side  and  back 
to front: the seat should remain firmly 
fixed.
Check that the child seat has not been 
installed at an angle and that it is not 
resting against a window.

The  seat  belt  must  never 
be  twisted  or  the  tension 
relieved.  Never  pass  the 
shoulder  strap  under  the 

arm or behind the back.
Check  that  the  seat  belt  has  not 
been damaged by sharp edges.
If the seat belt does not operate nor-
mally,  it  will  not  protect  the  child. 
Consult an approved dealer. Do not 
use this seat until the seat belt has 
been repaired.

Do  not  use  the  child  seat 
if it may unfasten the seat 
belt restraining it: the base 
of the seat must not rest on 
the buckle and/or catch of the seat 
belt.

Attachment using the ISOFIX 
system
Authorised ISOFIX child seats are ap-
proved  in  accordance  with  regulation 
ECE-R44 in one of the three following 
cases:
–  ISOFIXuniversal 3-point forward-fac-

ing seat;

–  ISOFIXsemi-universal 2-point seat;
–  specific.
For the latter two, check that your child 
seat can be installed by consulting the 
list of compatible vehicles.
Attach the child seat with the ISOFIX 
locks, if these are provided. The ISOFIX 
system allows quick, easy, safe fitting.
The ISOFIX system consists of 2 rings 
and, in some cases, a third ring.

No  modifications  may  be 
made  to  the  component 
parts of the restraint system 
(seat  belts,  ISOFIX  and 
seats and their mountings) originally 
fitted.

1.33

CHILD SAFETY: choosing a child/baby seat mounting (2/2)

2

The  two  rings 1  are  located  between 
the seatback and the seat base of the 
seat and are identified by a marking.
The third ring 3 or 4 is used to attach 
the upper strap on some child seats.

3

Rear seats
Put the rear parcel shelf down in order 
to be able to pass the strap 2 between 
the seatback and the parcel shelf (see 
the information on “Rear parcel shelf” in 
Section 3). Fix the hook on the ring 3, 
identified  by  the    symbol  on  the 
back of the seat in question and located 
under the mobile floor.

The ISOFIX anchorage points have been exclusively designed for child 
seats with the ISOFIX system. Never fit a different type of child seat, seat 
belt or other objects to these anchorage points.
Check that nothing is obstructing the anchorage points.

If your vehicle has been involved in a road accident, have the ISOFIX anchorage 
points checked and replace your child seat.

1.34

4

Front passenger seat
Attach the belt hook 2 to the ring 4.
All seats
Pull the belt 2 so that the back of the 
child seat comes into contact with the 
back of the vehicle seat.

Check  that  the  seatback 
of  the  forward-facing  child 
seat  is  in  contact  with  the 
back  of  the  vehicle  seat. 
In this case, the child seat may not 
always rest on the base of the vehi-
cle seat.

CHILD SAFETY: fitting a child seat (1/4)
Some seats are not suitable for fitting 
child seats. The diagram on the follow-
ing  page  shows  you  how  to  attach  a 
child seat.
The types of child seat indicated may 
not be available. Before using a differ-
ent child seat, check with the manufac-
turer that it can be fitted.

Ensure  that  the  child  seat 
or  the  child’s  feet  do  not 
prevent the front seat from 
locking  correctly.  Refer  to 
the information on the “Front seat” 
in Section 1.
Check that when installing the child 
seat in the vehicle it is not at risk of 
coming loose from its base.
If you have to remove the headrest, 
check that it is correctly stored so 
that it does not come loose under 
harsh braking or impact.
Always attach the child seat to the 
vehicle even if it is not in use so that 
it does not come loose under harsh 
braking or impact.

In the front seat
The  laws  concerning  children  travel-
ling in the front passenger seat differ in 
every country. Consult the legislation in 
force and follow the indications on the 
diagram on the following page.
Before fitting a child seat in this seat (if 
authorised):
–  lower the seat belt as far as possible;
–  move the seat as far back as possi-

ble;

–  gently  tilt  the  seatback  away  from 

vertical (approximately 25°);

–  on equipped vehicles, raise the seat 

base as far as possible.

In all situations, reinsert the headrest to 
its full extent so that it does not interfere 
with the child seat (see the information 
on “Front headrests” in Section 1);

After installing the child seat, when this 
is  possible,  you  can  move  the  vehi-
cle seat forward if necessary (so as to 
leave enough space in the rear seats 
for passengers or other child seats). In 
the case of a rear-facing child seat, do 
not let it touch the dashboard or move it 
to the furthest forward position.
Do not change other settings after in-
stalling the child seat.

RISK  OF  DEATH  OR 
SERIOUS INJURY: Before 
installing a child seat on the 
front passenger seat, check 
that  the  airbag  has  been  deacti-
vated (please refer to “Child safety: 
front passenger airbag deactivation 
and activation” in Section 1).

CHILD SAFETY: fitting a child seat (2/4)
In the rear side seat
A carrycot can be installed across the 
vehicle  and  will  take  up  at  least  two 
seats.
Position the child with their feet nearest 
the door.
Move the front seat as far forward as 
possible  to  install  a  rear-facing  child 
seat, then move back the seat in front 
as far as it will go, although without al-
lowing it to come into contact with the 
child seat.
For  the  safety  of  the  child  in  the  for-
ward-facing position:
–  Move  the  relevant  seat  backwards 

as far as possible;

–  Move  the  seat  in  front  of  the  child 
forwards, and set the position of the 
seatback to avoid contact between 
the seat and the child’s legs.

Always remove the headrest from the 
rear seat used for the child seat (see 
“Rear headrests” in Section 3). If nec-
essary,  position  the  rear  seat  as  far 
back  as  possible. This  must  be  done 
before fitting the child seat. Check that 
the  child  seat  is  resting  against  the 
back of the vehicle seat.

1.36

A child seat with floor sup-
ports  must  never  be  in-
stalled  on  the  rear  centre 
seat.

RISK  OF  DEATH  OR  SERIOUS 
INJURY.

Fit the child seat in a rear 
seat wherever possible.
Fitting  a  seat  ISOFIX  in 
the  rear-left  seat  means 
the  middle  seat  cannot  be  used. 
The central seat belt will no longer 
be either accessible or useable. To 
install an ISOFIX seat in this seat, 
detach the central seat belt by hand 
before engaging the bolts.

Mileage before service
With the ignition switched on, the engine not running and 
the display set to “SERVICE INTERVALS”, press button 2 or 3  
for approximately 5 seconds to display the mileage before serv-
ice (distance or time to the next service). When the range ap-

one month: the message “Service due in” is displayed, ac-
companied by the nearest term (distance or time);

–   range equal to 0 km/miles or service date reached: the 
message “Service required ” is displayed accompanied by

The vehicle requires an oil change as soon as possible.

Depending on the vehicle, the mileage before an oil change varies according to the driving style (frequent driving at low speed, 
door-to-door journeys, extensive use at idling speed, towing a trailer, etc.). The distance remaining until the next oil change can 
therefore decrease more quickly in some cases than the actual distance travelled.
Resetting: to reset the mileage before the next service, press and hold button 2 or 3  for approximately 10 seconds until the

STEERING WHEEL/POWER-ASSISTED STEERING

Power Assisted Steering
Never  drive  with  an  inadequately 
charged battery.

Variable power assisted 
steering
The  variable  power  assisted  steering 
system is equipped with an electronic 
control system which alters the level of 
assistance to suit the vehicle speed.
Steering is made easier during parking 
manoeuvres (for added comfort) whilst 
the  force  needed  to  steer  increases 
progressively  as  the  speed  rises  (for 
enhanced safety at high speeds).

1

Adjusting the steering wheel 
height and depth
Pull  lever 1  and  place  the  steering 
wheel in the required position; push the 
lever beyond the point of resistance to 
lock the steering wheel in place.
Make  sure  that  the  steering  wheel  is 
correctly locked.

For  safety  reasons,  only 
adjust  the  steering  wheel 
when the vehicle is station-
ary.

Never  leave  the  steering  wheel  at 
full lock while stationary.

With  the  engine  switched  off,  or  if 
there is a system fault, it is still pos-
sible to turn the steering wheel. The 
force required will be greater.

Never  switch  off  the  igni-
tion  when  travelling  down-
hill,  and  avoid  doing  so  in 
normal  driving  (assistance 

is not provided).

of heat or flame.
Do  not  wash  the  filler  area  with  a 
high-pressure washer.

Do  not  mix  even  small 
amounts  of  petrol  (un-
leaded or E85) with diesel. 
Do  not  use  ethanol-based 
fuel if your vehicle is not compatible 
with this fuel.
Do  not  add  additive  to  the  fuel  –
otherwise  you  risk  damaging  the 
engine.

FUEL TANK (2/3)
Filling with fuel
With the ignition off, insert the nozzle 
and insert it fully before turning it on to 
fill the fuel tank (risk of splashing).
Keep the nozzle in this position through-
out the entire filling operation.
When the pump cuts out automatically 
at  the  end  of  the  filling  procedure,  a 
maximum of two further filling attempts 
may be made, as there must be suffi-
cient space in the fuel tank to allow for 
expansion.
Make sure that no water enters the fuel 
tank during filling. The cover A and its 
surround must remain clean.
Petrol versions
Using  leaded  petrol  will  damage  the 
antipollution system and may lead to a 
loss of warranty.
To ensure that the fuel tank is not filled 
with  leaded  petrol,  the  fuel  tank  filler 
neck contains a restrictor fitted with a 
foolproof  system  which  only  allows 
the nozzle for unleaded petrol to be 
used (at the pump).

Vehicle fitted with the Stop and 
Start function
To fill up with fuel, the engine must 
be  stopped  (and  not  on  standby): 
stop  the  engine  by  pressing  the 
engine stop button 3 (please refer 
to the information on “Starting and 
Stopping the engine” in Section 2).

Persistent fuel odour
If  you  notice  a  persistent 
fuel odour you should:

–  stop the vehicle as soon as traf-
fic conditions allow and switch off 
the ignition;

–  switch  on  the  hazard  warning 
lights and ask your passengers to 
leave the vehicle and stay clear 
of the traffic;

–  contact an approved Dealer.

Running out of fuel on diesel 
versions
Vehicles with priming bulb 4
After  a  breakdown  caused  by  com-
pletely running out of fuel, the system 
must be reprimed before the engine is 
restarted:
Fill  the  tank  with  at  least  8  litres  of 
diesel fuel.
Press priming bulb 4 several times.
The engine can now be restarted.
If the engine does not start after several 
attempts, contact an approved Dealer.

Vehicles without priming bulb 4
Insert  the  RENAULT  card  into  the  5 
card  reader.  Press  the  start  button  3 
without pressing any of the pedals. Wait 
a few minutes before starting. This will 
enable the fuel circuit to be primed. If 
the  engine  does  not  start,  repeat  the 
procedure.

1.78

No  modifications  what-
soever  are  permitted  on 
any part of the fuel supply 
system  (electronic  units, 
wiring,  fuel  circuit,  injectors,  pro-
tective covers, etc.) as this may be 
dangerous  (unless  undertaken  by 
qualified Network personnel).

The  engine  may  be  hot 
when working in close prox-
imity. In addition, the engine 
cooling fan may come on at 

any moment.

keep trying to start the engine, but con-
tact an approved Dealer.

Do not park the vehicle or 
run the engine in locations 
where  combustible  sub-
stances or materials such as 
grass or leaves can come into con-
tact with the hot exhaust system.

SPECIAL FEATURES OF DIESEL VERSIONS
Diesel engine speed
Diesel engines are fitted with an injec-
tion pump which prevents the engine 
speed being exceeded irrespective of 
the gear selected.
If  the  message  “Check  antipollution 
system” is displayed along with warn-
ing lights Ä and ©, consult an 
authorised dealer immediately. 
When  driving,  depending  on  the  fuel 
grade  used,  it  is  possible  that  white 
smoke may be emitted.
This is due to the exhaust particle filter 
being cleaned automatically, and does 
not affect the way the vehicle runs.

Precautions to be taken in 
winter
To avoid any faults in icy weather:
–  ensure that the battery is always fully 

–  always  keep  the  diesel  tank  rela-
tively full to avoid water vapour con-
densing in it and accumulating at the 
bottom of the tank.

Running out of fuel
If  the  tank  has  been  completely 
drained, the system must be reprimed 
after the tank is refilled: see information 
on the “fuel tank” in section 1 before re-
starting the engine.

Do not park the vehicle or 
run the engine in locations 
where  combustible  sub-
stances  or  materials  such 
as  grass  or  leaves  can  come  into 
contact with the hot exhaust system.

DRIVING ADVICE, ECO DRIVING (4/5)

–  Avoid sudden acceleration.
–  Brake as little as possible. If you an-
ticipate  an  obstacle  or  bend  in  ad-
vance, you may then simply release 
the accelerator pedal.

–  Do  not  try  to  maintain  the  same 
speed up a hill, accelerate no more 
than  you  would  on  the  level.  Keep 
your foot in the same position on the 
accelerator pedal.

–  Double declutching and accelerating 
before switching off are unnecessary 
in modern vehicles.

–  Bad weather, flooded roads:

Obstructions to the driver
On  the  driver’s  side,  only 
use mats adapted to the ve-
hicle that attach to the pre-
installed parts, and regularly check 
their mounting. Do not place several 
mats on top of each other.
There  is  a  risk  of  wedging  the

DRIVING ADVICE, ECO DRIVING (5/5)

Tyres
–  An underinflated tyre increases fuel 

consumption.

–  The use of non-recommended tyres 

can increase fuel consumption.

Advice on use
–  Opt for ECO mode.
–  Electricity  is  fuel;  switch  off  all  the 
electrical  components  which  are 
not really needed. However (safety 
first), keep your lights on when the 
visibility is bad (“see and be seen”).

–  Use  the  air  vents.  Driving  with  the 
windows open at 60 mph (100 km/h) 
will  increase  fuel  consumption  by 
4%.

–  Never  fill  the  fuel  tank  right  to  the 

brim to avoid overflow.

–  In  vehicles  fitted  with  air  condi-
tioning,  it  is  normal  to  observe  an 
increase in fuel consumption (espe-
cially in urban conditions) when it is 
used. For vehicles fitted with manual 
air conditioning, switch off the system 
when it is not required.
Advice for reducing consumption 
and therefore helping to preserve 
the environment:
If the vehicle has been parked in the 
sun,  open  the  doors  for  a  few  mo-
ments to let the hot air escape before 
starting the engine.

–  Do  not  leave  an  empty  roof  rack

MAINTENANCE AND ANTIPOLLUTION ADVICE 
Your vehicle complies with criteria for 
recycling and recovering vehicles at the 
end of their service life, which entered 
into force in 2015.
Some parts of your vehicle have there-
fore been designed to facilitate future 
recycling.
These  parts  are  easy  to  remove  so 
that they can be recovered and reproc-
essed by recycling companies.
By  virtue  of  its  design,  moderate  fuel 
consumption  and  initial  settings,  your 
vehicle also conforms to current anti-
pollution  regulations.  The  manufac-
turer is actively striving to reduce pol-
lutant  exhaust  gas  emissions  and  to 
save energy. But the fuel consumption 
of your vehicle and the level of pollutant 
exhaust  gas  emissions  are  also  your 
responsibility.  Ensure  that  it  is  main-
tained and used correctly.

In  addition,  replacing  engine,  fuel 
supply  system  and  exhaust  compo-
nents with parts other than those origi-
nally  recommended  by  the  manufac-
turer may alter your vehicle so that it 
no  longer  complies  with  anti-pollution 
regulations.
Have  your  vehicle  adjusted  and 
checked by an authorised dealer, in ac-
cordance with the instructions given in 
your  maintenance  schedule:  they  will 
have all the equipment necessary for 
ensuring that your vehicle is maintained 
to its original standard.

Engine adjustments
–  Spark  plugs:  for  optimum  condi-
tions of use, output and performance 
the specifications laid down by our 
Design Department must be strictly 
applied.
If the spark plugs have to be changed, 
use the make, type and gap specified 
for your vehicle’s engine. Contact an 
authorised dealer for this.

 

Maintenance
It  is  important  to  remember  that  fail-
ure to respect antipollution regulations 
could lead to legal action being taken 
against the vehicle owner.

2.18

–  Air filter, fuel filter: a choked ele-
ment  will  reduce  efficiency.  It  must 
be replaced.

–  Ignition and idle speed: no adjust-

ment is needed.

Exhaust gas monitoring 
system
The exhaust gas monitoring system will 
detect any operating faults in the vehi-
cle’s antipollution system.
If this system malfunctions, toxic sub-
stances  may  be  released  into  the  at-
mosphere or damage may occur.
Ä This  warning  light  on  the  in-
strument panel will indicate if 
there are any faults in the system:
This  lights  up  when  the  ignition  is 
switched  on  and  goes  out  when  the 
engine is started.
–  If it lights up continuously, consult an 
approved Dealer as soon as possi-
ble;

–  if it flashes, reduce the engine speed 
until the light stops flashing. Contact 
an authorised dealer as soon as pos-
sible.

ENVIRONMENT
Your  vehicle  has  been  designed  with 
respect for the environment in mind for 
its entire service life: during production, 
use and at the end of its life.
This  commitment  is  illustrated  by  the 
Renault eco² signature.

Manufacture
Your vehicle has been manufactured at 
a factory which complies with a policy 
to  reduce  the  environmental  impact 
on the surrounding areas (reduction of 
water and energy consumption, visual 
and noise pollution, atmospheric emis-
sions and waste water; sorting and re-
using waste).

Emissions
Your  vehicle  has  been  designed  to 
emit  fewer  greenhouse  gases  (CO2) 
while in use, and therefore to consume 
less fuel (eg. 140 g/km, equivalent to 
5.3  l/100 km for a diesel vehicle).
Our vehicles are also equipped with a 
particle filter system including a cata-
lytic converter, an oxygen sensor and 
an  active  carbon  filter  (the  latter  pre-
vents vapour from the fuel tank being 
released into the open air).
For certain diesel vehicles, this system 
also has a particle filter to reduce the 
volume of soot particles emitted.

Please make your own 
contribution towards 
protecting the environment 
too
–  Worn parts replaced in the course of 
routine  vehicle  maintenance  (vehi-
cle battery, oil filter, air filter, batter-
ies, etc.) and oil containers (empty or 
filled with used oil) must be disposed 
of through specialist organisations.

–  At  the  end  of  the  vehicle’s  service 
life,  it  should  be  sent  to  approved 
centres to ensure that it is recycled.
–  In all cases, comply with local legis-

lation.

Recycling
Your  vehicle  is  85%  recyclable  and 
95% recoverable.
To achieve these objectives, many of 
the vehicle components have been de-
signed to enable them to be recycled. 
The  materials  and  structures  have 
been carefully designed to allow these 
components to be easily removed and 
reprocessed by specialist companies.
In  order  to  preserve  raw  material  re-
sources, this vehicle incorporates nu-
merous parts made from recycled plas-
tics or renewable materials (vegetable 
or  animal-derived  materials  such  as 
cotton or wool).

2.19

TYRE PRESSURE LOSS WARNING (1/3)

1

When fitted to the vehicle, this system 
notifies the driver if one or more tyres 
lose pressure.

Operating principle
This system detects a loss of pressure 
in  one  of  the  tyres  by  measuring  the 
wheel speed while driving.
Warning  light   1  comes  on  to 
alert the driver in the event of insuffi-
cient  pressure  (deflated  wheel,  punc-
tured tyre, etc.).
Operating conditions
The  system  should  be  reset  with  an 
inflation  pressure  equal  to  that  given 
on  the  tyre  inflation  pressure  label. 
Otherwise it risks not giving a reliable 
warning in the event of a significant loss 
of pressure. Please refer to the informa-
tion on “Tyre pressures” in Section 4.

In the following situations, the system 
risk coming into action late or not func-
tioning correctly:
–  system not reset after reinflation or 

any operation on the wheels;

–  system badly reset: different inflation 
pressures  from  the  recommended 
pressures;

–  significant change in load or distribu-
tion of load on one side of the vehi-
cle;

–  sporty driving with strong accelera-

tion;

–  driving on snowy or slippery surface;
–  driving with snow chains;
–  fitting a single new tyre;
–  use of tyres not approved by the net-

work.

–  ...

This function is an additional driving aid.
The function does not take the place of the driver. It cannot, therefore, 
under any circumstances replace the vigilance or the responsibility of the 
driver.

Check the tyre pressures, including the emergency spare wheel, once a month.

2.20

TYRE PRESSURE LOSS WARNING (2/3)

Resetting the standard level for the 
tyre pressures
This should be done:
–  after each reinflation or readjustment 

of the pressure of one of the tyres;

–  when  the  standard  tyre  pressure 
needs  to  be  changed  to  adapt  to 
usage conditions (empty, carrying a 
load, motorway driving, etc.);

–  after changing a wheel;
–  after using the tyre inflation kit;

–  after  swapping  a  wheel  (however, 

this practice is not recommended).

It should always be done after checking 
the tyre pressure of all four tyres when 
cold.
Tyre pressures must correspond to the 
current  usage  of  the  vehicle  (empty, 
carrying a load, motorway driving, etc.).
Resetting procedure
With the ignition on:
–  repeatedly  press  one  of  the  but-
tons  3  or  4  to  select  the  “TYRE 
PRESSURE : SET TPW” function on 
the display 2;

–  press and hold (around 3 seconds) 
button  3  or  4  to  start  initialisation. 
The  display  of  the  message  “SET 
TPW  LAUNCHED”  for  around  five 
seconds indicates that the reset re-
quest for the tyre pressure reference 
value has been taken into account.

Reinitialisation is carried out after a few 
minutes’ driving.

Display
The display 2 on the instrument panel 
informs you of any tyre pressure faults 
(flat tyre, punctured tyre, etc.).
“INFLATE TIRES AND SET TPW”
Warning light  comes on, along 
with  the  message  “INFLATE  TIRES 
AND SET TPW”. They indicate that at 
least one tyre is flat or punctured.
In the event of a flat tyre, inflate the re-
levant tyre.
In the event of a puncture, change the 
tyre or consult an authorised dealer. 
Check and readjust the pressure of the 
four  tyres  when  cold,  and  launch  the 
reset  of  the  tyre  pressure  reference 
value.  Warning  light   goes  out 
after launching the reinitialisation of the 
tyre pressure reference value.

The  sudden  loss  of  pressure  in  a 
tyre (burst tyre, etc.) cannot be de-
tected by the system.

2.21

TYRE PRESSURE LOSS WARNING (3/3)
“RECALIBRATE SET TPW”
The  warning  light   flashes  for 
several seconds, then stays on, along 
with the message “RECALIBRATE SET 
TPW”.
They indicate that the request to reset 
the  reference  value  of  the  tyre  pres-
sures must be restarted.
“TPW NOT AVAILABLE”
The warning light  flashes for sev-
eral seconds, then stays on, along with 
the message “TPW NOT AVAILABLE”.
They  indicate  that  the  vehicle  is 
equipped  with  an  emergency  spare 
wheel which is smaller than the other 
four and that it is fitted to the vehicle.
“CHECK TPW”
The  warning  light   flashes  for 
several seconds, then stays on, along 
with the message “CHECK TPW”.
This message is accompanied by the 
warning light ©.
They  indicate  a  system  fault.  Please 
consult an authorised dealer.

Readjustment of tyre pressures
The tyre pressures must be adjusted 
when cold (please refer to the label lo-
cated on the edge of the driver’s door).
If  tyre  pressures  cannot  be  checked 
when  the  tyres  are  cold,  the  recom-
mended pressures should be increased 
by 0.2 to 0.3 bar (3 PSI).
Never deflate a hot tyre.
After each reinflation or readjustment of 
the tyre pressure, launch the reinitiali-
sation  of  the  tyre  pressure  reference 
value.
Replacing wheels/tyres
Only  use  equipment  approved  by  the 
brand  network,  or  the  system  risks 
being  activated  late  or  not  operating 
correctly. Please see the information on 
“Tyres” in Section 5.

After each change of wheel/tyre, read-
just  the  tyre  pressure  and  launch  the 
reset  of  the  tyre  pressure  reference 
value.
Emergency spare wheel
If fitted on the vehicle, readjust the tyre 
pressure and launch the reinitialisation 
of the tyre pressure reference value.
Tyre repair product and inflation kit
Only  use  equipment  approved  by  the 
brand  network,  or  the  system  risks 
being  activated  late  or  not  operating 
correctly. Please refer to “Tyre inflation 
kit” in Section 5.
After using the tyre inflation kit, readjust 
the tyre pressure and launch the reini-
tialisation of the tyre pressure reference 
value.

DRIVING CORRECTION DEVICES AND AIDS (1/5)
Depending on the vehicle, this is com-
posed of:
–  anti-lock braking system (ABS);
–  electronic stability program (ESC) 
with understeer control and trac-
tion control;

–  driver assistance with a trailer;
–  emergency brake assist;
–  grip control;
–  hill start assistance.

Anti-lock braking system 
(ABS)
Under heavy braking, the ABS prevents 
the  wheels  from  locking,  allowing  the 
stopping distance to be managed and 
keeping control of the vehicle.
Under these circumstances, the vehi-
cle can be steered to avoid an obstacle 
whilst braking. In addition, this system 
can increase stopping distances, par-
ticularly on roads with low surface grip 
(wet ground etc.).
You  will  feel  a  pulsation  through  the 
brake  pedal  each  time  the  system  is 
activated.  The  ABS  does  not  in  any 
way improve the vehicle's physical per-
formance relating to the road surface 
and road-holding. It is still essential to 
follow the rules of good driving practice 
(such as driving at a safe distance from 
the vehicle in front etc.).

In  an  emergency,  apply  firm  and 
continuous pressure to the brake 
pedal.  There  is  no  need  to  pump 
it  repeatedly.  The ABS  will  modu-
late the force applied in the braking 
system.

Operating faults:
–  The ©  and  x  come  on 
and  the  messages  “Check  ABS”, 
“CHECK BRAKING SYSTEM” and, 
depending  on  the  vehicle,  “Check 
ESC”  appear  on  the  instrument 
panel: the ABS, the ESC and emer-
gency brake assist are deactivated. 
Braking is always enabled;
–  The  x ,  D ,  ©  and 
®  come  on  and  the  message 
“BRAKING SYSTEM FAULT” is dis-
played on the instrument panel: this 
indicates a failure in the braking 
system.

In  both  cases,  please  consult  an 
Authorised Dealer.

Your  braking  systems 
are  partially  operational. 
However,  it  is  dangerous 
to  brake  suddenly  and 
it  is  essential  to  stop  immediately, 
as soon as traffic conditions allow. 
Contact an approved dealer.

2.23

DRIVING CORRECTION DEVICES AND AIDS (2/5)
Electronic stability program 
(ESC) with understeer control 
and traction control
Electronic stability control ESC
This system helps you to keep control 
of the vehicle in critical driving condi-
tions (avoiding an obstacle, loss of grip 
on a bend, etc.).
Operating principle
A sensor in the steering wheel detects 
the direction selected by the driver.
Other  sensors  throughout  the  vehicle 
measure the actual direction.
The  system  compares  driver  input  to 
the actual trajectory of the vehicle and 
corrects the trajectory if necessary by 
controlling the braking of certain wheels 
and/or engine power. In the event that 
the system is engaged, indicator light 
 flashes on the instrument panel.

Understeer control
This system optimises the action of the 
ESC in the case of pronounced under-
steer (loss of front axle road holding).
Traction control
This system helps to limit wheelspin of 
the drive wheels and to control the ve-
hicle when pulling away accelerating or 
decelerating.
Operating principle
Using  the  wheel  sensors,  the  system 
measures and compares the speed of 
the drive wheels at all times and slows 
down their over-rotation. If a wheel is 
starting to slip, the system brakes au-
tomatically until the drive supplied be-
comes compatible with the level of grip 
under the wheel again.
The  system  also  adjusts  the  engine 
speed  to  the  grip  available  under  the 
wheels, independently of the pressure 
exerted on the accelerator pedal.

Operating faults
When  the  system  detects  an  operat-
ing fault, the © and  warn-
ing lights come on and, depending on 
the vehicle, the message “Check ESC” 
appears  on  the  instrument  panel.  In 
this case, the ESC and traction control 
system are deactivated.
Consult an approved dealer.

These functions are an ad-
ditional aid in the event of 
critical  driving  conditions, 
enabling the vehicle behav-
iour to be adapted to suit the driving 
conditions.
However, the functions do not take 
the  place  of  the  driver.  They  do 
not increase the vehicle’s limits 
and  should  not  encourage  you 
to drive more quickly. Therefore, 
they  can  under  no  circumstances 
replace the vigilance or responsibil-
ity of the driver when manoeuvring 
the vehicle (the driver must always 
be ready for sudden incidents which 
may occur when driving).

2.24

DRIVING CORRECTION DEVICES AND AIDS (3/5)
Emergency brake assist
This  system  supplements  the  ABS 
and helps reduce vehicle stopping dis-
tances.
Operating principle
The system allows an emergency brak-
ing situation to be detected when the 
brake pedal is pressed. In this case, the 
braking assistance immediately devel-
ops maximum power and may trigger 
ABS regulation.
ABS braking is maintained as long as 
the brake pedal is applied.

Hazard warning lights switching on
Depending on the vehicle, these may 
light up in the event of sudden decel-
eration.
Braking anticipation
Depending  on  the  vehicle,  when  you 
rapidly  release  the  accelerator,  the 
system  anticipates  the  braking  ma-
noeuvre  in  order  to  reduce  stopping 
distances.
When using the cruise control:
–  if you use the accelerator, when you 
release  it,  the  system  may  be  trig-
gered;

–  if you do not use the accelerator, the 

system will not be triggered.

Operating faults
When the system detects an operating 
fault the message “CHECK BRAKING 
SYSTEM”  appears  on  the  instrument 
panel  along  with  the ©  warning 
light. 
Consult an approved dealer.

These functions are an ad-

Hill start assistance
Depending  on  the  gradient  of  the  in-
cline,  this  system  assists  the  driver 
when starting on a hill. It prevents the 
vehicle  from  rolling  backwards,  de-
pending on the slope, by automatically 
applying the brakes when the driver lifts 
his/her foot off the brake pedal to de-
press the accelerator pedal.
System operation
It only operates when the gear lever is 
in a position other than neutral (other 
than  N  or  P  for  automatic  transmis-
sions)  and  the  vehicle  is  completely 
stationary (brake pedal depressed)
The  system  holds  the  vehicle  for  ap-
proximately 2 seconds. The brakes are 
then gradually released (the vehicle will 
move according to the slope).

The  hill  start  assistance 
system  cannot  completely 
prevent  the  vehicle  from 
rolling backwards in all sit-
uations (extremely steep gradients 
etc.).
In all cases, the driver may depress 
the brake pedal to prevent the vehi-
cle from rolling backwards.
The  hill  start  assistance  function 
should  not  be  used  for  prolonged 
stops: use the brake pedal.
This function is not designed to im-
mobilise the vehicle permanently.
If necessary, use the brake pedal to

blind spot.

Display D
When  the  direction  indicator  is  acti-
vated, the indicator light 4 flashes when 
a vehicle is detected in the blind spot on 
the side towards which you are about to 
steer. If you cancel the direction indica-
tor, the function will return to the initial 
warning (display C).

The system’s detection range oper-
ates  according  to  a  standard  lane 
width.  If  you  are  driving  in  narrow 
traffic lanes, it may detect vehicles 
in other lanes.

Operating faults
If the system detects a fault, the mes-
sage  “Check  blind  spot  alert”  is  dis-
played on the instrument panel. Call an 
approved Dealer.
Note: when the engine is started, the 
indicator  light  4,  display  B,  flashes 
three times. It is normal.

B

C

D

– The  system’s  detection 
range  operates  according 
to a standard lane width. If 
you are driving in wide traf-
fic  lanes,  the  system  might  not 
be able to detect a vehicle in the 
blind spot.

–  The  system  might  be  disrupted 
momentarily  if  it  is  exposed  to 
strong  electromagnetic  waves 
(as  beneath  high-tension  power 
lines)  or  to  very  poor  weather 
conditions  (heavy  rain,  snow, 
etc.).  Remain  aware  of  driving 
conditions.

There is a risk of accidents.

Conditions for non-function
–  If the object is not moving;
–  if traffic is heavy;
–  the road is winding;
–  if front and rear sensors both detect 
objects at the same time (e.g. when 
passing an articulated lorry).

–  ...

2.30

Because  sensors  have 
been  installed  in  the  bum-
pers, any work (repairs, re-
placements, touching up of 
paintwork) must be carried out by a 
qualified professional.

This  function  is  an  addi-
tional  aid  which  indicates 
other  vehicles  in  the  blind 
spot area.

It can never in any case be a sub-
stitute  for  care  nor  for  the  driver’s 
responsibility while in charge of his 
vehicle.
The driver should always be ready 
for  sudden  incidents  while  driv-
ing:  always  ensure  that  there  are 
no small, narrow moving obstacles 
(such as a child, animal, pushchair, 
bicycle, stone, post, etc.) in the blind 
spot when manoeuvring.

The  speed  limiter  function  helps  you 
stay within the driving speed limit that 
you choose, known as the limit speed.

Controls
1  Main “On/Off” switch.
2  Limit speed activation, storage and 

increase switch (+).

3  Decreasing the limit speed (-).
4  Activation and recall of memorised 

limit speed (R).

5  Speed limiter function standby (with 

limited speed memory) (O).

Switching on
Press switch 1 on the side showing . 
Indicator light 6 comes on, lit orange, 
and  the  message  “SPEED  LIMITER” 
appears  on  the  instrument  panel,  ac-
companied by dashes to indicate that 
the speed limiter function is activated 
and waiting to store a limit speed. 
To  store  the  current  speed,  press 
switch 2 (+): the limited speed will re-
place the dashes.
The minimum stored speed is 20 mph 
(30 km/h).

2.31

Exceeding the limit speed
It is possible to exceed the limit speed 
at any time. To do this: press the accel-
erator pedal firmly and fully (beyond 
the resistance point).
While  the  speed  is  exceeded,  the 
speed  limit  flashes  on  the  instrument 
panel and, depending on the vehicle, a 
beep sounds.
Then,  release  the  accelerator:  the 
speed  limiter  function  will  return  as 
soon as you reach a speed lower than 
the stored speed.
Limited speed cannot be maintained
If driving up or down a steep gradient, 
the  system  is  unable  to  maintain  the 
limited  speed:  the  memorised  speed 
flashes  on  the  instrument  panel  and 
a  beep  sounds  at  regular  intervals  to 
inform you.

Varying the limit speed
The limit speed may be changed by re-
peatedly pressing:
–  switch 2 (+) to increase speed;
–  switch 3 (-) to reduce speed.

Driving
When a limited speed has been stored 
and this speed is not reached, driving is 
similar to driving a vehicle without the 
speed limiter function.
Once  you  have  reached  the  stored 
speed,  no  effort  on  the  accelera-
tor  pedal  will  allow  you  to  exceed 
the  programmed  speed  except  in  an 
emergency  (refer  to  information  on 
“Exceeding the limit speed”).

2.32

The speed limiter function is 
in no way linked to the brak-
ing system.

Putting the function on 
standby
The speed limiter function is suspended 
when you press the switch 5 (O). In this 
case,  the  limit  speed  remains  stored 
and, depending on the vehicle:
–  the  message  “Memorised”  and 
stored  speed  are  displayed  on  the 
instrument panel.

–  the  stored  speed  is  displayed  be-
tween <xxx> markers on the instru-
ment panel.

Recalling the limit speed
If a speed has been saved, it can be re-
called by pressing switch 4 ((R)).

When  the  speed  limiter  is  put  on 
standby,  pressing  switch  2  (+)  re-
activates the function without taking 
into account the stored speed: it is 
the  speed  at  which  the  vehicle  is 
moving that is taken into account.

Switching off the function
The  speed  limiter  function  is  deac-
tivated  if  you  press  switch  1:  in  this 
case a speed is no longer stored. The 
orange instrument panel warning light 
 goes out, confirming that the func-
tion is stopped.

2.33

CRUISE CONTROL (1/4)

The cruise control function helps you to 
maintain your driving speed at a speed 
that  you  choose,  called  the  cruising 
speed.
This cruising speed may be set at any 
speed above 20 mph (30 km/h).

This  function  is  an  addi-
tional driving aid. The func-
tion does not take the place 
of the driver.

Therefore, it can under no circum-
stances replace the driver’s respon-
sibility to respect speed limits and to 
be vigilant (the driver must always 
be ready to brake).
Cruise control must not be used in 
heavy traffic, on undulating or slip-
pery  roads  (black  ice,  aquaplan-
ing, gravel) and during bad weather 
(fog, rain, side winds etc.).
There is a risk of accidents.

Switching on
Press switch 1 side .
Indicator light 6 comes on, lit green, and 
the message “CRUISE CONTROL” ap-
pears on the instrument panel, accom-
panied by dashes to indicate that the 
cruise control function is activated and 
waiting to store a cruising speed. 

Please note that you must 
keep your feet close to the 
pedals  in  order  to  react  in 
an emergency.

Activating cruise control
At  a  steady  speed  (above  18  mph 
(30 km/h approximately)) press switch 2 
or (+): the function is activated and the 
current speed is saved.
The cruising speed replaces the dashes 
and the cruise control is confirmed by 
the  appearance  of  warning  light  7  lit 
green, as well as warning light 6.

Driving
Once  a  cruising  speed  is  stored  and 
the  cruise  control  function  is  active, 
you may lift your foot off the accelera-
tor pedal.

2.35

Exceeding the cruising speed
The cruising speed may be exceeded 
at any time by depressing the accelera-
tor pedal. While it is being exceeded, 
the  cruising  speed  flashes  on  the  in-
strument panel.
Then, release the accelerator: after a 
few seconds, the vehicle will automati-
cally return to its set cruising speed.
Cruising speed cannot be 
maintained
When  driving  down  a  steep  gradient, 
the  system  is  unable  to  maintain  the 
cruising  speed:  the  stored  speed  will 
flash on the instrument panel informa-
tion display to inform you of this situ-
ation.

Putting the function on 
standby
The function is set to standby if you:
–  use the switch 5 (O);
–  the brake pedal;
–  depress the clutch pedal or the shift 
into neutral if the vehicle has an au-
tomatic gearbox.

In all three cases, the cruising speed 
remains stored and, depending on the 
vehicle:
–  the  message  “Memorised”  and 
stored  speed  are  displayed  on  the 
instrument panel.

–  the  stored  speed  is  displayed  be-
tween <xxx> markers on the instru-
ment panel.

Returning to the cruising speed
If a speed is stored, it can be recalled, 
once you are sure that the road con-
ditions  are  suitable  (traffic,  road  sur-
face,  weather  conditions,  etc.).  Press 
switch  4  (R)  if  the  vehicle  speed  is 
above 20 mph (30 km/h).
When the stored speed is recalled, acti-
vation of the cruise control is confirmed 
by  the  illumination  of  the    warning 
light.

NB:  if  the  speed  previously  stored  is 
much  higher  than  the  current  speed, 
the vehicle will accelerate more rapidly 
to reach this threshold.

Switching off the function
The  cruise  control  function  is  deacti-
vated if you press switch 1: in this case 
a speed is no longer stored. The two in-
strument panel warning lights  and 
 go out to confirm that the function is 
deactivated.

When the cruise control function is 
put  on  standby,  pressing  switch  2 
(+)  reactivates  the  cruise  control 
function without taking into account 
the stored speed: it is the speed at 
which the vehicle is moving that is 
taken into account.

Putting  the  cruise  control 
on  standby  or  switching  it 
off does not cause a rapid 
reduction  in  speed:  you 
must brake by depressing the brake 
pedal.

PARKING DISTANCE CONTROL (1/4)
Operating principle
Ultrasonic sensors in the rear bumper 
measure the distance between the ve-
hicle and an obstacle.
This  measurement  is  indicated  by 
beeps which become more frequent the 
closer you come to the obstacle, until 
they become a continuous beep when 
the  vehicle  is  approximately  20  to 
30 centimetres from the obstacle.
The  system  detects  obstacles  to  the 
front, the rear and the sides of the ve-
hicle.
The  parking  distance  control  system 
is  only  activated  when  the  vehicle  is 
driven at a speed below approximately 
6 mph (10 km/h).
The  parking  distance  control  system 
does not take into account towing and 
load carrying systems etc.

Special features
Ensure that the ultrasonic sensors indi-
cated by arrows 1 are not obscured (by 
dirt, mud, snow, etc.).

This  function  is  an  addi-
tional aid that indicates the 
distance between the vehi-
cle  and  an  obstacle  whilst 

reversing, using sound signals.
Under  no  circumstances  should  it 
replace the driver’s care or respon-
sibility whilst reversing.
The driver should always be ready 
for  sudden  incidents  while  driv-
ing:  always  ensure  that  there  are 
no small, narrow moving obstacles 
(such as a child, animal, pushchair, 
bicycle, stone, post etc.) in the blind 
spot when manoeuvring.

Note: the display 2 shows the vehicle 
surroundings and emits beeps.
It is necessary to travel a few metres 
before the side detection is activated.
If all areas have a grey background, the 
whole area around the vehicle is being 
monitored:
–  A: analysis of the vehicle surround-

ings in progress;

–  B: analysis of the vehicle surround-

ings carried out.

Operation
Most  objects  located  less  near  the 
front, rear and sides of the vehicle are 
detected.
Depending on the distance of the ob-
stacle,  the  frequency  of  the  beep  will 
be higher while approaching it, and will 
become a solid beep around 20 cm for 
obstacles to the sides, and 30 cm for 
obstacles  to  the  front  or  rear.  Green, 
orange and red zones will be displayed 
on the display C.

2.39

PARKING DISTANCE CONTROL (3/4)

If a side obstacle is detected:
–  the beeps become faster and then 
sound continuously as the obstacle 
gets nearer. Green, orange and red 
zones will be displayed on the dis-
play D;

–  if there is no risk of collision, no beep 
will sound when approaching the ob-
stacle. Green, orange and red zones 
will be displayed interspersed on the 
display D.

Note: in the event of a change in tra-
jectory during a manoeuvre, the risk of 
collision with an obstacles may be sig-
nalled late.

Detection of obstacles to the side
Depending  on  the  direction  of  the 
wheels, the system determines the tra-
jectory of the vehicle and notifies the 
driver of any risk or otherwise of a col-
lision with an obstacle 3 to the side of 
the vehicle.

2.40

An  impact  to  the  under-
side  of  the  vehicle  while 
manoeuvring  (e.g.:  strik-
ing  a  post,  raised  kerb  or 
other street furniture) may result in 
damage to the vehicle (e.g.: defor-
mation of an axle).
To avoid any risk of accident, have 
your  vehicle  checked  by  an  ap-
proved Dealer.

Operation
When going into reverse gear (and up 
to around 5 seconds after shifting into 
another  gear),  the  camera  1  placed 
next  to  the  lights  transmits  a  view  of 
the rear surroundings of the vehicle on 
the touch screen 2, accompanied by a 
mobile and fixed gauge.
This system is initially used with the aid 
of several gauges (mobile for trajectory 
and fixed for distance). When the red 
zone is reached, use the bumper image 
to stop accurately.

2.42

Note:
–  ensure that the reversing camera is 
not obscured (dirt, mud, snow, etc.);
–  depending  on  the  vehicle,  certain 
settings  can  be  adjusted  from  the 
touch screen 2. Refer to the hand-
book for the equipment.

This function is an additional 
aid.  It  cannot,  therefore, 
under  any  circumstances 
replace the vigilance or the 

responsibility of the driver.
The driver should always be ready 
for  sudden  incidents  while  driv-
ing:  always  ensure  that  there  are

2.44

Your speed should not exceed around 
4 mph (7 km/h).
Once  the  warning  light   on  the 
instrument panel goes off and a beep 
sounds, the manoeuvre has been com-
pleted.

ASSISTED PARKING (2/4)
Choice of manoeuvre
The system can perform four types of 
manoeuvres:
–  parallel parking;
–  perpendicular parking;
–  angle parking;
–  moving  out  of  a  parallel  parking 

space.

From  the  multifunction  screen,  select 
the manoeuvre to be performed.
Note: when starting the vehicle, or after 
having successfully completed parallel 
parking  using  the  system,  the  default 
manoeuvre proposed by the system is 
assistance in exiting a parallel parking 
space. In other cases, the default ma-
noeuvre can be set from the multifunc-
tion screen.

Operation
Parking
As  long  as  the  vehicle  speed  is  less 
than  20  mph  (30  km/h),  the  system 
looks for available parking spaces on 
both sides of the vehicle.
Once a space has been found, it is dis-
played on the multifunction screen, in-
dicated  by  a  small  letter  “P”.  So  that 
the  vehicle  can  detect  a  space,  drive 
slowly, with the indicators activated on 
the same side as the space, until the 
message  “Stop”  is  displayed,  along 
with a beep. 
The space is then indicated on the mul-
tifunction screen by a capital “P”.
–  Stop the vehicle;
–  select reverse gear.
The    indicator  light  lights  up 
on  the  instrument  panel  and  a  beep 
sounds;
–  release the steering wheel;
–  follow  the  system  instructions  pro-

vided on the multifunction screen.

Your speed should not exceed around 
4 mph (7 km/h).
Once in position to exit the space, the 
system will notify you of the end of the 
manoeuvre.
Once  the  warning  light   on  the 
instrument panel goes off and a beep 
sounds, the manoeuvre has been com-
pleted.

Suspending the manoeuvre
The manoeuvre is suspended in the fol-
lowing circumstances:
–  you take control of the wheel;
–  a door or the boot is opened;
–  the vehicle is at a standstill for too 

–  an obstacle in the direction of move-
ment prevents the manoeuvre from 
being completed;
–  the engine will stop.
Once  the  warning  light   on  the 
instrument panel goes off and a beep 
sounds, the manoeuvre has been sus-
pended.  To  resume  the  manoeuvre, 
press  and  hold  the  system  activation 
switch.

Exiting a parallel parking space
–  Select “Exit parallel parking space” 

long;

mode;

–  activate the direction indicator on the 

side you wish to go out of;

–  press  and  hold  switch  1  (around 
2 seconds).
The    indicator  light  lights  up 
on  the  instrument  panel  and  a  beep 
sounds;
–  release the steering wheel;
–  go  forwards  and  backwards  using 
the parking distance control system 
alerts.

In this case, the reason for suspending 
the manoeuvre will be displayed on the 
multifunction screen.
Make sure:
–  you have released the steering wheel 

–  that all doors and the boot are closed, 

and;

and;

–  that no obstacles are in the way of 

the direction of movement, and;

–  that the engine is started.

Cancelling the manoeuvre
The manoeuvre can be stopped in the 
following cases:
–  by  pressing  the  system  activation 

switch;

–  the  vehicle  speed  has  exceeded 

4 mph (7 km/h);

–  you have performed more than ten 
forwards/backwards  movements  in 
one manoeuvre;

–  the parking distance control sensors 

are dirty or blocked;
–  the vehicle wheels have skidded.
Once  the  warning  light   on  the 
instrument panel goes off and a beep 
sounds, the manoeuvre has been com-

ASSISTED PARKING (4/4)

This function is an additional driving aid. This function is not under any circumstances intended to replace the due care 
and attention of the driver, who should at all times be in control of the vehicle.
Make sure that the manoeuvre complies with the applicable traffic regulations at your location.

–  The driver should always be ready for sudden incidents while driving: always ensure that there are no small, narrow moving 

obstacles (such as a child, animal, pushchair, bicycle, stone, post etc.) in the blind spot when manoeuvring.

–  The system cannot detect objects located in the sensor blind spots.
–  When manoeuvring, the steering wheel may turn quickly: do not put your hands inside, and make sure that nothing is caught 

inside.

–  Always visually check that the parking space proposed by the system is still available and contains no obstacles.
–  The system should only be used when towing a trailer or when there is a towing or load carrying system on the vehicle.

move the lever out of position P.
Only engage D or R when the vehi-
cle is stopped, with your foot on the 
brake and the accelerator pedal re-
leased.

2.48

Driving in automatic mode
Move lever 1 to position D.
In  most  road  conditions  you  will  en-
counter, you will not need to touch your 
lever again: the gears will change au-
tomatically at the right time and at the 
most  suitable  engine  speed  because 
the  automatic  system  takes  into  ac-
count the vehicle load and road contour 
and adjusts itself to the particular driv-
ing style you have chosen.
Economical driving
When  driving,  always  leave  the  lever 
in position D, keeping the accelerator 
pedal lightly depressed to ensure auto-
matic gear changes at a lower engine 
speed.
Accelerating and overtaking
Depress  the  accelerator  pedal  firmly 
and  fully  (so  that  it  goes  beyond  the 
kickdown point).
This will enable you to change down 
to  the  optimum  gear  within  the 
engine range.

AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (2/3)

Special cases
In  certain  driving  conditions  (result-
ing in, for example, engine protection, 
operation  of  the  Electronic  Stability 
Control programme: ESC etc.) the au-
tomated system may change the gear 
automatically.
Likewise, to prevent incorrect manoeu-
vres, a gear change may be refused by 
the automatic system: in this case the 
gear display flashes for a few seconds 
as a warning.

Special circumstances
–  If the bends and road surface do 
not  allow  you  to  stay  in  automatic 
mode  (e.g.  in  the  mountains),  we 
recommend  that  you  change  to 
manual mode. This will prevent the 
automatic  gearbox  from  changing 
gear repeatedly when climbing, and 
permit  engine  braking  on  long  de-
scents.

–  In  cold  weather,  start  the  engine 
and  wait  a  few  seconds  before 
moving the selector lever from posi-

as possible.

An  impact  to  the  under-
side  of  the  vehicle  while 
manoeuvring  (e.g.:  strik-
ing  a  post,  raised  kerb  or 
other street furniture) may result in 
damage to the vehicle (e.g.: defor-
mation of an axle).
To avoid any risk of accident, have 
your  vehicle  checked  by  an  ap-
proved Dealer.

Switching the air 
recirculation on
Press button 6: the integrated indicator 
light comes on. In these conditions, air 
is taken from the passenger compart-
ment and is recycled, with no air being 
taken from outside the vehicle.

Air recirculation is for:
–  isolating the vehicle from the exter-
nal atmosphere (driving in polluted 
areas, etc.);

–  lowering  the  passenger  compart-
ment temperature as quickly as pos-
sible.

Prolonged use of air recirculation can lead to condensation forming on the side 
windows and windscreen, and discomfort due to the use of non-renewed air in 
the passenger compartment. We therefore advise you to return to normal mode 
(external air) as soon as the air recirculation function is no longer required, by 
pressing the button 6 again.

1
the passenger compartment) 
K
This function is managed automatically 
(operation  is  confirmed  by  a  warning 
light on button 7), but you can also acti-
vate it manually.
NB:
–  during recirculation, air is taken from 
the  passenger  compartment  and 
is recycled, with no air being taken 
from outside the vehicle;

–  air recirculation allows the external 
atmosphere to be cut off (when driv-
ing in polluted areas, etc.);

–  the recirculation of air makes it pos-
sible to reach the desired passenger 
compartment temperature quicker.

Manual use
Press button 7 – the integrated indica-
tor light comes on.
Prolonged use of this position may lead 
to  odours,  caused  by  non-renewal  of 
air, and the formation of condensation 
on the windows.
We therefore advise you to return to au-
tomatic mode as soon as air recircula-
tion is no longer needed, by pressing 
button 7.
To  exit  this  function,  press  button  7 
again.

The demisting/de-icing will still take 
priority over the air recirculation.

AIR CONDITIONING: information and operating instructions (1/2)
Advice on use
In  some  situations,  (air  conditioning 
off, air recirculation activated, ventila-
tion speed at zero or low, etc.) you may 
notice that condensation starts to form 
on the windows and windscreen.
If there is condensation, use the “Clear 
View” function to remove it, then use 
the air conditioning in automatic mode 
to stop it forming again.

Fuel consumption
You will normally notice an increase in 
fuel  consumption  (especially  in  town) 
when the air conditioning is operating.
For vehicles fitted with air conditioning 
with no automatic mode, switch off the 
system when it is not required.
Advice  for  reducing  consumption 
and helping to preserve the environ-
ment
Drive with the air vents open and the 
windows closed.
If  the  vehicle  has  been  parked  in  the 
sun, open the doors for a few moments 
to let the hot air escape before starting 
the engine.

Maintenance
Refer  to  the  Maintenance  Document 
for your vehicle for the inspection fre-
quency.

Operating faults
As  a  general  rule,  contact  your  ap-
proved dealer in the event of an oper-
ating fault.
–  Reduction in de-icing, demisting 

or air conditioning performance.
This may be caused by the passen-
ger compartment filter cartridge be-
coming clogged.

–  No cold air is being produced.

Check that the controls are set cor-
rectly and that the fuses are sound. 
Otherwise, switch off the system.

Presence of water under the 
vehicle
After  prolonged  use  of  the  air  condi-
tioning  system,  it  is  normal  for  water 
to be present under the vehicle. This is 
caused by condensation.

Do not add anything to the 
vehicle’s  ventilation  circuit 
(for  example,  to  remove 
bad odours).

There  is  a  risk  of  damage  or  of 
fire.

Use the air conditioning system reg-
ularly, even in cold weather, running 
it at least once a month for approxi-
mately 5 minutes.

Do not open the refriger-
ant fluid circuit. The fluid 
may damage eyes or skin.

properly locked.
Check  that  nothing  is  pre-
venting the catch from lock-

ing (gravel, cloth, etc.).

In the event of even a slight 
impact involving the radia-
tor  grille  or  bonnet,  have 
the bonnet lock checked by 
an approved dealer as soon as pos-
sible.

After carrying out any work 
in  the  engine  compart-
ment,  check  that  nothing 
has been left behind (cloth, 

tools, etc.).
These may damage the engine or 
cause a fire.

ENGINE OIL LEVEL: general information
It is normal for an engine to use oil for 
B
lubrication and cooling of moving parts 
and it is normal to top up the level be-
tween oil changes.
However,  contact  your  approved 
Dealer if more than 0.5 litres is being 
consumed every 600 miles (1,000 km) 
after the running in period.
Oil change frequency: check the oil 
level from time to time and certainly 
before any long journey to avoid the 
risk of damaging your engine.

–  remove the dipstick and wipe with a 

clean, lint-free cloth;

–  push the dipstick in as far as it will 
go (for vehicles equipped with a cap-
type dipstick C, screw the cap in as 
far as it will go);

–  take out the dipstick again;
–  read  the  level:  it  should  never  fall 
below  minimum  mark A  or  exceed 
maximum mark B.

Once  the  operation  has  been  com-
pleted,  ensure  that  the  dipstick  is 
pushed  in  as  far  as  it  will  go  or  that 
the  “cap-type  dipstick”  is  completely 
screwed in.

Reading the oil level
The oil level should be read with the ve-
hicle on level ground, after the engine 
has been switched off for some time.
The  dipstick  must  be  used  to  read 
the  exact  oil  level  and  make  sure 
that the maximum level has not been 
exceeded  (risk  of  engine  damage). 
Refer to the following pages.
The  instrument  panel  display  only 
alerts the driver when the oil level is at 
its minimum.

Topping up/filling
The  vehicle  must  be  parked  on  level 
ground and the engine should be cold 
(for  instance,  before  the  engine  is 
started up for the first time in the day).

Before  performing  any 
action  in  the  engine  com-
partment, the ignition must 
be switched off (please see 
the  information  on  “Starting,  stop-
ping the engine” in Section 2).

–  Unscrew cap 1;
–  top up the level (as a guide, the ca-
pacity  between  the  minimum  and 
maximum reading on the dipstick 2 
is between 1.5 and 2 litres, depend-
ing on the engine);

–  wait for approximately 10 minutes to 

allow the oil to flow into the engine;

–  check the level using the dipstick 2 

(as described above).

Once  the  operation  has  been  com-
pleted,  ensure  that  the  dipstick  is 
pushed in as far as it will go and that 
the cap is completely screwed in.

BATTERY

1

Depending on the vehicle, the battery 1 
is located under a cover and does not 
require any maintenance. You should 
not open it or add any fluid.
Replacing the battery
As this operation is complex, we advise 
you to contact an approved Dealer.

The  battery  is  a  specific 
type,  please  ensure  it  is 
replaced  with  the  same 
type. Consult an approved 

dealer.

4.12

Handle the battery with care 
as it contains sulphuric acid, 
which  must  not  come  into 
contact with eyes or skin. If 
it does, wash the affected area with 
plenty  of  cold  water.  If  necessary, 
consult a doctor.
Ensure that naked flames, red hot 
objects and sparks do not come into 
contact with the battery as there is a 
risk of explosion.

Please  note  when  work-
ing close to the engine that 
it  may  be  hot. The  engine 
cooling  fan  may  also  start 
at any moment. The  warning 
light in the engine compartment re-
minds you of this.

BODYWORK MAINTENANCE (1/3)
A  well-maintained  vehicle  will  last 
longer. It is therefore recommended to 
maintain the exterior of the vehicle reg-
ularly.
Your vehicle has been treated with very 
effective  anti-corrosion  products.  It  is 
nevertheless subject to various outside 
influences.
Corrosive agents in the atmosphere
–   atmospheric  pollution  (built-up  and 

industrial areas);

–   saline  atmospheres  (near  the  sea, 

particularly in hot weather);

–   seasonal and damp weather condi-
tions (e.g. road salt in winter, water 
from road cleaners, etc.).

Minor impacts
Abrasive action
Dust and sand in the air, mud, road grit 
thrown up by other vehicles, etc.
You should take a number of minor pre-
cautions in order to safeguard your ve-
hicle against such risks.

grime;

You should
Wash  your  car  frequently,  with  the 
engine off, with cleaning products rec-
ommended by the manufacturer (never 
use  abrasive  products).  Rinse  thor-
oughly beforehand with a jet:
–   spots  of  tree  resin  and  industrial 

–   mud in the wheel arches and under-
neath  the  body  which  forms  damp 
patches;

–   bird  droppings,  which  cause  a 
chemical reaction with the paint that 
rapidly discolours paintwork and 
may even cause the paint to peel 
off;
 wash  the  vehicle  immediately  to 
remove these marks since it is im-
possible to remove them by polish-
ing;

–   salt, particularly in the wheel arches 
and underneath the body after driv-
ing in areas where the roads have 
been gritted.

 

Remove any plant matter (resin, leaves, 
etc.) from the vehicle regularly.

Respect local regulations about wash-
ing vehicles (e.g. do not wash your ve-
hicle on a public highway).
Observe the vehicle stopping distances 
when driving on gravelled surfaces to 
prevent paint damage.
Repair, or have repaired quickly, areas 
where the paint has been damaged, to 
prevent corrosion spreading.
Remember to visit the body shop pe-
riodically  in  order  to  maintain  your 
anti-corrosion  warranty.  Refer  to  the 
Maintenance Document.
If  it  is  necessary  to  clean  mechani-
cal  components,  hinges,  etc.,  spray 
them  with  products  approved  by  our 
Technical Department to protect them 
after they have been cleaned.

We have selected special products 
to care for your vehicle and you can 
obtain these from the manufactur-
er’s accessory outlets.

4.13

BODYWORK MAINTENANCE (2/3)
What you should not do
Wash the vehicle in bright sunlight or 
freezing temperatures.
Do not scrape off mud or dirt without 
pre-wetting.
Allow dirt to accumulate on the exterior.
Allow rust to form following minor im-
pacts.
Do not use solvents not approved by 
our  Technical  Department  to  remove 
stains as this could damage the paint-
work.
Do not drive in snow or muddy condi-
tions without washing the vehicle, par-
ticularly  under  the  wheel  arches  and 
body.

Degrease or clean using 
high-pressure  cleaning 
equipment  or  by  spray-
ing  on  products  not  ap-
proved by our Technical 
Department:

–   mechanical  components 

(e.g.: 

engine compartment);

–   underbody;
–   parts  with  hinges  (e.g.:  inside  the 

–   painted plastic external fittings (e.g.: 

doors);

bumpers).

Doing this could give rise to corrosion 
or operational faults.

4.14

BODYWORK MAINTENANCE (3/3)
Vehicles with a matte paint 
finish
This type of paint requires certain pre-
cautions.
You should do the following
Wash the vehicle by hand using plenty 
of water, using a soft cloth or a gentle 
sponge.
Do not do the following
Use wax-based products (polishing).
Rub too hard.
Wash  the  vehicle  in  a  roller-type  car 
wash.
Attach stickers to the paintwork (risk of 
leaving marks).

Using a roller type car wash
Return  the  windscreen  wiper  stalk  to 
the Park position (refer to the informa-
tion on the “Windscreen washer, wiper” 
in  Section  1).  Check  the  mounting  of 
external accessories, additional lights 
and mirrors, and ensure that the wiper 
blades are secured with adhesive tape.
Remove  the  radio  aerial  mast  if  your 
vehicle is fitted with this equipment. 
Remember to remove the tape and refit 
the antenna after washing.

Wash 
the  vehicle 
using a high-pressure 
cleaning device.

Cleaning the headlights
As the headlights are made of plastic 
“glass”, use a soft cloth or cotton wool 
to  clean  them.  If  this  does  not  clean 
them  properly,  moisten  the  cloth  with 
soapy water, then wipe clean with a soft 
damp cloth or cotton wool.
Finally, carefully dry off with a soft dry 
cloth.
Do not use cleaning products con-
taining  alcohol  or  utensils  (e.g.:  a 
scraper).

4.15

INTERIOR TRIM MAINTENANCE (1/2)
A  well-maintained  vehicle  will  last 
longer. It is therefore recommended to 
maintain the interior of the vehicle regu-
larly.
A  stain  should  always  be  dealt  with 
swiftly.
Whatever type of stain is on the trim, 
use cold (or warm) soapy water with 
natural soap.
Detergents (washing-up liquid, pow-
dered products, alcohol-based prod-
ucts) should not be used.
Use a soft cloth.
Rinse and soak up the excess.

Glass instrument panel
(e.g.  instrument  panel,  clock,  exterior 
temperature display, radio display, etc.)
Use a soft cloth (or cotton wool).
If  this  does  not  clean  them  properly, 
use a soft cloth (or cotton wool) slightly 
moistened with soapy water and then 
wipe clean with another soft damp cloth 
or cotton wool.
Finally, carefully dry off with a soft dry 
cloth.
Do not use products containing alco-
hol and/or spray fluids on the area.

Seat belts
These must be kept clean.
Use products selected by our Technical 
Department  (Approved  outlets)  or 
warm, soapy water and a sponge and 
wipe with a dry cloth.
Detergents or dyes must not be used 
under any circumstances.

4.16

Textiles (seats, door trim, etc)
Vacuum-clean the textiles regularly.
Liquid stain
Use soapy water.
Dab lightly (never rub) with a soft cloth, 
rinse and remove the excess.
Solid or pasty stain
Carefully  remove  the  excess  solid  or 
pasty  material  immediately  with  a 
spatula (working from the edges to the 
centre to avoid spreading the stain).
Clean as for a liquid stain.
Special instructions for sweets or 
chewing gum
Put an ice cube on the stain to solidify 
it, then proceed as for a solid stain.

For  further  recommendations  for 
maintaining  the  interior,  and/or  for 
any  unsatisfactory  results,  please 
see an authorised dealer.

INTERIOR TRIM MAINTENANCE (2/2)
Removal/replacing removable 
equipment originally fitted in 
the vehicle
If  you  need  to  remove  equipment  in 
order  to  clean  the  passenger  com-
partment (for example, mats), always 
ensure  that  they  are  correctly  refitted 
and are the right way around (the driv-
er’s mat should be fitted on the driver’s 
side, etc.) and fit them with the compo-
nents supplied with the equipment (for 
example, the driver mat should always 
be fixed using the pre-fitted mounting 
components).
With  the  vehicle  stationary,  always 
ensure that nothing will impede driving 
(anything obstructing the pedals, heel 
wedged by the mat etc.).

You should not:
Position  objects  such  as  deodorants, 
scents etc. near air vents as this could 
damage your dashboard trim.

Use  high-pressure 
cleaning  equipment  or 
sprays  inside  the  pas-
senger compartment: 

without  careful  use,  this  equipment 
could  impair  the  correct  functioning 
of the electrical or electronic compo-
nents  in  the  vehicle,  or  have  other 
detrimental effects.

PUNCTURE, EMERGENCY SPARE WHEEL (1/2)
In case of puncture
Depending on the vehicle, a tyre infla-
tion  kit  or  emergency  spare  wheel  is 
provided (refer to the following pages).
Vehicle  fitted  with  a  tyre  pressure 
loss warning system
If  under-inflated  (puncture,  low  pres-
sure etc.), the warning light  on 
the  instrument  panel  comes  on.  See 
“Tyre  pressure 
in 
Section 2.

loss  warning” 

If the emergency spare wheel has been stored for several years, have it 
checked by your Dealer to ensure that it is safe to use.
Vehicle fitted with an emergency spare wheel that differs from the 
other wheels:

–  Never fit more than one emergency spare wheel to the same vehicle.
–  Replace the emergency spare wheel as soon as possible with a wheel identi-

cal to the original one.

–  When this is fitted to the vehicle, which must only be a temporary measure, the 
driving speed must not exceed the speed indicated on the label on the wheel.
–  Fitting an emergency spare wheel may alter the way the vehicle usually runs. 
Avoid sudden acceleration or deceleration and reduce your speed when cor-
nering.

–  If you need to use snow chains, fit the emergency spare wheel to the rear axle 
and check the tyre pressure.
–  The warning light  on the instrument panel flashes for several seconds, 
then stays on.

If the vehicle is parked on 
the hard shoulder, you must 
warn  other  road  users  of 
your  vehicle’s  presence 
with a warning triangle or with other 
devices as per the legislation apply-
ing to the country you are in.

5.3

Do  not  attempt  to  use  the 
inflation  kit  if  the  tyre  has 
been damaged as a result 
of driving with a puncture.

You should therefore carefully check 
the  condition  of  the  tyre  sidewalls 
before any operation.
Driving  with  underinflated,  flat  or 
punctured tyres can be dangerous 
and may make the tyre impossible 
to repair.
This repair is temporary.
A  tyre  which  has  been  punctured 
should always be inspected (and re-
paired, where possible) as soon as 
possible by a specialist.
When taking a tyre which has been 
repaired using this kit to be replaced, 
you must inform the specialist.
When driving, vibration may be felt 
due  to  the  presence  of  the  repair 
product injected into the tyre.

The kit is only approved for 
inflating the tyres of the ve-
hicle  originally  equipped 
with the kit.

It  must  never  be  used  to  inflate 
the tyres of another vehicle, or any 
other inflatable object (rubber ring, 
rubber boat, etc.).
Avoid  spillage  on  skin  when  han-
dling  the  repair  product  bottle.  If 
droplets do leak out, rinse them off 
with plenty of water.

TYRE PRESSURE KIT (1/3)

B

A

The  kit  repairs  tyres  when 
tread A  has  been  dam-
aged  by  objects  smaller 
than 4 mm. It cannot repair 
all types of puncture, such as cuts 
larger  than  4  mm,  or  cuts  in  tyre 
sidewall B.
Ensure also that the wheel rim is in 
good condition.
Do  not  pull  out  the  foreign  body 
causing the puncture if it is still in 
the tyre.

TYRE PRESSURE KIT (2/3)

2

1

Depending on the vehicle, in the event 
of a puncture, use the kit located in the 
boot or underneath the luggage com-
partment carpet.
Vehicle  fitted  with  a  tyre  pressure 
loss warning system
If  under-inflated  (puncture,  low  pres-
sure,  etc.),  the  warning  light  
lights  up  on  the  instrument  panel. 
See  “Tyre  pressure  loss  warning”  in 
Section 2.

With  the  engine  running  and  the 
parking brake applied,
–  Disconnect  any  accessories  previ-
ously connected to the vehicle’s ac-
cessories sockets;

–  Refer  to  the  information  on  the  in-
flation kit compressor located in the 
vehicle’s luggage compartment and 
follow the instructions;

–  inflate the tyre to the recommended 
pressure  (please  refer  to  the  infor-
mation in the section on “Tyre pres-
sures”);

–  after a maximum of 15 minutes, stop 
inflating and read the pressure (on 
the pressure gauge 1);
Note:  while  the  bottle  is  emptying 
(approximately  30  seconds),  the 
pressure gauge 1 will indicate briefly 
a pressure of 6 bar, then the pres-
sure drops.

–  Adjust  the  pressure:  to  increase 
it, continue inflation with the kit. To 
reduce it, press the button 2.

Before  using  this  kit,  park 
the  vehicle  at  a  sufficient 
distance from traffic, switch 
on  the  hazard  warning 
lights, apply the handbrake, ask all 
passengers to leave the vehicle and 
keep them away from traffic.

If the vehicle is parked on 
the hard shoulder, you must 
warn  other  road  users  of 
your  vehicle’s  presence 
with a warning triangle or with other 
devices as per the legislation apply-
ing to the country you are in.

5.5

TYRE PRESSURE KIT (3/3)

3

If a minimum pressure of 1.8 bar is 
not reached after 15 minutes, repair 
is not possible; do not drive the ve-
hicle but contact an approved dealer.

Nothing  should  be  placed 
around  the  driver’s  feet 
as  such  objects  may  slide 
under  the  pedals  during 
sudden  braking  manoeuvres  and 
obstruct their use.

5.6

Once  the  tyre  is  correctly  inflated, 
remove the kit: slowly unscrew the in-
flation end piece 3 to prevent any prod-
uct spatter and store the container in 
plastic  packaging  to  prevent  product 
leaks.
–  Affix  the  driving  recommendation 
label to the dashboard where it can 
easily be seen by the driver;

–  Put the kit away.
–  At the end of this initial inflation op-
eration, air will still escape from the 
tyre. You must drive a short distance 
in order to seal the hole.

–  Start immediately and drive at 

between 12 and 40 mph (20 and 
60 km/h) in order to distribute the 
product evenly in the tyre and, after 
driving for 2 miles (3 km), stop and 
check the pressure.

–  If the pressure is greater than 

1.3 bar but less than the recom-
mended pressure (refer to the label 
affixed to the edge of the driver’s 
door), readjust it. Otherwise, please 
contact an authorised dealer: the 
tyre cannot be repaired.

Precautions when using the 
kit
The kit should not be operated for more 
than 15 consecutive minutes.

Please  be  aware  that  a 
poorly  tightened  or  miss-
ing valve cap can make the 
tyres less airtight and may 

lead to pressure loss.
Always use valve caps identical to 
those  fitted  originally  and  tighten 
them fully.

Following repair with the kit, 
do  not  travel  further  than 
120 miles (200 km). In addi-
tion, reduce your speed and 
under  no  circumstances  exceed 
48  mph  (80  km/h).  The  sticker, 
which you must affix in a prominent 
position on the dashboard, reminds 
you of this.
Depending on the country or local 
legislation, a tyre repaired with the 
inflation kit may need to be replaced.

Do not leave the tools un-
secured  inside  the  vehicle 
as  they  may  come  loose 
under  braking.  After  use, 
check that all the tools are correctly 
clipped into the tool kit, then posi-
tion it correctly in its housing: risk of 
injury.
If  wheel  bolts  are  supplied  in  the 
tool kit, only use these bolts for the 
emergency spare wheel: refer to the 
label affixed to the emergency spare 
wheel.
The  jack  is  designed  for  wheel 
changing purposes only. Under no 
circumstances should it be used for 
carrying out repairs underneath the 
vehicle or to gain access to the un-
derside of the vehicle.

TYRES (1/3)
Tyre and wheel safety
The tyres are the only contact between 
the vehicle and the road, so it is essen-
tial to keep them in good condition. You 
must  make  sure  that  your  tyres  con- 
form to local road traffic regulations.

2

1

When  the  tyre  tread  has  been  worn 
to the level of the warning strips, they 
become  visible  2:  it  is  then  neces-
sary to replace your tyres because the 
tread rubber is now only 1.6 mm deep 
at most, resulting in poor road hold-
ing on wet roads.
An  overloaded  vehicle,  long  journeys 
by  motorway,  particularly  in  very  hot 
weather, or continual driving on poorly 
surfaced minor roads will lead to more 
rapid tyre wear and affect safety.

Maintaining the tyres
The  tyres  must  be  in  good  condition 
and the tread form must have sufficient 
depth; tyres approved by our Technical 
Department have wear warning strips 
1 which are indicators moulded into 
the tread at several points.

Incidents which occur when 
driving, such as striking the 
kerb, may damage the tyres 
and wheel rims, and could 
also  lead  to  misalignment  of  the 
front or rear axle geometry. In this 
case,  have  the  condition  of  these 
checked by an approved dealer.

5.11

loss  warning” 

Emergency spare wheel
Refer  to  the  information  on  the 
“Emergency  spare  wheel”  and  in-
structions  on  “Changing  a  wheel”  in 
Section 5.

Changing wheels around
This practice is not recommended.

TYRES (2/3)
Tyre pressures
Adhere to the tyre pressures (including 
the emergency spare wheel). The tyre 
pressures should be checked at least 
once a month and additionally before 
any long journey (refer to the label af-
fixed to the edge of the driver’s door).

Pressures should be checked when the 
tyres are cold; ignore higher pressures 
which may be reached in hot weather 
or following a fast journey.
If  tyre  pressures  cannot  be  checked 
when the tyres are cold, assume an in-
crease of 0.2 to 0.3 bar (or 3 PSI).
Never deflate a hot tyre.

Incorrect  tyre  pressures 
lead to abnormal tyre wear 
and unusually hot running. 
These  are  factors  which 
may seriously affect safety and lead 
to:
–  poor road holding,
–  risk of bursting or tread separa-

tion.

The pressure depends on the load 
and  the  speed  of  use.  Adjust  the 
pressure  according  to  the  condi-
tions of use (refer to the label affixed 
to the edge of the driver’s door).

5.12

Please  be  aware  that  a 
poorly  tightened  or  miss-
ing valve cap can make the 
tyres less airtight and lead 

to pressure loss.
Always use valve caps identical to 
those  fitted  originally  and  tighten 
them fully.

TYRES (3/3)
Fitting new tyres

For your safety, please re-
spect the speed limit.
When  they  need  to  be  re-
placed,  only  tyres  of  the 
same make, size, type and profile 
should be used on a single axle.
They must: either have a load ca-
pacity  and  a  speed  capacity  at 
least equal to the original tyres, 
or  correspond  to  those  recom-
mended  by  your  authorised 
dealer.
Failure  to  heed  these  instructions 
could  endanger  your  safety  and 
affect  your  vehicle’s  roadworthi-
ness.
Risk of loss of control of the ve-
hicle.

Use in winter
Chains
For  safety  reasons,  fitting  snow 
chains to the rear axle is strictly for-
bidden.
Chains cannot be fitted to tyres which 
are larger than those originally fitted to 
the vehicle.

Chains  may  only  be  fitted 
to  tyres  of  the  same  size 
as those originally fitted to 
your vehicle.

17”  wheels  cannot  be 
fitted with chains.
If  you  wish  to  fit  snow 
chains, you must use spe-

cial equipment.
Consult an approved Dealer.

Snow or Winter tyres
We  would  recommend  that  these  be 
fitted to all four wheels to ensure that 
your  vehicle  retains  maximum  adhe-
sion.
Warning: These tyres sometimes have 
a  specific  direction  of  rotation  and  a 
maximum speed index which may be 
lower than the maximum speed of your 
vehicle.
Studded tyres
This  type  of  equipment  may  only  be 
used  for  a  limited  period  and  as  laid 
down by local legislation. It is neces-
sary to observe the speed specified by 
current legislation.
These  tyres  must,  at  a  minimum,  be 
fitted to the two front wheels.

In all cases, we would recommend 
that you contact an approved dealer 
who  will  be  able  to  advise  you  on 
the  choice  of  equipment  which  is 
most suitable for your vehicle.

5.28

Do  not  throw  away  your 
used batteries; give them to 
an organisation responsible 
for collecting and recycling 

batteries.

Connecting a battery charger
The  battery  charger  must  be  com-
patible with a battery with nominal 
voltage of 12 volts.
Do not disconnect the battery when the 
engine is running. Follow the instruc-
tions given by the manufacturer of 
the battery charger you are using.

BATTERY: breakdown recovery (1/2)
To avoid all risk of sparks:
–  Ensure that any electrical consumers 
(courtesy  lights,  etc.)  are  switched 
off  before  disconnecting  or  recon-
necting the battery.

–  When  charging,  stop  the  charger 
before connecting or disconnecting 
the battery.

–  Do  not  place  metal  objects  on  the 
battery to avoid creating a short cir-
cuit between the terminals.

–  Always wait at least one minute after 
the  engine  has  been  switched  off 
before disconnecting a battery.

–  Make  sure  that  you  reconnect  the 

battery terminals after refitting.

Before  performing  any 
action  in  the  engine  com-
partment, the ignition must 
be switched off by pressing 
the engine stop button (please see 
the  information  on  “Starting,  stop-
ping the engine” in Section 2).

Special procedures may be 
required  to  charge  some 
batteries. Contact your ap-
proved dealer.

Avoid all risk of sparks which may 
cause an immediate explosion, and 
charge  the  battery  in  a  well-venti-
lated area. Risk of serious injury.

Handle the battery with care 
as it contains sulphuric acid, 
which  must  not  come  into 
contact with eyes or skin. If 
it does, wash the affected area with 
plenty  of  cold  water.  If  necessary, 
consult a doctor.
Ensure that naked flames, red hot 
objects and sparks do not come into 
contact with the battery as there is a 
risk of explosion.
The engine may be hot when car-
rying out operations in close prox-
imity. In addition, the engine cooling 
fan can come on at any moment.
Risk of injury.

5.29

BATTERY: breakdown recovery (2/2)
Starting the vehicle using the 
battery from another vehicle
If you have to use the battery from an-
other  vehicle  to  start,  obtain  suitable 
jump leads (with a large cross section) 
from an approved dealer or, if you al-
ready  have  jump  leads,  ensure  that 
they are in perfect condition.
The two batteries must have an iden-
tical nominal voltage of 12 volts. The 
battery  supplying  the  current  should 
have a capacity (amp-hours, Ah) which 
is at least the same as that of the dis-
charged battery.
Ensure that there is no risk of contact 
between the two vehicles (risk of short 
circuiting  when  the  positive  terminals 
are connected) and that the discharged 
battery  is  properly  connected.  Switch 
off your vehicle ignition.

ACCESSORIES

Electrical and electronic accessories
Before installing this type of accessory (particularly for transmitters/receivers: frequency bandwidth, power level, po-
sition of the aerial, etc.), make sure it is compatible with your vehicle. You can get advice from an authorised dealer.
Connect accessories with a maximum power of 120 Watts only. Fire hazard. When several accessory sockets are 

used at the same time, the total power of the connected accessories must not exceed 180 watts.
No work may be carried out on the vehicle’s electrical or radio circuits, except by authorised dealers: an incorrectly connected 
system may result in damage being caused to the electrical equipment and/or the components connected to it.
If the vehicle is fitted with any aftermarket electrical equipment, make sure that the installation is correctly protected by a fuse. 
Establish the rating and position of this fuse.
Using the diagnostic socket
The use of electronic accessories on the diagnostic socket may cause serious disturbance to the vehicle’s electronic systems. 
For your safety we recommend that you use only electronic accessories approved by the manufacturer, consult an Approved 
Dealer. Serious accident risk.
Use of transmitting/receiving devices (telephones, CB equipment etc.).
Telephones and CB equipment with integrated aerials may cause interference to the electronic systems originally fitted to the 
vehicle: it is advisable only to use equipment with an external aerial. Furthermore, we remind you of the need to conform 
to the legislation in force concerning the use of such equipment.
Fitting aftermarket accessories
If you wish to install accessories on the vehicle: please contact an authorised dealer. Also, to ensure the correct operation of 
your vehicle, and to avoid any risk to your safety, we recommend that you use only accessories specifically designed for your 
vehicle, which are the only accessories for which the manufacturer will provide a warranty.
If you are using an anti-theft device, only attach it to the brake pedal.
Obstructions to the driver
On the driver’s side, only use mats suitable for the vehicle, attached with the pre-fitted components, and check the fitting regu-
larly. Do not lay one mat on top of another. There is a risk of wedging the pedals.

Maximum permissible load on roof
* Towing weight (towing a caravan, boat, etc.)
Towing is prohibited when the MTR - MMAC calculation is equal to zero, or when the MTR is equal to zero (or is not listed) on 
the identification plate.
–  It is important to comply with the towing weights, governed by local legislation in each country and, in particular, laid down in 

80 kg (including carrying device)

the Road Traffic Regulations. Contact an approved Dealer about any towing equipment.

–  When towing, under no circumstances may the total train weight (vehicle + trailer) be exceeded. However the following is 

permitted:
–  rear axle MMTA exceeded by no more than 15%,
–  maximum MMAC exceeded by no more than 10% or 100 kg (whichever is reached first).
In either case, the maximum speed of the vehicle and trailer must not exceed 60 mph (100 km/h) and the tyre pressures must 
be increased by 0.2 bar (3 PSI).

–  The engine output and climbing capability are reduced with altitude. We recommend that the maximum load be reduced by 

 

10% at an altitude of 1,000 metres and by an additional 10% for each 1,000 metres thereafter.

Weight transfer (except utility version)
Depending on the local legislation, if the Maximum Authorised Mass of the vehicle has not been reached, up to 300 kg can be 
transferred to the braked trailer, within the limits of the Gross Train Weight.

REPLACEMENT PARTS AND REPAIRS
Original parts are based on strict specifications and are subject to highly-specialised tests. Therefore, they are of at least the same 
level of quality as the parts fitted originally.
If you always fit genuine replacement parts to your vehicle, you will ensure that it performs well. Furthermore, repairs carried out 
within the manufacturer’s Network using original parts are guaranteed according to the conditions set out on the reverse of the 
repair order.
