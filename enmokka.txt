Seat belts

The seat belts are locked during
heavy acceleration or deceleration of
the vehicle holding the occupants in
the sitting position. Therefore the risk
of injury is considerably reduced.

9 Warning

Fasten seat belt before each trip.
In the event of an accident, people
not wearing seat belts endanger
their fellow occupants and
themselves.

Seat belts are designed to be used by
only one person at a time. Child

Periodically check all parts of the belt
system for damage and proper
functionality.
Have damaged components
replaced. After an accident, have the
belts and triggered belt pretensioners
replaced by a workshop.
Note
Make sure that the belts are not
damaged by shoes or sharp-edged
objects or trapped. Prevent dirt from
getting into the belt retractors.
Seat belt reminder X 3 84.
Belt force limiters
On the front seats, stress on the body
is reduced by the gradual release of
the belt during a collision.
Belt pretensioners
In the event of a head-on or rear-end
collision of a certain severity, the front
seat belts are tightened.

9 Warning

Incorrect handling (e.g. removal or
fitting of belts) can trigger the belt
pretensioners.

Deployment of the belt pretensioners
is indicated by continuous illumination
of control indicator v 3 84.
Triggered belt pretensioners must be
replaced by a workshop. Belt
pretensioners can only be triggered
once.

front passenger side. These can be
identified by the word AIRBAG.
The front airbag system is triggered in
the event of a front-end impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and head of
the front seat occupants
considerably.

Curtain airbag system
The curtain airbag system consists of
an airbag in the roof frame on each
side. This can be identified by the
word AIRBAG on the roof pillars.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and pelvis in
the event of a side-on collision
considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Note
Only use protective seat covers that
have been approved for the vehicle.
Be careful not to cover the airbags.

The curtain airbag system is triggered
in the event of a side-on impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of

Airbag deactivation
The front passenger airbag system
must be deactivated if a child restraint
system is to be fitted on this seat. The
side airbag and curtain airbag
systems, the belt pretensioners and
all driver airbag systems will remain
active.

Use the ignition key to choose the
position:
c : front passenger airbags are

deactivated and will not inflate
in the event of a collision.
Control indicator c
illuminates continuously in the
centre console. A child
restraint system can be
installed in accordance with

active. A child restraint system
must not be installed.

The front passenger airbag system
can be deactivated via a key-
operated switch on the right side of
the instrument panel.

9 Danger

Risk of fatal injury for a child using
a child restraint system on a seat
with activated front passenger
airbag.
Risk of fatal injury for an adult
person on a seat with deactivated
front passenger airbag.

As long as the control indicator c is
not illuminated, the front passenger

When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.
Note
Do not affix anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.
A child restraint system which has
been subjected to stress in an
accident must be replaced.

Child restraints
Child restraint systems
We recommend the Opel child
restraint system which is tailored
specifically to the vehicle.
When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.
Always comply with local or national
regulations. In some countries, the
use of child restraint systems is
forbidden on certain seats.

9 Warning

When using a child restraint
system on the front passenger
seat, the airbag systems for the
front passenger seat must be
deactivated; if not, the triggering of
the airbags poses a risk of fatal
injury to the child.
This is especially the case if rear-
facing child restraint systems are
used on the front passenger seat.

Airbag deactivation 3 48.
Airbag label 3 43.
Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This ensures that the child's
backbone, which is still very weak, is
under less strain in the event of an
accident.
Suitable are restraint systems that
comply with valid UN ECE
regulations. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.
Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct, see following
tables.
Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.

luggage (7 kg) and all fluids (fuel
tank 90% full).
Optional equipment and
accessories increase the kerb
weight.

● Driving with a roof load increases

the sensitivity of the vehicle to
cross-winds and has a
detrimental effect on vehicle
handling due to the vehicle’s
higher centre of gravity.
Distribute the load evenly and
secure it properly with retaining
straps. Adjust the tyre pressure
and vehicle speed according to
the load conditions. Check and
retighten the straps frequently.
Do not drive faster than
120 km/h.

● The permissible roof load is
75 kg. The roof load is the
combined weight of the roof rack
and the load.

● The load must not obstruct the
operation of the pedals, parking
brake and gear selector, or
hinder the freedom of movement
of the driver. Do not place any
unsecured objects in the interior.

● Do not drive with an open load

compartment.

9 Warning

Always make sure that the load in
the vehicle is securely stowed.
Otherwise objects can be thrown
around inside the vehicle and
cause personal injury or damage
to the load or vehicle.

Driving hints
Control of the vehicle
Never coast with engine not
running (except during Autostop)
Many systems will not function in this
situation (e.g. brake servo unit, power
steering). Driving in this manner is a
danger to yourself and others. All
systems function during an Autostop,
but there will be a controlled reduction
in power steering assist and vehicle
speed is reduced.
Stop-start system 3 128.
Pedals
To ensure the pedal travel is
uninhibited, there must be no mats in
the area of the pedals.
Use only floor mats, which fit properly
and are fixed by the retainers on the
driver side.

Steering
If power steering assist is lost
because the engine stops or due to a
system malfunction, the vehicle can
be steered but may require increased
effort.
Control indicator c 3 86.

Caution

Vehicles equipped with hydraulic
power steering:
If the steering wheel is turned until
it reaches the end of its travel, and
is held in that position for more
than 10 seconds, damage may
occur to the power steering
system and there may be loss of
power steering assist.

Starting and operating
New vehicle running-in
Do not brake unnecessarily hard for
the first few journeys.
During the first drive, smoke may
occur because of wax and oil
evaporating off the exhaust system.
Park the vehicle in the open for a
while after the first drive and avoid
inhaling the fumes.
During the running-in period fuel and
engine oil consumption may be
higher and the cleaning process of
the diesel particle filter may take
place more often. Autostop may be
inhibited to allow for charging the
battery.

after a short delay.
Possible reasons for a non-starting
engine:
● clutch pedal not operated

(manual transmission)

● brake pedal not operated or
selector lever not in P or N
(automatic transmission)

● timeout occurred
Turbo engine warm-up
Upon start-up, engine available
torque may be limited for a short time,
especially when the engine
temperature is cold. The limitation is
to allow the lubrication system to fully
protect the engine.

Overrun cut-off
The fuel supply is automatically cut off
during overrun, i.e. when the vehicle
is driven with a gear engaged but
accelerator is released.

Stop-start system
The stop-start system helps to save
fuel and to reduce the exhaust
emissions. When conditions allow, it
switches off the engine as soon as the
vehicle is at a low speed or at a
standstill, e.g. at a traffic light or in a
traffic jam. It starts the engine
automatically as soon as the clutch is
depressed. A battery sensor ensures
that an Autostop is only performed if
the battery is sufficiently charged for
a restart.
Activation
The stop-start system is available as
soon as the engine is started, the
vehicle starts-off and the conditions
as stated below in this section are
fulfilled.

Deactivation

Deactivate the stop-start system
manually by pressing Ï.
Deactivation is indicated when the
LED in the button extinguishes.
Autostop
If the vehicle is at a low speed or at a
standstill, activate an Autostop as
follows:
● Depress the clutch pedal.
● Set the lever in neutral.
● Release the clutch pedal.
The engine will be switched off while
the ignition stays on.

● The battery is sufficiently

charged and in good condition.

● The engine is warmed up.
● The engine coolant temperature

is not too high.

● The engine exhaust temperature
is not too high, e.g. after driving
with high engine load.

● The ambient temperature is not

too low.

● The climate control system

allows an Autostop.

● The brake vacuum is sufficient.
● The self-cleaning function of the
diesel particle filter is not active.
● The vehicle has moved since the

last Autostop.

Otherwise an Autostop will be
inhibited.
Ambient temperature near to the
freezing point can inhibit an Autostop.
Certain settings of the climate control
system may inhibit an Autostop. See
'Climate control' chapter for more
details.
Immediately after motorway driving
an Autostop may be inhibited.

Engine exhaust

9 Danger

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases. The system includes
a self-cleaning function that runs
automatically during driving without
any notification. The filter is cleaned
by periodically burning off the soot
particles at high temperature. This
process takes place automatically
under set driving conditions and may
take up to 25 minutes. Typically it

131

Driving and operating
needs between 7 and 12 minutes.
Autostop is not available and fuel
consumption may be higher during
this period. The emission of smells
and smoke during this process is
normal.

Under certain driving conditions, e.g.
short distances, the system cannot
clean itself automatically.
If cleaning of the filter is required and
if previous driving conditions did not
enable automatic cleaning, it will be
indicated by control indicator %.
% illuminates when diesel particle
filter is full. Start cleaning process as
soon as possible.

Driving and operating

level. Start cleaning process
immediately to avoid damage to the
engine.
Cleaning process
To activate cleaning process,
continue driving, keep engine speed
above 2000 revolutions per minute.
Shift down if necessary. Diesel
particle filter cleaning is then started.
If control indicator g also
illuminates, cleaning is not possible:
seek the assistance of a workshop.

Caution

Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the
amount of harmful substances in the
exhaust gases.

Caution

Fuel grades other than those listed
on pages 3 153, 3 214 could
damage the catalytic converter or
electronic components.
Unburnt petrol will overheat and
damage the catalytic converter.
Therefore avoid excessive use of
the starter, running the fuel tank
dry and starting the engine by
pushing or towing.

If the cleaning process is
interrupted, there is a risk of
provoking severe engine damage.

Cleaning takes place quickest at high
engine speeds and loads.
The control indicator % extinguishes
as soon as the self-cleaning
operation is complete.

In the event of misfiring, uneven
engine running, a reduction in engine
performance or other unusual
problems, have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop as soon as
possible. In an emergency, driving
can be continued for a short period,
keeping vehicle speed and engine

Drive systems
All-wheel drive
The All-Wheel Drive (AWD) system
enhances driving characteristics and
stability, and helps to achieve the best
possible driveability regardless of
ground surface. The system is always
active and cannot be deactivated.
The torque is distributed steplessly
between the wheels of the front and
rear axle, depending on the driving
conditions. Additionally the torque
between the rear wheels is distributed
depending on the surface.
For optimum system performance,
the vehicle's tyres should not have
varying degrees of wear.
When using a temporary spare
wheel, the AWD system is
automatically disabled.
The AWD system will also be
temporarily disabled to protect the
system from overheating if there is
excessive wheel spin. When the
system cools down, AWD will be
restored.

Driving and operating
Fault

137

9 Warning

If there is a fault in the ABS, the
wheels may be liable to lock due
to braking that is heavier than
normal. The advantages of ABS
are no longer available. During
hard braking, the vehicle can no
longer be steered and may
swerve.

Have the cause of the fault remedied
by a workshop.

Parking brake

ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting-off the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.
Control indicator u 3 85.
Adaptive brake light
During full braking, all three brake
lights flash for the duration of ABS
control.

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing the journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
Control indicator R 3 85.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.

brake force is automatically applied
(full braking).
Maintain steady pressure on the
brake pedal for as long as full braking
is required. Maximum brake force is
automatically reduced when the
brake pedal is released.

Hill start assist
The system helps prevent unintended
movement when driving away on
inclines.
When releasing the brake pedal after
stopping on an incline, the brakes
remain on for a further two seconds.
The brakes release automatically as
soon as the vehicle begins to
accelerate.
The hill start assist is not active during
an Autostop.
Stop-start system 3 128.

Ride control systems
Traction Control system
The Traction Control system (TC) is a
component of the Electronic Stability
Control (ESC) 3 139.
TC improves driving stability when
necessary, regardless of the type of
road surface or tyre grip, by
preventing the drive wheels from
spinning.
As soon as the drive wheels starts to
spin, engine output is reduced and
the wheel spinning the most is braked
individually. This considerably
improves the driving stability of the
vehicle on slippery road surfaces.
TC is operational after each engine

direct sunlight or shadows

The system can not operate when no
lane marking is detected.

Fuel
Fuel for petrol engines
Only use unleaded fuel that complies
with European standard EN 228 or
E DIN 51626-1 or equivalent.
The engine is capable of running with
fuel that contains up to 10% ethanol
(e.g. named E10).
Use fuel with the recommended
octane rating 3 214.

Caution

Do not use fuel or fuel additives
that contain metallic compounds
such as manganese-based
additives. This may cause engine
damage.

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 228 or E DIN 51626-1 or
equivalent can lead to deposits or
engine damage.

153

Caution

Use of fuel with too low an octane
rating could lead to uncontrolled
combustion and engine damage.
Fuel for diesel engines
Only use diesel fuel that complies
with EN 590.
In countries outside the European
Union use Euro-Diesel fuel with a
sulphur concentration below 50 ppm.

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 590 or similar can lead to
engine powerloss, increased wear
or engine damage.

Do not use marine diesel oils, heating

Driving and operating
Fuel for liquid gas operation
Liquid gas is known as LPG
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas) or under
its French name GPL (Gaz de Pétrole
Liquéfié). LPG is also known as
Autogas.
LPG consists mainly of propane and
butane. The octane rating is between
105 and 115, depending on the
butane proportion. LPG is stored
liquid at around five to ten bar
pressure.
The boiling point depends on the
pressure and mixing ratio. At ambient
pressure, it is between -42 °C (pure
propane) and -0.5 °C (pure butane).

Caution

The system works at an ambient
temperature of approx. -8 °C to
100 °C.

Full function of the LPG system can
only be guaranteed with liquid gas
which complies with the minimum
requirements of DIN EN 589.

Fuel selector

The selected fuel mode is stored and
reactivated at the next ignition cycle if
conditions allow.
As soon as the liquid gas tanks are
empty, petrol operation is
automatically engaged until the
ignition is switched off.
Every six months, run the petrol tank
down until control indicator i
illuminates, then refuel. This helps
maintain fuel quality and system
function for petrol operation.

Fill the tank completely at regular
intervals to prevent corrosion in the
tank.
Faults and remedies
If gas mode is not possible, check the
following:
● Is there enough liquid gas

present?

● Is there enough petrol present for

starting?

Due to extreme temperatures in
combination with the gas
composition, it may take slightly
longer before the system switches
from petrol to gas mode.
In extreme situations, the system may
also switch back to petrol mode if the
minimum requirements are not
fulfilled. If conditions allow, it might be
possible to manually switch back to
liquid gas operation.
Seek the assistance of a workshop in
the event of all other faults.

Caution

Repairs and adjustments may only
be made by trained specialists in
order to maintain the safety and
warranty on the LPG system.

Liquid gas is given a particular odour
(odorised) so that any leaks can be
detected easily.

9 Warning

If you smell gas in the vehicle or in
the immediate vicinity, switch to
petrol mode immediately. No
smoking. No naked flames or
ignition sources.

If the gas odour persists, do not start
the engine. Have the cause of the
fault remedied by a workshop.

Trailer hitch
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.
The bulb outage detection function for
trailer brake light cannot detect a
partial bulb outage, e.g. in case of four
times five watt bulbs, the function only
detects lamp outage when only a
single five Watt lamp remains or none
remain.
Fitting of towing equipment could
cover the opening of the towing eye.
If this is the case, use the coupling ball
bar for towing. Always keep the
coupling ball bar in the vehicle when
not in use.

Driving and operating
Driving characteristics and
towing tips
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements.
For trailers with low driving stability
and caravan trailers with a permitted
gross vehicle weight of more than
1000 kg a speed of 80 km/h must not
be exceeded; the use of a stabiliser is
recommended.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 219.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to max. 12%.
The permitted trailer loads apply up to
the specified incline and up to an
altitude of 1000 metres above sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10%
for every 1000 metres of additional
altitude. The gross train weight does
not have to be reduced when driving
on roads with slight inclines (less than
8%, e.g. motorways).

The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 209.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (75 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.
Rear axle load
The permissible axle loads (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) must not be exceeded.

Wheels and tyres

185

Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
Tyre size 215/60 R17, 215/55 R18
and 225/45 R19 are only to be used
as winter tyres.
In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the speed sticker in
the driver's field of view.

W : up to 270 km/h
Choose a tyre appropiate for the
maximum speed of your verhicle.
The maximum speed is achievable at
kerb weight with driver (75 kg) plus
125 kg payload. Optional equipment
could reduce the maximum speed of
the vehicle.
Performance 3 215.

Directional tyres
Fit directional tyres such that they roll
in the direction of travel. The rolling
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel. This also applies to vehicles
with tyre pressure monitoring system.
Unscrew the valve cap.

Tyre pressure 3 219.

The tyre pressure information label
on the left or right door frame
indicates the original equipment tyres
and the correspondent tyre
pressures.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.
Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options. For the correct tyre
pressure value, follow the procedure
below:
1. Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 214.

2. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 219.

For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase. Tyre pressure
values provided on the tyre
information label and tyre pressure
chart are valid for cold tyres, which
means at 20 °C.
The pressure increases by nearly
10 kPa for a 10 °C temperature
increase. This must be considered
when warm tyres are checked.

The tyre pressure value displayed in
the Driver Information Centre shows
the real tyre pressure. A cooled down
tyre will show a decreased value,
which does not indicate an air leak.

Tyre pressure monitoring
system
The tyre pressure monitoring system
checks the pressure of all four tyres
once a minute when vehicle speed
exceeds a certain limit.

Caution

Tyre pressure monitoring system
warns only about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

All wheels must be equipped with
pressure sensors and the tyres must
have the prescribed pressure.

Vehicle care

187

Note
In countries where the tyre pressure
monitoring system is legally
required, the use of wheels without
pressure sensors will invalidate the
vehicle type approval.
The current tyre pressures can be
shown in the Vehicle Information
Menu in the Driver Information
Centre.
The menu can be selected by the
buttons on the turn signal lever.

Press MENU to select the Vehicle
Information Menu X.

188

Vehicle care

Turn the adjuster wheel to select the
tyre pressure monitoring system.
System status and pressure warnings
are displayed by a message with the
corresponding tyre flashing in the

The system considers the tyre
temperature for the warnings.
Temperature dependency 3 186.

A detected low tyre pressure
condition is indicated by the control
indicator w 3 87.
If w illuminates, stop as soon as
possible and inflate the tyres as
recommended 3 219.
If w flashes for 60-90 seconds and
then illuminates continuously, there is
a fault in the system. Consult a
workshop.
After inflating, driving may be
required to update the tyre pressure
values in the Driver Information
Centre. During this time w may
illuminate.

If w illuminates at lower temperatures
and extinguishes after some driving,
this could be an indicator for
approaching a low tyre pressure
condition. Check tyre pressure.
Vehicle messages 3 95.
If the tyre pressure shall be reduced
or increased, switch off ignition.
Only mount wheels with pressure
sensors, otherwise the tyre pressure
will not be displayed and w
illuminates continuously.
A temporary spare wheel is not
equipped with pressure sensors. The
tyre pressure monitoring system is
not operational for these wheels.
Control indicator w illuminates. For
the further three wheels the system
remains operational.
The use of commercially available
liquid tyre repair kits can impair the
function of the system. Factory-
approved repair kits can be used.
Operating electronic devices or being
close to facilities using similar wave
frequencies could disrupt the tyre
pressure monitoring system.

Each time the tyres are replaced, tyre
pressure monitoring system sensors
must be dismounted and serviced.
For the screwed sensor, replace
valve core and sealing ring. For
clipped sensor, replace complete
valve stem.
Vehicle loading status
Adjust tyre pressure to load condition
according to tyre information label or
tyre pressure chart 3 219, and select
the relevant setting in the menu Tyre
Load in the Driver Information Centre,
Vehicle Information Menu 3 89. This
setting is the reference for the tyre
pressure warnings.
The Tyre Load menu only appears if
the vehicle is in a standstill and the
parking brake is applied. On vehicles
with automatic transmission the
selector lever has to be in P.

Vehicle care

189

The tyre pressure sensor matching
process should also be performed
after replacing a spare wheel with a
road wheel containing the tyre
pressure sensor.
The malfunction light w and the
warning message or code should go
off at the next ignition cycle. The
sensors are matched to the wheel
positions, using a relearn tool, in the
following order: left side front wheel,
right side front wheel, right side rear
wheel and left side rear wheel. The
turn signal light at the current active
position is illuminated until sensor is
matched.
Consult a workshop for service or
purchase a relearn tool. There are
two minutes to match the first wheel
position, and five minutes overall to
match all four wheel positions. If it
takes longer, the matching process
stops and must be restarted.
The tyre pressure sensor matching
process is:
1. Apply the parking brake.
2. Turn the ignition on.

Select:
● Light for comfort pressure up to

3 people

● Eco for Eco pressure up to

3 people

● Max for full loading
Tyre pressure sensor matching
process
Each tyre pressure sensor has a
unique identification code. The
identification code must be matched
to a new wheel position after rotating
the wheels or exchanging the
complete wheel set and if one or more
tyre pressure sensors were replaced.

13. Turn off the ignition.
14. Set all four tyres to the

recommended air pressure level
as indicated on the tyre pressure
information label.

15. Ensure the tyre loading status is
set according selected pressure
3 89.

Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.

Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons it is recommended
that the tread depth of the tyres on
one axle should not vary by more than
2 mm.

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear
indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.

If there is more wear at the front than
the rear, swap round front wheels and
rear wheels. Ensure that the direction
of rotation of the wheels is the same
as before.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every six years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and make other vehicle
modifications.
After converting to a different tyre
size, have the label with tyre
pressures replaced.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheels
may lead to accidents and will
invalidate the vehicle type
approval.

Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory-approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory-approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.

Vehicles with alloy wheels: When
mounting steel wheels with alloy
wheel nuts, e.g. when changing to
winter tyres, the wheel covers cannot
be attached to the steel wheels.

Vehicle care

191

Tyre chains

Use tyre chains only on front wheels.

9 Warning

Damage may lead to tyre blowout.

Tyre chains are permitted on tyres of
size 205/70 R16, 215/60 R17,
215/55 R18 and 225/45 R19.
Always use fine mesh chains suitable
for sport utility vehicles that add no
more than 12 mm to the tyre tread and
the inboard sides (including chain
lock).

Vehicle care

192
Special snow chains are only
permitted when they are designed
with a rotating chain belt on the tyre
tread, no chain links on the wheel
inboard sides and the chains add no
more than 12 mm to the tyre tread.
For further information regarding
correct snow chain usage for this tyre
size, contact a specialized vehicle
parts dealer or snow chain
manufacturer.
Only use tyre chains on production
tyre that meet the vehicle
specifications.
The use of tyre chains is not permitted
on the temporary spare wheel.

Tyre repair kit
Minor damage to the tyre tread can be
repaired with the tyre repair kit.
Do not remove foreign bodies from
the tyres.
Tyre damage exceeding 4 mm or that
is at tyre's sidewall cannot be repaired
with the tyre repair kit.

9 Warning

Do not drive faster than 80 km/h.
Do not use for a lengthy period.
Steering and handling may be
affected.

tyre.

7. Screw the filler hose to the tyre

valve.

8. The switch on the compressor

must be set to J.

9. Connect the compressor plug to

the power outlet or cigarette
lighter socket.
To avoid discharging the battery,
we recommend running the
engine.

10. Set the rocker switch on the

compressor to I. The tyre is filled
with sealant.

11. The compressor pressure gauge
briefly indicates up to 6 bar whilst
the sealant bottle is emptying
(approx. 30 seconds). Then the
pressure starts to drop.

12. All of the sealant is pumped into
the tyre. Then the tyre is inflated.

13. The prescribed tyre pressure

should be obtained within
ten minutes. Tyre pressure
3 219. When the correct pressure
is obtained, switch off the
compressor.

194

Vehicle care

If the prescribed tyre pressure is
not obtained within ten minutes,
remove the tyre repair kit. Move
the vehicle one tyre rotation.
Reattach the tyre repair kit and
continue the filling procedure for
10 minutes. If the prescribed tyre
pressure is still not obtained, the
tyre is too badly damaged. Seek
the assistance of a workshop.
Drain excess tyre pressure with
the button over the pressure
indicator.
Do not run the compressor longer
than 10 minutes.

14. Detach the tyre repair kit. Push

catch on bracket to remove
sealant bottle from bracket. Screw
the tyre inflation hose to the free

16. Take the label indicating

maximum permitted speed from
the sealant bottle and affix in the
driver's field of view.

17. Continue driving immediately so
that sealant is evenly distributed
in the tyre. After driving approx.
10 km (but no more than
ten minutes), stop and check tyre
pressure. Screw compressor air
hose directly onto tyre valve and
compressor when doing this.

If tyre pressure is more than
1.3 bar, set it to the correct value.
Repeat the procedure until there
is no more loss of pressure.
If the tyre pressure has fallen

Vehicle care

201

Caution

Never tow a vehicle equipped with
All Wheel Drive (AWD) with the
front or rear tyres on the road. If
you tow a vehicle equipped with
AWD while the front or rear tyres
are rolling on the road, the drive
system in the vehicle could be
severely damaged. When towing
vehicles equipped with AWD, all
four tyres must not be in contact
with the road.

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

When the engine is not running,
considerably more force is needed to
brake and steer.
To prevent the entry of exhaust gases
from the towing vehicle, switch on the
air recirculation system 3 119 and
close the windows.

Vehicle care

202
Vehicles with manual transmission:
The vehicle must be towed facing
forwards. The maximum speed is
80 km/h. In all other cases, and when
the transmission is defective, the front
axle must be raised off the ground.
Vehicles with automatic transmission:
Do not tow the vehicle using a towing
eye. Towing with a tow rope could
cause severe automatic transmission
damage. When towing vehicles with
automatic transmission, use flat bed
or wheel lift equipment.
Seek the assistance of a workshop.
After towing, unscrew the towing eye.
Insert cap and close cap.

Towing another vehicle

Disengage the cap by using a
screwdriver and remove.
The towing eye is stowed with the
vehicle tools 3 185.

Screw in the towing eye as far as it will
go until it stops in a horizontal
position.
The lashing eye at the rear
underneath the vehicle must never be
used as a towing eye.
Attach a tow rope – or even better a
tow bar – to the towing eye.
The towing eye must only be used for
towing and not for recovering a
vehicle.

Caution

Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily.
Excessive tractive force can
damage the vehicle.

After towing, unscrew the towing eye.
Insert cap at the bottom and engage
cap.

Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use de-icing agent only when
absolutely necessary, as this has a
degreasing effect and impairs lock
function. After using a de-icing agent,
have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select a programme that
includes waxing.
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.

Vehicle care

203
If using a vehicle wash, comply with
the vehicle wash manufacturer's
instructions. The windscreen wiper
and rear window wiper must be
switched off. Remove antenna and
external accessories such as roof
racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of 4 to 9.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.
Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Vehicle care

204
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.
Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Plastic body parts must not be treated
with wax or polishing agents.

Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with a
soft cloth and window cleaner.
Remove dirt residues from smearing
wiper blades by using a soft cloth and
window cleaner. Also make sure to
remove any residues such as wax,
insect residues and similar from the
window.
Ice residues, pollution and continuous
wiping on dry windows will damage or
even destroy the wiper blades.

Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.

Vehicle care

205
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, e.g. zips,
belts or studded jeans.

Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Liquid gas system

9 Danger

Liquid gas is heavier than air and
can collect in sink points.
Take care when performing work
at the underbody in a pit.

For painting work and when using a
drying booth at a temperature above
60 °C, the liquid gas system must be
completely evacuated.
Do not make any modifications to the
liquid gas system.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Rear carrier system
Clean the rear carrier system with a
steam-jet or high-pressure jet cleaner
at least once a year.

Operate the rear carrier system
periodically if not in regular use, in
particular during winter.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument cluster and the
displays should only be cleaned using
a soft damp cloth. If necessary use a
weak soap solution.
Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-
coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil
aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.

Service and maintenance

207
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
gasoline and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities have to be used.
Recommendations for gasoline
engines are also valid for
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG),
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and
Ethanol (E85) fuelled engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 211.
Topping up engine oil
Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.
Use of engine oil with only
ACEA A1/B1 or only A5/B5 quality is
prohibited, since it can cause long-
term engine damage under certain
operating conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 211.

northern countries with very low
temperatures the factory filled coolant
provides frost protection down to
approx. -37 °C. This concentration
should be maintained all year round.
The use of additional coolant
additives that intend to give additional
corrosion protection or seal against
minor leaks can cause function
problems. Liability for consequences
resulting from the use of additional
coolant additives will be rejected.
Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.

Service and maintenance

208
Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 211.
All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only organic acid type-long life
coolant (LLC) antifreeze approved for
the vehicle. Consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C. In

Collision damage repair
Paint thickness
Due to production, the thickness of
the paint can differ between 50 and
400 µm.
Therefore, different paint thickness is
no indicator for a collision damage
repair.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
● Operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels)
● Status messages of the vehicle
and its single components (e.g.
number of wheel revolutions /
rotational speed, deceleration,
lateral acceleration)

● Dysfunctions and defects in

important system components

● Vehicle reactions in particular

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the
stability regulation system)

● Environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature)

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimizing vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

Customer information

225

When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
