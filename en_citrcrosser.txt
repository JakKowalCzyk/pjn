the driver to suit the circumstances: 
A.  Two wheel drive (2WD),
B.  Four wheel drive (4WD AUTO),
C.  Four wheel drive (4WD LOCK).

  Also... 
You can change transmission mode
when stationary or when driving at a
speed below 60 mph (100 km/h).

This  detects  obstacles  (person,  vehicle,
tree, gate, ...) located behind the vehicle. 
The vehicle is ﬁ tted with four sensors: 
D.   two side sensors. 
E.   two central sensors. 

 This maintains a constant vehicle speed 
programmed by the driver.
1. "ON/OFF"

cruising speed.

3. "ACC  RES"   button:  increasing  the 
cruising  speed  and  recalling  the 
stored speed.

4. "CANCEL"  button: switching off the 

cruise control.

 In order to be programmed or activated, 
the vehicle speed must be higher than 
25 mph (40 km/h) with at least second 
gear engaged.

ECO-DRIVING 
 Eco-driving is a range of everyday practices that allow the motorist to optimise their fuel consumption and CO2 emis-
sions. 
Optimise the use of your 
gearbox
With a manual gearbox, move off gen-
tly,  change  up  without  waiting  and 
drive  by  changing  up  quite  soon.  If 
your vehicle has the system, the gear 
shift indicator invites you to change up; 
it is displayed in the instrument panel, 
follow its instructions.

  Avoid running the engine before mov-
ing off, particularly in winter; your ve-
hicle  will  warm  up  much  faster  while
driving.

  As a passenger, if you avoid connect-
ing your multimedia devices (ﬁ lm, mu-
sic, video game...), you will contribute
towards  limiting  the  consumption  of 
electrical energy, and so of fuel. 
Disconnect your portable devices be-
fore leaving the vehicle.

  Control the use of your 
electrical equipment 
  Before  moving  off,  if  the  passenger 
compartment is too warm, ventilate it
by opening the windows and air vents
before using the air conditioning.
 Above  30  mph  (50  km/h),  close  the
windows  and  leave  the  air  vents
open. 
 Remember to make use of equipment
that  can  help  keep  the  temperature
in  the  passenger  compartment  down
(sun roof and window blinds...). 
 Switch off the air conditioning, unless
it  has  automatic  digital  regulation,  as
soon as the desired temperature is at-
tained.
 Switch  off  the  demisting  and  defrost-
ing controls, if not automatic. 
 Switch off the heated seat as soon as
possible.
  Switch  off  the  headlamps  and  front
foglamps when the level of light does
not require their use.  

With an automatic or electronic gearbox, 
stay in Drive "D"  or Auto  "A", according 
to the type of gearbox, without pressing 
the  accelerator  pedal  heavily  or  sud-
denly.  

Drive smoothly
Maintain  a  safe  distance  between  ve-
hicles, use engine braking rather than 
the brake pedal, and press the accel-
erator  progressively.  These  practices 
contribute  towards  a  reduction  in  fuel 
consumption  and  CO2  emissions  and 
also helps reduce the background traf-
ﬁ c noise.  

22

If  your  vehicle  has  cruise  control, 
make  use  of  the  system  at  speeds 
above  25 mph  (40 km/h)  when  the 
trafﬁ c is ﬂ owing well.   

19 

  Limit the causes of excess 
consumption
  Spread  loads  throughout  the  vehicle;
place the heaviest items in the bottom
of the boot, as close as possible to the
rear seats.
 Limit  the  loads  carried  in  the  vehicle
and reduce wind resistance (roof bars,
roof rack, bicycle carrier, trailer...). Use
a roof box in preference. 
 Remove roof bars and roof racks after 
use.  

  Observe the recommendations 
on maintenance
  Check  the  tyre  pressures  regularly,
when cold, referring to the label in the
door aperture, driver's side. 
 Carry out this check in particular:
   -   before a long journey,
  -   at each change of season,
  -   after a long period out of use.
 Don't  forget  the  spare  wheel  and  the
tyres on any trailer or caravan.  

When refuelling, do not continue after 
the  3 rd   cut-off  of  the  nozzle  to  avoid
any overﬂ ow.

  At the wheel of your new vehicle, it is only
after the ﬁ rst 1 800 miles (3 000 kilometres)
that you will see the fuel consumption set-
tle down to a consistent average.  

  At  the  end  of  winter,  remove  snow
tyres and reﬁ t your summer tyres.

  Have  your  vehicle  serviced  regularly
(engine oil, oil ﬁ lter, air ﬁ lter...) and ob-
serve the schedule of operations rec-
ommended by the manufacturer.

AUTOMATIC REGULATION OF 
THE DIGITAL AIR CONDITIONING 

II

 Use  of  the  automatic  regulation  of  the 
air conditioning is recommended. It per-
mits automatic and optimised control of 
all  of  the  following  functions:  air  ﬂ ow, 
passenger  compartment  temperature 
and air distribution, by means of various 
sensors  (ambient  temperature,  interior 
temperature,  sunshine),  so  preventing 
the  need  for  you  to  change  your  set-
tings other than the value displayed. 

 For even air distribution, take care not 
to obstruct the exterior air intake grille 
located at the bottom of the windscreen, 
the vents, the air outlets under the front 
seats and the air extractor located be-
hind the ﬂ aps in the boot. 

 In certain cases of particularly arduous 
use  (towing  the  maximum  load  on  a 
steep gradient in hot weather), switch-
ing off the air conditioning saves engine 
power and therefore improves the tow-
ing capacity. 

 Do not cover the temperature and hu-
midity sensor  2  and the sunshine sen-
sor  7 . 
 They are required for regulation of the 
air conditioning. 

  Advice on operation 
 In hot weather, in order to obtain in-
tense  ventilation,  it  is  advisable  to 
use vents  1  and  4  only. 
 If, when the vehicle has been parked 
in the sun for a long time, the interior 
temperature remains very high, ﬁ rst 
ventilate  the  passenger  compart-
ment for a few minutes. 

 Close  the  windows  to  beneﬁ t  from  the 
full effectiveness of the air conditioning. 

 Ensure  that  the  passenger  compart-
ment  ﬁ lter  is  in  good  condition.  Have 
the ﬁ lter elements replaced periodically. 
If you drive in a dusty environment, re-
place it twice as often. 

 The  air  conditioning  system  does  not 
contain  chlorine  and  is  not  harmful  to 
the ozone layer. 
 Operate the air conditioning system for 
5 to 10 minutes, once or twice a month, 
to keep it in good working order. 

44

 The water formed by the air conditioning 
condensation is discharged via an open-
ing provided for this purpose. Therefore, 
a puddle of water may form underneath 
the vehicle when stationary. 
 If the system does not produce cold air, 
do not use it and have it checked by a 
CITROËN  dealer  or  a  qualiﬁ ed  work-
shop.

 In automatic mode: 
   (cid:41)   when the temperature is set to max-
imum (Rapid heating), the intake of

conditioning stops. 

  (cid:41)   when  the  temperature  is  set  to  mini-
mum (Rapid cooling), the air recircula-
tion is activated and the air conditioning 
operates.  

 When the engine is cold, to avoid an 
excessive distribution of cold air, the 
ventilation will reach its optimum lev-
el gradually. 
 On  entering  the  vehicle,  the  interior 
temperature may be much colder (or 
warmer)  than  the  comfort  tempera-
ture. There is no need to change the 
temperature  displayed  in  order  to 
reach the comfort required rapidly. 
 The  automatic  regulation  of  the  air

 Make a careful note of the number of each key. This number is coded on the label attached to the key. 
 If the keys are lost, a CITROËN dealer can supply you with new keys.

  Remote control 
 The high frequency remote control is a sensitive system; do not operate it while it is in your pocket as there is a possibility 
that it may unlock the vehicle, without you being aware of it. 
 Do not repeatedly press the buttons of your remote control out of range and out of sight of your vehicle.   You run the risk 
of stopping it from working.
The remote control does not operate when the key is in the ignition, even when the ignition is switched off.  
  Locking the vehicle
 Driving with the doors locked may make access to the passenger compartment by the emergency services more difﬁ cult 
in an emergency. 
 As a safety precaution (with children on board), remove the key from the ignition when you leave the vehicle, even for a 
short time.  
  Anti-theft protection 
 Do not make any modiﬁ cations to the electronic engine immobiliser system, this could cause malfunctions.  

  When purchasing a second-hand vehicle 
 Have the key codes memorised by a CITROËN dealer, to ensure that the keys in your possession are the only ones which 
can start the vehicle.  

         Do not throw the remote control batteries away, they contain metals which are harmful to the environment. 
 Take them to an approved collection point.

 CHILD SEAT IN THE FRONT  

  "Rearwards-facing" 

  "Forwards-facing" 

GENERAL POINTS RELATING 
TO CHILD SEATS 

 Although  one  of  CITROËN's  main  cri-
teria  when  designing  your  vehicle,  the 
safety of your children also depends on 
you. 

 For  maximum  safety,  please  observe 
the following recommendations: 
   -  

in  accordance  with  European  reg-
ulations,   all  children  under  the 
age of 12 or less than one and a 
half metres tall must travel in ap-
proved child seats suited to their 
weight ,  on  seats  ﬁ tted  with  a  seat 
belt or ISOFIX mountings * , 
 statistically,  the  safest  seats  in 
your vehicle for carrying children 
are the rear seats,  
 a  child  weighing  less  than  9  kg 
must  travel  in  the  "rearwards-
facing" position both in the front 
and in the rear.   

V

  -  

  -  

!
 When a "rearwards-facing" child 
seat  is  installed  on  the   front 
passenger  seat ,  it  is  essential 
that the passenger airbag is deacti-
vated.  Otherwise,   the  child  would 
risk  being  seriously  injured  or 
killed if the airbag were to inﬂ ate .  

 When a "forwards-facing" child seat is 
installed on the  front passenger seat , 
adjust the vehicle's seat to the interme-
diate longitudinal position with the seat 
back  upright  and  leave  the  passenger 
airbag activated.  

  CITROËN  recommends   that  children 
should travel in the  rear seats  of your ve-
hicle: 
   -  
  -  

 "rearwards-facing"  up to the age of 2, 
 "forwards-facing"  over the age of 2.  

94

  *    The  rules  for  carrying  children  are 
speciﬁ c to each country. Refer to the 
current legislation in your country.

two  rings   A ,  located  between  the 
vehicle seat back and cushion, indi-
cated by a label, 

  -   a ring  B , used to ﬁ x the upper strap, 
referred to as the  TOP TETHER , in-
dicated by a label.  

 This ISOFIX mounting system provides 
fast, reliable and safe ﬁ tting of the child 
seat in your vehicle. 
 The  ISOFIX child seats  are ﬁ tted with 
two latches which are secured easily on 
the two rings  A . 
 Some also have an  upper strap  which 
is attached to the ring  B . 
 To attach this strap, remove the vehicle 
seat's head restraint. Then ﬁ x the hook 
on  the  ring   B   and  tighten  the  upper 
strap.

ADVICE ON CHILD SEATS 

!
 The  incorrect  installation  of  a  child 
seat  in  a  vehicle  compromises  the 
child's protection in the event of an ac-
cident. 
 Remember to fasten the seat belts or 
the child seat harnesses  keeping the 
slack  in relation to the child's body  to 
a minimum , even for short journeys. 
 For  optimum  installation  of  the  "for-
ward  facing"  child  seat,  ensure  that 
the back of the child seat is in contact 
with the back of the vehicle's seat and 
that the head restraint does not cause 
any discomfort. 
 If the head restraint has to be removed, 
ensure that it is stored or attached se-
curely  to  prevent  it  from  being  thrown 
around the vehicle in the event of sharp 
braking. 
 Children under the age of 10 must not 
travel  in  the  "forward  facing"  position 
on  the  front  passenger  seat,  unless 
the  rear  seats  are  already  occupied 
by  other  children,  cannot  be  used  or 
are absent. 
 Deactivate  the  passenger's  airbag 
when  a  "rear  facing"  child  seat  is  in-
stalled  on  the  front  seat.  Otherwise, 
the  child  would  risk  being  seriously 
injured  or  killed  if  the  airbag  were  to 
inﬂ ate.  

C H I L D   S A F E T Y

  Installing a booster seat 
 The  chest  part  of  the  seat  belt  must 
be  positioned  on  the  child's  shoulder 
without touching the neck. 
 Ensure  that  the  lap  part  of  the  seat 
belt  passes  correctly  over  the  child's 
thighs. 
 CITROËN  recommends  the  use  of 
a  booster  seat  which  has  a  back,  ﬁ t-
ted with a seat belt guide at shoulder 
level. 

CHILD LOCK 
 Mechanical  system  to  prevent  open-
ing of the rear doors using their interior 
controls. 
 The  control  is  located  on  the  edge  of 
each rear door.  

  Child lock on 

 As a safety precaution, do not leave: 
   -   one or more children alone and un-

supervised in a vehicle, 

  -  

  -   a  child  or  an  animal  in  a  vehicle 
which is exposed to the sun, with 
the windows closed, 
the  keys  within  reach  of  children 
inside the vehicle.  

 To  prevent  accidental  opening  of  the 
doors, use the "Child lock". 
 Take  care  not  to  open  the  rear  win-
dows by more than one third. 
 To  protect  young  children  from  the 
rays of the sun, ﬁ t side blinds on the 
rear windows.

BRAKING ASSISTANCE
SYSTEMS
 Group of supplementary systems which 
help  you  to  obtain  optimum  braking  in 
complete safety in emergency situations: 
   -   anti-lock braking system (ABS), 
  -   electronic  brake  force  distribution 

(EBFD).  

  Anti-lock braking system 
and electronic brake force 
distribution
 Linked systems which improve the sta-
bility and manoeuvrability of your vehi-
cle when braking, in particular on poor 
or slippery surfaces. 

  Activation 
 The anti-lock braking system is active if 
the vehicle speed is higher than 6 mph 
(10 km/h). It is deactivated when the ve-
hicle speed falls below 3 mph (5 km/h). 
 The  anti-lock  braking  system  comes 
into operation automatically when there 
is a risk of wheel lock. 
 Normal operation of the ABS may make 
itself felt by slight vibration of the brake 
pedal.

  Operating fault  
  When the vehicle is stationary 

 If this warning lamp comes on, accompa-
nied by the indication on the instrument 
panel screen, it indicates a malfunction of 
the anti-lock braking system which could 
result  in  a  loss  of  control  of  the  vehicle 
when braking. 
 Contact a CITROËN dealer or a quali-
ﬁ ed workshop. 

 The warning lamp comes on for a few 
seconds when the ignition is switched on 
(ON position). If it does not switch off or 
does not come on, contact a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualiﬁ ed workshop.  

  When the vehicle is moving 

 If  this  warning  lamp  comes  on 
continuously it indicates a mal-
function of the anti-lock braking 
system  which  could  result  in  a 
loss of control of the vehicle on braking. 
  You MUST stop as soon as it is safe 
to do so.  
 Contact a CITROËN dealer or a quali-
ﬁ ed workshop. 

 If  these  two  warning  lamps  come  on, 
linked with the warnings on the instru-
ment panel screen, they indicate a mal-
function  of  the  electronic  brake  force 
distribution which could result in a loss 
of control of the vehicle on braking. 
  You MUST stop as soon as it is safe 
to do so.  
 Contact a CITROËN dealer or a quali-
ﬁ ed workshop. 

 The  two  warning  lamps  comes  on 
at the same time and the two warn-
ings are displayed alternately in the 
instrument panel screen. 
 When  replacing  wheels  (tyres  and 
rims), ensure that they conform to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.

TRAJECTORY CONTROL 
SYSTEMS
  Associated  systems  which  guarantee 
the  directional  stability  of  the  vehicle 
within the limits of the laws of physics: 
   -  
  -   automatic stability control (ASC).   

traction control (TCL), 

   Deactivation 
 In  exceptional  conditions  (starting  a 
vehicle  which  is  bogged  down,  stuck 
in snow, on soft ground, ...), it may be 
better to deactivate the ASC system, so 
that the wheels can move freely and re-
gain grip. 

  Reactivation 
 These systems are not reactivated au-
tomatically above 30 mph (50 km/h). 
   (cid:41)   Press the  "ASC OFF"  button again 

to reactivate them manually.  

 Switching  off  of  the  symbol  in  the  top 
right  corner  of  the  instrument  panel 
screen indicates the reactivation of the 
ASC and TCL systems.  

  Traction control and automatic 
stability control
 Traction  control  optimises  traction  to 
prevent  wheel  spin,  by  acting  on  the 
brakes of the driving wheels and on the 
engine. 
 Automatic  stability  control  acts  on  the 
brake of one or more wheels and on the 
engine  to  keep  the  vehicle  on  the  tra-
jectory required by the driver. 

VI

  Activation 
 These systems are activated automati-
cally each time the vehicle is started. 
 They operate when the vehicle speed is 
higher than 10 mph (15 km/h). 

 They  come  into  operation  in 
the event of a grip or trajectory 
problem. 
 This  is  indicated  by  ﬂ ashing 
of this symbol on the instrument panel 
screen.   

104

   (cid:41)   Press the  "ASC OFF"  button, locat-
ed to the right of the steering wheel, 
until the ASC OFF symbol appears 
in the instrument panel screen.  

 The  display  of  this  symbol  in  the  top 
right  corner  of  the  instrument  panel 
screen indicates that the ASC and TCL 
systems are deactivated.

the 

 The display of this message 
in 
instrument  panel 
screen indicates a malfunc-
tion of these systems. 
 Contact a CITROËN deal-
er or a qualiﬁ ed workshop to have the 
ASC/TCL systems checked. 
!
 The ASC/TCL  systems  offer  ex-
ceptional safety in normal driving, 
but this should not encourage the 
driver  to  take  extra  risks  or  drive  at 
high speed. 
 The  correct  functioning  of  these  sys-
tems  depends  on  observation  of  the 
manufacturer’s recommendations on: 
   -   wheels (tyres and rims), 
  -   braking components 
  -   electronic components, 
  -   assembly and repair procedures.  
 After an impact, have these systems 
checked by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualiﬁ ed workshop.   

 SEAT BELTS 
  Front seat belts
  The front seat belts are ﬁ tted with a pre-
tensioning and force limiting system. 
 This system improves safety in the front 
seats in the event of a front or side im-
pact.  Depending  on  the  severity  of  the 
impact, the pretensioning system instant-
ly tightens the seat belts against the body 
of the occupants. 
 The pretensioning seat belts are active 
when the ignition is on. 
 The  force  limiter  reduces  the  pres-
sure of the seat belt on the chest of the 
occupant, so improving their protection.

 When  the  ignition  is  switched  on,  this 
warning  lamp  comes  on  the  centre 
console panel. 
 It is accompanied by an audible signal 
for a few seconds if the passenger has 
not fastened their seat belt. 
 If the seat belt is unfastened  while the 
vehicle is moving , you are alerted by 
the same warnings.   

Rear seat belts
 Each rear seat is ﬁ tted with a three-point 
inertia reel seat belt with force limiter. 

  Fastening 
   (cid:41)   Pull the strap, then insert the tongue 

in the buckle. 

  (cid:41)   Check that the seat belt is fastened 

correctly by pulling the strap.   

  Unfastening 
   (cid:41)   Press the red button on the buckle.    

   1.   Pass the seat belt under the support  A 

 located on each rear side pillar, 

  2.   Insert the tongue in the slot  B  of the 

support.   

  Rear buckles 

   (cid:41)   Store the buckles in the locations  A  
and   B   provided  for  this  purpose  in 
the rear seat cushion.    

!

      The driver must ensure that pas-
sengers use the seat belts correct-
ly and that they are all restrained 
securely before setting off. 

 Wherever you are seated in the vehicle, 
always  fasten  your  seat  belt,  even  for 
short journeys. 
 Do not interchange the seat belt buck-
les as they will not fulﬁ l their role fully. 
 The seat belts are ﬁ tted with an inertia 
reel  permitting  automatic  adjustment 
of the length of the strap to your size. 
The seat belt is stowed automatically 
when not in use. 
 Before and after use, ensure that the 
seat belt is reeled in correctly. 
 The  lower  part  of  the  strap  must  be 
positioned as low as possible on the 
pelvis. 
 The upper part must be positioned in 
the hollow of the shoulder. 
 The inertia reels are ﬁ tted with an auto-
matic locking device which comes into 
operation  in  the  event  of  a  collision, 
emergency  braking  or  if  the  vehicle 
rolls over. You can release the device 
by  pulling  ﬁ rmly  on  the  strap  and  re-
leasing it so that it reels in slightly. 

 In  order  to  be  effective,  a  seat  belt 
must: 
   -   be tightened as close to the body 

as possible, 

  -   be  pulled  in  front  of  you  with  a 
smooth  movement,  checking  that 
it does not twist, 

  -   be used to restrain only one person, 
  -   not bear any trace of cuts or fraying, 
  -   not  be  converted  or  modiﬁ ed  to 

avoid affecting its performance.  

 In accordance with current safety reg-
ulations, for all repairs on your vehicle, 
go  to  a  qualiﬁ ed  workshop  with  the 
skills and equipment needed, which a 
CITROËN dealer is able to provide. 
 Have  your  seat  belts  checked  regu-
larly by a CITROËN dealer or a quali-
ﬁ ed workshop, particularly if the straps 
show signs of damage. 
 Clean the seat belt straps with soapy 
water  or  a  textile  cleaning  product, 
sold by CITROËN dealers. 
 After folding or moving a seat or rear 
bench seat, ensure that the seat belt is 
positioned and reeled in correctly.  

  Recommendations for children 
 Use a suitable child seat if the passen-
ger is less than 12 years old or shorter 
than one and a half metres. 
 Never  use  the  same  seat  belt  to  se-
cure more than one person. 
 Never allow a child to travel on your lap.  

  In the event of an impact 
  Depending on the nature and serious-
ness of the impact , the pretensioning 
device may be deployed before and in-
dependently of the airbags. Deployment 
of the pretensioners is accompanied by 
a  slight  discharge  of  harmless  smoke 
and a noise, due to the activation of the 
pyrotechnic  cartridge  incorporated  in 
the system. 
 In all cases, the airbag warning lamp 
comes on. 
 Following  an  impact,  have  the  seat 
belts  system  checked,  and  if  neces-
sary replaced, by a CITROËN dealer 
or a qualiﬁ ed workshop.

  AIRBAGS

  Impact detection zones 

   System designed to maximise the safety 
of the occupants (with the exception of 
the rear centre passenger) in the event 
of violent collisions. It supplements the 
action of the force-limiting seat belts. 

Front airbags
 System  which  protects  the  head  and 
chest of the driver and front passenger 
in the event of a front impact. 
 The driver's airbag is ﬁ tted in the centre 
of the steering wheel; the front passen-
ger's  airbag  is  ﬁ tted  in  the  dashboard 
above the glove box. 

 If a collision occurs, the electronic de-
tectors  record  and  analyse  the  front 
and  side  impacts  sustained  in  the  im-
pact detection zones: 
   -  

in the case of a serious impact, the 
airbags  are  deployed  instantly  and 
protect the occupants of the vehicle 
(with the exception of the rear cen-
tre passenger); immediately after the 
impact, the airbags deﬂ ate rapidly so 
that they do not hinder visibility or the 
exit of the occupants, 
in the case of a minor or rear impact 
or in certain roll-over conditions, the 
airbags  will  not  be  deployed;  the 
seat  belt  alone  is  sufﬁ cient  to  pro-
vide  optimum  protection  in  these 
situations.

  The airbags do not operate 
when the ignition is switched 
off.

 This  equipment  will  only  operate 
once. If a second impact occurs (dur-
ing the same or a subsequent acci-
dent), the airbag will not operate.

   A.   Front impact zone. 
  B.   Side impact zone.  

 Deployment  of  the  airbag(s)  is  ac-
companied  by  a  slight  emission  of 
harmless smoke and a noise, due to 
the activation of the pyrotechnic car-
tridge incorporated in the system. 
 This smoke is not harmful, but sensi-
tive individuals may experience slight 
irritation. 
 The noise of the detonation may re-
sult  in  a  slight  loss  of  hearing  for  a 
short time.   

  Deployment 
 The  airbags  are  deployed  simultane-
ously,  unless  the  passenger's  front 
airbag  is  deactivated,  in  the  event  of 
a serious front impact applied to all or 
part of the front impact zone  A , in the 
longitudinal centreline of the vehicle on 
a horizontal plane and directed from the 
front to the rear of the vehicle. 
 The  front  airbag  inﬂ ates  between  the 
front  occupant  of  the  vehicle  and  the 
dashboard  to  cushion  their  forward 
movement.

  Deactivation 
 Only  the  front  passenger's  airbag  can 
be deactivated: 
   (cid:41)    with the ignition off , insert the key 
in  the  passenger  airbag  deactiva-
tion switch  A , 

  (cid:41)   turn it to the  "OFF"  position, 
  (cid:41)   remove the key.  

!
 To  ensure  the  safety  of  your 
child,  the  passenger's  airbag 
must  be  deactivated  when  you 
install  a  "rear  facing"  child  seat  on 
the front passenger seat. 
 Otherwise, the child would risk being 
seriously injured or killed if the airbag 
were triggered.  

  Operating fault 

  Reactivation 
 When  you  remove  the  child  seat,  turn 
switch  A  to the  "ON"  position to reacti-
vate the airbag and so ensure the safe-
ty of your front passenger in the event 
of an impact. 
 The associated warning lamp goes off.  

 If  this  warning  lamp  comes  on  on  the
  instrument  panel  and  this  display  ap-

  Operating fault 

 If this warning lamp comes on in the instru-
ment  panel  and  this  display  appears  in  the 
instrument panel screen, contact a CITROËN 
dealer  or  a  qualiﬁ ed  workshop  to  have  the 
system checked. The airbags may no longer 
be deployed in the event of a serious impact.   

              For the airbags to be fully 
effective, observe the 
following safety rules: 

!
 Sit in a normal upright position. 
 Wear a correctly adjusted seat belt. 
 Do  not  leave  anything  between  the 
occupants  and  the  airbags  (a  child, 
pet,  object...). This  could  hamper  the 
operation  of  the  airbags  or  injure  the 
occupants. 

 After an accident or if the vehicle has 
been  stolen  or  broken  into,  have  the 
airbag systems checked. 
 All work on the airbag system must be 
carried out by a CITROËN dealer or a 
qualiﬁ ed workshop. 

 Even  if  all  of  the  precautions  men-
tioned  are  observed,  a  risk  of  injury 
or  of  minor  burns  to  the  head,  chest 
or  arms  when  an  airbag  is  deployed 
cannot be ruled out. The bag inﬂ ates 
almost instantly (within a few millisec-
onds)  then  deﬂ ates  within  the  same 
time discharging the hot gas via open-
ings provided for this purpose.  

  Front airbags 
 Do not drive holding the steering wheel by its spokes or resting your hands on 
the centre part of the wheel. 
 Passengers must not place their feet on the dashboard. 
 If possible, do not smoke as deployment of the airbags can cause burns or the 
risk of injury from a cigarette or pipe. 
 Never remove or pierce the steering wheel or hit it violently.   

   Lateral airbags 
 Use  only  approved  covers  on  the  seats,  compatible  with  the  deployment  the 
lateral  airbags.  For  information  on  the  range  of  seat  covers  suitable  for  your 
vehicle,  you  can  contact  a  CITROËN dealer  (see  "Practical  information  -  § 
Accessories"). 
 Do not ﬁ x or attach anything to the seat backs (clothing...). This could cause 
injury to the chest or arms if the lateral airbag is deployed. 
 Do not sit with the upper part of the body any nearer to the door than necessary.  

  Curtain airbags 
 Do not ﬁ x or attach anything to the roof. This could cause injury to the head if 
the curtain airbag is deployed. 
 If ﬁ tted on your vehicle, do not remove the grab handles installed on the roof, 
they play a part in securing the curtain airbags.

CVT GEARBOX
 The  six-speed  automatic  gearbox  of-
fers  a  choice  between  the  comfort  of 
automatic regulation or the pleasure of 
manual gear changing. 
 This gearbox has two driving modes: 
   -   an  automated  mode  for  automatic 
control of the gears by the gearbox 
and therefore without any action on 
the part of the driver, 
  -   a  sequential  mode 

for  manual 
changing of the gears by the driver 
using the steering mounted controls 
or the gear lever.  

 It consists of the following controls: 
   -   a gear lever  1  on the centre console 
for selecting the driving mode, reverse 
gear and neutral or for changing gear 
in sequential mode,

 Three  transmission  modes  are  available 
and can be selected manually by the driv-
er in accordance with his requirements. 
 You  can  change  transmission  mode 
when  stationary  or  while  driving  at  a 
speed  below 60 mph (100 km/h) . 
 The transmission mode can be selected 
by turning the control  A . 

  4WD LOCK (position 2) 
 The  vehicle  operates  with  four  wheel 
drive in this mode also. 
 It is recommended when grip is particularly 
poor or difﬁ cult (sand, mud, slopes, ...).  

  2WD (position 3) 
 The  vehicle  operates  with  front  two 
wheel drive. 
 This  mode  corresponds  to  use  on  a  tar-
macked road on which the driver considers 
that there is no risk of loss of grip (dry road). 

 The  selection  of  this  mode  is  recom-
mended when the level of grip permits.   

Display in the instrument panel

 The  transmission  mode  is  displayed 
in the form of an intermittent display in 
the  instrument  panel  screen  when  the 
transmission mode is selected.

  Have your vehicle towed on a ﬂ at-
bed.  

!
 The vehicle must not be towed with 
the front or rear wheels on the ground 
even if it is in front "2WD" (2 wheel 
drive) mode.   

D R I V I N G

 Do not subject the vehicle to excessive 
conditions while driving. 
 As  the  engine  torque  is  applied  to 
all four wheels, the condition of the 
tyres has a considerable impact on 
the performance of the vehicle. 
 Ensure that all four tyres are in good 
condition. 
 Avoid  driving  the  vehicle  in  sandy 
or muddy areas or in other areas in 
which the wheels could spin. 
 Spinning  the  wheels  places  the 
transmission  components  under 
pressure and could cause a serious 
malfunction. 
 Do  not  drive  the  vehicle  through 
deep water. 
 Avoid  driving  over  excessively  un-
even terrain (risk of scraping under 
the body or of grounding on crossing 
a bridge). 

  Operating faults 

 If the selected transmission mode display 
ﬂ ashes,  the  vehicle  switches  automati-
cally to front  "2WD"  transmission mode. 
 It is then no longer possible to select the 
transmission mode using the control  A . 

 If  the  message  "SLOW  DOWN"  is  dis-
played  on  the  instrument  panel,  let  the 
transmission cool down then wait for the 
display to clear before setting off again. 

VII

 If  "4WD"  and  "LOCK"  are  displayed 
alternately  and 
if  "MAINTENANCE 
REQUIRED" is displayed in the instru-
ment panel, the system has failed and 
the safety system has been activated.

CRUISE CONTROL 

  Steering mounted controls

Display on the instrument panel 

D R I V I N G

  System which automatically maintains the 
vehicle speed at the value programmed 
by  the  driver,  without  any  action  on  the 
accelerator pedal. 

 The cruise control is  switched on  man-
ually: the vehicle speed must be 25 mph 
(40  km/h)  minimum  and  second  gear 
must be engaged in the case of a man-
ual gearbox. 

 The cruise control is  switched off  man-
ually, by an action on the brake or clutch 
pedal or if the ASC system is triggered. 

 The  programmed  speed  can  be  ex-
ceeded temporarily by pressing the ac-
celerator pedal. 
 To  return  to  the  programmed  speed, 
simply release the accelerator pedal. 

 Switching  off  the  ignition  cancels  any 
programmed speed value. 

 The cruise control cannot, in any cir-
cumstances,  take  the  place  of  the 
need to comply with speed limits or 
of the vigilance and responsibility of 
the driver.  

 The controls of this system are grouped 
together on the steering wheel. 
   1.    "ON/OFF"  button: activation / deac-
tivation of the cruise control mode. 
  2.    "COAST SET"  button: storing of a

be extremely hot (risk of burns). 

  Oil level

 The reading will only be correct 
if the vehicle is on level ground 
and the engine has been off for 
more than 30 minutes. 

 The  check  is  carried  out  either  when 
the ignition is switched on using the oil 
level indicator on the instrument panel, 
or using the dipstick. 
 It is normal to top up the engine oil between 
services.  The  manufacturer  recommends 
that the oil level be checked, and topped up 
if necessary, every 3 000 miles (5 000 km). 
  Changing the engine oil 
 Refer to the servicing booklet for details 
of the interval for this operation. 
 In order to maintain the reliability of the 
engine  and  emission  control  system, 
the use of additives in the engine oil is 
prohibited.  

  Oil speciﬁ cation 
 The  oil  must  correspond  to  your  engine 
and conform to the manufacturer's recom-
mendations.

  Brake fluid level 

 The brake ﬂ uid level should be 
between the "MAX" and "MIN" 
marks. 
 If it is not, check the brake pad 
wear. 

  Changing the brake ﬂ uid 
 Refer to the servicing booklet for details 
of the interval for this operation.  

  Fluid speciﬁ cation 
 The  brake  ﬂ uid  must  conform  to  the 
manufacturer's  recommendations  and 
fulﬁ l the DOT4 standards.   

  Coolant level 

 The coolant level must be mea-
sured when the engine is cold 
and  should  be  between  the 
"LOW" and "FULL" marks. 
 When the engine is warm, the 
temperature of the coolant is regulated 
by the fan. This can operate with the ig-
nition off. 
 On  vehicles  which  are  ﬁ tted  with  a 
particle  emission  ﬁ lter,  the  fan  may 
operate  after  the  vehicle  has  been 
switched  off,  even  if  the  engine  is 
cold. 
 In  addition,  as  the  cooling  system  is 
pressurised, wait at least one hour after 
switching off the engine before carrying 
out any work. 

 To avoid any risk of scalding, unscrew 
the cap by two turns to allow the pres-
sure  to  drop.  When  the  pressure  has 
dropped,  remove  the  cap  and  top  up 
the level.

CHECKS
 Unless  otherwise 
indicated,  check 
these  components  in  accordance  with 
the servicing booklet and in relation to 
your engine. 
 Otherwise,  have 
them  checked  by  a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualiﬁ ed workshop. 

  Battery 

 Check  the  electrolyte  level 
regularly. If necessary, top up 
the level with distilled water. 
 Check  that  the  terminals  are 
clean and correctly tightened, 

particularly in summer and winter. 
 When carrying out work on the battery, 
refer to the "Practical information" sec-
tion for details of the precautions to be 
taken before disconnecting the battery 
and following its reconnection.  

  Air filter and passenger compartment filter 
 Refer to the servicing booklet 
for details of the replacement 
intervals  for  these  compo-
nents. 
 Depending  on  the  environ-
ment (dusty atmosphere...) and the use 
of  the  vehicle  (city  driving...),  replace 
them twice as often if necessary (refer 
to the "Engines" paragraph). 
 A  clogged  passenger  compartment  ﬁ l-
ter may have an adverse effect on the 
performance of the air conditioning sys-
tem and generate undesirable odours.  

Particle emission filter (Diesel) 
 Maintenance of the particle emission ﬁ l-
ter must be carried out by a CITROËN 
dealer or a qualiﬁ ed workshop. 

 Following  prolonged  operation  of 
the  vehicle  at  very  low  speed  or  at 
idle,  you  may,  exceptionally,  notice 
the emission of water vapour at the 
exhaust  on  acceleration.  This  does 
not  have  any  adverse  effect  on  the 
performance of the vehicle or on the 
environment.  

Oil filter 

 Replace the oil ﬁ lter each time 
the engine oil is changed. 
 Refer to the servicing booklet 
for details of the replacement 
interval for this component. 

 Do not discard the oil ﬁ lter through public 
channels, deposit it in the containers dedi-
cated to this use in the CITROËN network 
(France) or a qualiﬁ ed workshop or take them to 
an authorised waste disposal site.

tem,  the  parking  brake  must 
be  adjusted,  even  between 
two services. 

 This  system  must  be  checked  by  a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualiﬁ ed workshop. 
 Only  use  products  recommended  by 
CITROËN  or  products  of  equivalent 
quality and speciﬁ cations. 

  Transfer box and rear

  Brake pads 

 Brake  wear  depends  on  the 
style of driving, particularly in 
the  case  of  vehicles  used  in 
town,  over  short  distances.  It 
may be necessary to have the 
condition of the brakes checked, even 
between vehicle services. 
 Unless there is a leak on the circuit, a 
drop  in  the  brake  ﬂ uid  level  indicates 
that the brake pads are worn.

  Towing another vehicle

  General recommendations 
 Observe the legislation in force in your country. 
 Ensure that the weight of the towing vehicle is higher than that of the towed 
vehicle. 
 The driver must stay at the wheel of the towed vehicle. 
 Driving on motorways and fast roads is prohibited when towing. 
 When towing a vehicle with all four wheels on the ground, always use an ap-
proved towing bar; rope and straps are prohibited. 
 When towing a vehicle with the engine off, there is no longer any power assis-
tance for braking or steering. 
 In the following cases, you must always call on a professional recovery service: 
   -   vehicle broken down on a motorway or fast road, 
  -   when it is not possible to put the gearbox into neutral, unlock the steering, 

or release the parking brake, 
towing with only two wheels on the ground, 

  -  
  -   where there is no approved towing bar available...   

   (cid:41)   On  the  rear  bumper,  remove  the 
cover by pulling at the bottom using 
the jack handle  2 . 

  (cid:41)   Screw in the towing eye fully using 

the wheelbrace  3 . 
  (cid:41)   Install the towbar. 
  (cid:41)   Switch on the hazard warning lamps 

on the towed vehicle.  

!

 When being towed with the en-
gine  off,  there  is  no  longer  any 
braking or steering assistance.

TOWING A TRAILER,
CARAVAN, ETC.
  Your  vehicle  is  primarily  designed  for 
transporting people and luggage, but it 
may also be used for towing a trailer. 

!
 We recommend the use of gen-
uine  CITROËN  towbars  and 
their harnesses that have been 
tested and approved from the design 
stage of your vehicle and that the ﬁ t-
ting  of  the  towbar  is  entrusted  to  a 
CITROËN dealer or a qualiﬁ ed work-
shop. 
 If  the  towbar  is  not  ﬁ tted  by  a 
CITROËN  dealer,  it  is  imperative 
that it is ﬁ tted using the electrical pre-
equipment located at the rear of the 
vehicle  and  in  accordance  with  the 
manufacturer's instructions. 
 Driving  with  a  trailer  subjects  the 
towing  vehicle  to  more  signiﬁ cant 
stress and its driver must be particu-
larly careful.  

IX

156

  Driving advice
  Distribution of loads 
   (cid:41)   Distribute  the  load  in  the  trailer  so 
that the heaviest items are as close 
as possible to the axle and the nose 
weight  approaches  the  maximum 
permitted without exceeding it.  

 Air density decreases with altitude, thus 
reducing  engine  performance.  Above 
1 000  metres,  the  maximum  towing 
load  must  be  reduced  by  10 %  of  the 
GTW and so on for every 1 000 metres 
of altitude. 
 Refer to the "Technical Data" section for 
details of the weights and towing loads 
which apply to your vehicle.  

  Side wind 
   (cid:41)   Take  into  account  the  increased 

sensitivity to side wind.   

  Cooling 
 Towing  a  trailer  on  a  slope  increases 
the temperature of the coolant. 
 As  the  fan  is  electrically  controlled,  its 
cooling  capacity  is  not  dependent  on 
the engine speed. 
   (cid:41)   To lower the engine speed, reduce 

your speed.  

 The  maximum  towing  load  on  a  long 
slope depends on the gradient and the 
outside temperature. 
 In all cases, pay attention to the coolant 
temperature. 

   (cid:41)   If  this  message  is  dis-
played,   stop  your  ve-
hicle as soon as it is 
safe to do so.   

 If the message ﬂ ashes slowly, wait for 
the engine to cool before topping up the 
level, if necessary. 
 If the message ﬂ ashes rapidly, contact 
a CITROËN dealer or a qualiﬁ ed work-
shop without delay.  

  Braking 
 Towing  a  trailer  increases  the  braking 
distance.  

  Tyres 
   (cid:41)   Check the tyre pressures of the towing 
vehicle and of the trailer, observing the 
recommended pressures.   

  Lighting 
   (cid:41)   Check the lighting and signalling on 

the trailer.  
!

 Opening of the lower tailgate is 
prohibited  if  a  towbar  is  being 
used.

FITTING ROOF BARS 
 Consult a CITROËN dealer or a quali-
ﬁ ed workshop for the installation of lon-
gitudinal roof bars. 
 When  ﬁ tting  transverse  roof  bars,  en-
sure  that  they  are  positioned  correctly 
as shown by marks on the longitudinal 
roof bars. 

 Use  accessories  recommended  by 
CITROËN  and  follow  the  accessory 
manufacturer's ﬁ tting instructions. 
 In order to place a load on the roof, your 
vehicle must be ﬁ tted with longitudinal 
roof bars with transverse roof bars ﬁ tted 
on top of these. 
 The longitudinal roof bars cannot be re-
moved. 

 Maximum authorised weight on the roof 
bars, for a loading height not exceeding 
40 cm (except bicycle carriers): 80 kg. 
 If the height exceeds 40 cm, adapt 
the speed of the vehicle to the con-
dition of the road, to avoid damaging 
the roof bars and the ﬁ xings on the 
roof. 
 Please  refer  to  national  legislation 
to  comply  with  the  regulations  re-
garding the transportation of objects 
which are longer than the vehicle.

"RDS" 
 The "Radio Data System" (RDS) function 
on the FM waveband permits: 
   -   access to the display of information, 
such as the name of the station, ... 
tuning to the same station while trav-
elling through different regions, 
temporary tuning to trafﬁ c information 
announcements.  

 Most  FM  stations  use  RDS.  These 
stations  transmit  non-audible  data  in 
addition to their programmes. 
 The data transmitted in this way allows 
you access to various functions, mainly 
displaying  of  the  name  of  the  station, 
automatic station following or temporary 
tuning  to  trafﬁ c  information  announce-
ments. 
 The RDS allows you to continue listen-
ing to the same station by means of the 
alternative  frequency  following.  How-
ever,  in  certain  conditions,  this  RDS 
frequency following cannot be provided 
throughout  the  country.  Radio  stations 
do not cover the whole country, which 
explains the loss of reception of the sta-
tion during a journey. 

  Alternative frequencies "AF"
 Your  radio  automatically  checks  and 
selects the best frequency for the radio 
station to which it is tuned (if the station 
broadcasts  on  several  transmitters  or 
frequencies). 
 The  frequency  of  a  radio  station  cov-
ers approximately 30 miles (50 km). The 
change  from  one  frequency  to  another 
explains the temporary loss of reception 
during a journey. 
 If the station to which you are listening does 
not have several frequencies in the region in 
which you are currently located, you can de-
activate the alternative frequency following.  
  Regional following mode "REG"
 Some stations are organised in a network. 
 In different regions, they broadcast diffe-
rent  or  shared  programmes  depending 
on the time of day. 
 You can follow: 
   -   a regional station only, 
  -  

the entire network, with the possibility 
that you will be listening to a different 
programme.  

 The  "AF",  "REG"  and  "TP" 
functions  can  be  deacti-
vated  or  activated  via  the 
"TUNE"  button 
functions 
setting mode. 

 On long distance journeys, when the 
stored station becomes weak, the ra-
dio searches ﬁ rst for another frequen-
cy for the same station (AF). Then, if 
this fails, it searches for a frequency 
broadcasting the regional programme 
(REG). If this also fails, the radio re-
turns to the stored station.

  Traffic information "TP" 
 The "Trafﬁ c Program" (TP) function per-
mits automatic and temporary switching 
to an FM station broadcasting trafﬁ c in-
formation. 
 The radio station or the source that you 
are listening to at this point is paused. 
 Once the trafﬁ c information has ended, 
the  system  switches  back  to  the  radio 
station or the source that you were lis-
tening to initially. 

 Press the "TP" button. 
 "TP" appears on the display. 
If  the  station  is  compatible,

 If  the  radio  detects  trafﬁ c  information, 
"TRAF  INF"  appears  on  the  display, 
followed by the frequency of the broad-
casting station, then its name. 
 The volume is different from that of the 
previous source. 
 Following the broadcasting of the trafﬁ c 
information, the volume returns to that 
of the source prior to the interruption. 

 When  "TP"  appears  on  the  display, 
the radio stops solely at RDS stations 
broadcasting trafﬁ c information.

NAVIGATION-GUIDANCE 
  GPS 
  What is the navigation system and 
the GPS? 
 The satellite navigation system guides 
the driver to the destination that he has 
set in accordance with a chosen route. 
 Initially,  it  searches  for  the  destination 
required by the user, then it calculates 
the route and ﬁ nally it provides the vi-
sual and audible guidance instructions. 

  What precautions should be 
observed in order to make best use 
of the system? 
 Do  not  place  anything  on  or  near  the 
GPS aerial. 
 Do  not  use  any  digital  communication 
equipment  (personal  computers,  etc.) 
near the GPS aerial. 
 Do not afﬁ x any reﬂ ective ﬁ lms or ﬁ lms 
containing carbon to the windows. 

 The  system's  measurements  may  be 
inaccurate if the vehicle is: 
   -  
  -   underneath a two-level motorway, 
  -  

in a tunnel or underground car park, 

in  an  area  with  several  very  high 
buildings, 

  -   surrounded by closely planted trees.  
 Depending  on  the  vehicle's  situation 
and the reception of the GPS informa-
tion, the displayed information may dis-
appear from the screen temporarily.  

 The  GPS  (Global  Position-
ing  System)  consists  of 
several  satellites  distribut-
ed  around  the  earth.  They 
continuously  transmit  digi-
tal signals which travel at the speed of 
light, on 2 different frequencies. 
 At any given time, the system receives 
its  position  in  relation  to  the  satellites 
detected  and  the  time  of  transmission 
of the signal. 
 This  enables  the  telematic  unit  to  cal-
culate its position and therefore that of 
the vehicle. 
 A repositioning process using the map 
database stored on the hard disk allows 
the vehicle to be positioned on the road 
network, so improving the accuracy of 
the vehicle location function.

  What is a point of interest 
(POI)? 

 A  point  of  interest  (POI)  is 
represented  by  an  icon  on 
the  map,  it  represents  an 
airport,  a  station,  a  town 
hall, ... 

 Up to 40 different icons may 
be  displayed  (refer  to  the 
section  "Points  of  interest 
icon"). 
 They  are  classiﬁ ed 

in 
5 groups  and  identiﬁ ed  by  one  colour 
for each group: 
   -   Shops,  ﬁ nance  and  businesses 

(Green), 

  -   Vehicles and travel (Dark blue), 
  -   Restaurants (Orange), 
  -   Public  places  and  emergency  ser-

vices (Brown), 

  -   Entertainment and attractions (Blue).

AUDIO-VIDEO 

  What is RDS? 

  RDS station following 

  Trafﬁ c information function 

  Radio  Data  System  (RDS)  func-
tion on the FM waveband permits: 
tuning  to  the  same  station  while 
travelling  through  different  regions 
(if  the  transmitters  of  this  station 
cover  the  area  through  which  you 
are travelling), 
temporary  tuning  to  trafﬁ c  informa-
tion announcements, 

   -  

  -  

  -   display  of  the  name  of  the  station, 

etc...  

 Most FM stations use RDS. 
 These  stations  transmit  non-audible 
data in addition to their programmes. 
 The data transmitted in this way allows 
you access to various functions, mainly 
displaying  of  the  name  of  the  station, 
temporary  tuning  to  trafﬁ c  information 
announcements  or  automatic  station 
following. 
 RDS allows you to continue listening to the 
same station by means of the frequency 
following. However, in certain conditions, 
this  RDS  frequency  following  cannot  be 
provided  throughout  the  country.  Radio 
stations  do  not  cover  the  whole  country, 
which explains the loss of reception of the 
station during a journey.  

XI

190

 Your radio automatically checks 
and  selects  the  best  frequency 
for the radio station to which it is 
tuned (if the station broadcasts on sev-
eral transmitters or frequencies). 
 The frequency of a radio station covers 
approximately  30  miles  (50  km).  The 
change from one frequency to another 
explains the loss of reception during a 
journey. 
 If the station to which you are listening 
does  not  have  several  frequencies  in 
the region in which you are currently lo-
cated, you can deactivate the automatic 
frequency following.  

  The  Trafﬁc  Program  (TP)  func-
tion  permits  automatic  and 
temporary  switching  to  an  FM 
station broadcasting trafﬁ c infor-
mation. 

 The radio station or the source that you 
are listening to at this point is paused. 
 Once the trafﬁ c information has ended, 
the  system  switches  back  to  the  radio 
station or the source that you were lis-
tening to initially.  

  Regional following mode 

  Programme types 

 Some stations are organised in 
a network. 

 In different regions, they broadcast dif-
ferent or shared programmes depend-
ing on the time of day. 
 You can follow: 
   -   a regional station only, 
  -  

the entire network, with the possibility 
that you will be listening to a different

General notes on MP3/WMA CDs
  Playing an MP3/WMA CD 

 When the MP3/WMA CD is 
inserted in the player, play-
ing of the tracks is automatic. 
 The tracks cannot be recorded 
onto the music server. 

 You can play CDs with up to 8 levels, 
255 folders and 400 ﬁ les maximum.  

  What is the MP3/WMA ﬁ le format? 
 MP3  is  the  abbreviation  of  MPEG-1 
Audio Layer 3 and MPG is the abbrevia-
tion of Motion Pictures Experts Group, a 
digital video data compression standard 
used on media such as video CDs. 
 The  MP3  compression  reduces  the 
number of bytes in a song by eliminating 
the long sound waves in the range of fre-
quencies which are imperceptible to the 
human ear, so producing high quality au-
dio ﬁ les with a low volume of data. 
 This  compression  divides  the  size  of 
the content of a conventional audio CD 
by approximately 10, which means that 
the  content  of  10  audio  CDs  can  be 
recorded onto a single CD-R or CD-RW. 

  Acceptance of the ﬁ les 
 Some  blank  CDs  may  not  be  played 
by  your  equipment  (quality,  recording 
speed...). 
 When  you  burn  a  CD-R  or  CD-RW, 
select the ISO 9660 level 1.2 or Joliet 
burning standard. 
 To obtain the best acoustic quality pos-
sible, select the lowest burning speed. 
 The  MPEG1  and  MPEG2  standards 
are accepted. 
 Transmission  speeds  between  32  and 
320 kbits/s and scans between 16 kHz 
and 48 kHz are accepted. 
 To display the title information (the name 
of the artist, the title of the album, etc...), 
the information contained in the ID3 Tags 
or the WMA Tags must be included in the 
MP3/WMA ﬁ les burned onto the disc.  

 WMA  is  the  abbreviation  of  Windows 
Media Audio, another audio data com-
pression standard offered by Microsoft. 
 It can be used to create and save audio 
ﬁ les at a compression rate higher than 
that of the MP3 format.

ration are trademarks registered in the

has  already  been  allocated  to  an-
other  telephone,  the  system  asks 
you if you wish to replace this level 
of priority.
