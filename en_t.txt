For your information

Main Owner’s Manual
Please note that this manual applies to all models and explains all equipment,
including options. Therefore, you may find some explanations for equipment
not installed on your vehicle. 
All specifications provided in this manual are current at the time of printing.
However, because of the Toyota policy of continual product improvement, we
reserve the right to make changes at any time without notice.
Depending on specifications, the vehicle shown in the illustrations may differ
from your vehicle in terms of equipment.
Accessories, spare parts and modification of your Toyota
Both genuine Toyota and a wide variety of other spare parts and accessories
for Toyota vehicles are currently available on the market. Should it be deter-
mined that any of the genuine Toyota parts or accessories supplied with the
vehicle need to be replaced, Toyota recommends that genuine Toyota parts
or  accessories,  be  used  to  replace  them.  Other  parts  or  accessories  of
matching quality can also be used. Toyota cannot accept any liability or guar-
antee spare parts and accessories which are not genuine Toyota products,
nor for replacement or installation involving such parts. In addition, damage
or performance problems resulting from the use of non-genuine Toyota spare
parts or accessories may not be covered under warranty.
Installation of an RF-transmitter system
The installation of an RF-transmitter system in your vehicle could affect elec-
tronic systems such as: 
●Multiport fuel injection system/sequential multiport fuel injection system
●Dynamic radar cruise control system
●Cruise control system
●Anti-lock brake system
●SRS airbag system
●Seat belt pretensioner system
Be  sure  to  check  with  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized
repairer,  or  any  reliable  repairer  for  precautionary  measures  or  special
instructions regarding installation of an RF-transmitter system.
Further information regarding frequency bands, power levels, antenna posi-
tions and installation provisions for the installation of RF-transmitters, is avail-
able  on  request  at  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

Scrapping of your Toyota
The  SRS  airbag  and seat belt pretensioner devices  in  your  Toyota contain
explosive chemicals. If the vehicle is scrapped with the airbags and seat belt
pretensioners left as they are, this may cause an accident such as fire. Be
sure  to  have  the  systems  of  the  SRS  airbag  and  seat  belt  pretensioner
removed and disposed of by a qualified service shop or by any authorized
Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer before
you scrap your vehicle.

Your vehicle contains batteries and/or accumulators. Do not discard them
into  the  environment  but  cooperate  with  separate  collection  (Directive
2006/66/EC).

CAUTION

■General precautions while driving

Driving under the influence: Never drive your vehicle when under the influ-
ence of alcohol or drugs that have impaired your ability to operate your vehi-
cle.  Alcohol  and  certain  drugs  delay  reaction  time,  impair  judgment  and
reduce  coordination,  which  could  lead  to  an  accident  that  could  result  in
death or serious injury.
Defensive driving: Always drive defensively. Anticipate mistakes that other
drivers or pedestrians might make and be ready to avoid accidents.
Driver  distraction:  Always  give  your full attention  to driving.  Anything  that
distracts the driver, such as adjusting controls, talking on a cellular phone or
reading can result in a collision with resulting death or serious injury to you,
your occupants or others.

■General precaution regarding children’s safety

Never leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to
have or use the key.
Children may be able  to start  the vehicle or  shift the vehicle into neutral.
There is also a danger that children may injure themselves by playing with
the windows,  the moon roof, or  other  features  of the  vehicle. In  addition,
heat build-up or extremely cold temperatures inside the vehicle can be fatal
to children.

Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
●Do not adjust the position of the driver’s seat while driving.

Doing so could cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

●Do not place a cushion between the driver or passenger and the seatback.
A cushion may prevent correct posture from being achieved, and reduce
the effectiveness of the seat belt and head restraint.

●Do not place anything under the front seats.

Objects  placed  under  the  front  seats  may  become  jammed  in  the  seat
tracks and stop the seat from locking in place. This may lead to an acci-
dent and the adjustment mechanism may also be damaged.

●Always observe the legal speed limit when driving on public roads.
●When driving over long distances, take regular breaks before you start to

feel tired.
Also, if you feel tired or sleepy while driving, do not force yourself to con-
tinue driving and take a break immediately.

Seat belt pretensioners (front seats)
The  pretensioner  helps  the  seat
belt  to  quickly  restrain  the  occu-
pant  by  retracting  the  seat  belt
when  the  vehicle  is  subjected  to
certain types of severe frontal col-
lision  or  side  collision  (vehicles
with SRS side airbags and curtain
shield airbags).

The pretensioner may not activate
in  the  event  of  a  minor  frontal  or
side impact, or a rear impact.

Pre-crash seat belts (front seats of vehicles with pre-crash safety
system)
If the system determines that a collision is unavoidable, the front seat
belts will retract before the collision. (→P. 390)

■Emergency locking retractor (ELR)

The retractor will lock the belt during a sudden stop or on impact. It may also
lock if you lean forward too quickly. A slow, easy motion will allow the belt to
extend so that you can move around fully.

■Child seat belt usage

The seat belts of your vehicle were principally designed for persons of adult
size.
●Use  a  child  restraint  system  appropriate  for  the  child,  until  the  child

becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt. (→P. 57)

●When the child becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat

belt, follow the instructions on P. 36 regarding seat belt usage.
■Replacing the belt after the pretensioner has been activated

If the vehicle is involved in multiple collisions, the pretensioner will activate for
the first collision, but will not activate for the second or subsequent collisions.

■Seat belt regulations

If seat belt regulations exist in the country where you reside, please contact
any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable
repairer for seat belt replacement or installation.

CAUTION

Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of injury in the event of
sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident.
Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury.
■Wearing a seat belt

●Ensure that all passengers wear a seat belt.
●Always wear a seat belt properly.
●Each seat belt should be used by one person only. Do not use a seat belt

for more than one person at once, including children.

●Toyota recommends that children be seated in the rear seat and always

use a seat belt and/or an appropriate child restraint system.

●To achieve a proper seating position, do not recline the seat more than
necessary. The seat belt is most effective when the occupants are sitting
up straight and well back in the seats.

●Do not wear the shoulder belt under your arm.
●Always wear your seat belt low and snug across your hips.

■Pregnant women

Obtain medical advice and wear the seat
belt in the proper way. (→P. 36)
Women  who  are  pregnant  should  posi-
tion the lap belt as low as possible over
the  hips  in  the  same  manner  as  other
occupants,  extending  the  shoulder  belt
completely over the shoulder and avoid-
ing belt contact with the rounding of the
abdominal area.
If the  seat belt is not worn properly,  not
only  the  pregnant  woman,  but  also  the
fetus could suffer death or serious injury
as  a  result  of  sudden  braking,  sudden
swerving or a collision.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

CAUTION

■People suffering illness

Obtain medical advice and wear the seat belt in the proper way. (→P. 36)

■When children are in the vehicle

Do not  allow children  to play  with the  seat  belt.  If the  seat  belt  becomes
twisted around a child’s neck, it may lead to choking or other serious injuries
that could result in death. 
If this occurs and the buckle cannot be unfastened, scissors should be used
to cut the belt.

■Seat belt pretensioners

If the pretensioner has activated, the SRS warning light will come on. In that
case,  the  seat  belt  cannot  be  used  again  and  must  be  replaced  at  any
authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized  repairer,  or  any  reliable
repairer.

■Adjustable shoulder anchor

Always make sure the shoulder belt is positioned across the center of your
shoulder. The belt should be kept away from your neck, but not falling off
your shoulder. Failure to do so could reduce the amount of protection in an
accident and cause death or serious injuries in the event of a sudden stop,
sudden swerve or accident. (→P. 37)

■Seat belt damage and wear

●Do not damage the seat belts by allowing the belt, plate, or buckle to be

jammed in the door.

●Inspect the seat belt system periodically. Check for cuts, fraying, and loose
parts. Do not use a damaged seat belt until it is replaced. Damaged seat
belt cannot protect an occupant from death or serious injury.

●Ensure that the belt and plate are locked and the belt is not twisted.

If the seat belt does not function correctly, immediately contact any autho-
rized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.
●Replace the seat assembly, including the belts, if your vehicle has been

involved in a serious accident, even if there is no obvious damage.

●Do not attempt to install, remove, modify, disassemble or dispose of the
seat  belts.  Have  any  necessary  repairs  carried  out  by  any  authorized
Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer. Inap-
propriate handling may lead to incorrect operation.

1-1. For safe use

The  main  SRS  airbag  system  components  are  shown  above.  The
SRS airbag system is controlled by the airbag sensor assembly. As
the airbags deploy, a chemical reaction in the inflators quickly fills the
airbags  with  non-toxic  gas  to  help  restrain  the  motion  of  the  occu-
pants.

CAUTION

■SRS airbag precautions

Observe the following precautions regarding the SRS airbags. 
Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury.
●The  driver  and  all  passengers  in  the  vehicle  must  wear  their  seat  belts

properly.
The SRS airbags are supplemental devices to be used with the seat belts.
●The  SRS  driver  airbag  deploys  with  considerable  force,  and  can  cause

death or serious injury especially if the driver is very close to the airbag.
Since the risk zone for the driver’s airbag is the first 50 - 75 mm (2 - 3 in.)
of inflation, placing yourself 250 mm (10 in.) from your driver airbag pro-
vides you with a clear margin of safety. This distance is measured from
the center of the steering wheel to your breastbone. If you sit less than
250 mm (10 in.) away now, you can change your driving position in sev-
eral ways:
• Move your seat to the rear as far as you can while still reaching the ped-

als comfortably.

• Slightly  recline  the  back  of  the  seat.  Although  vehicle  designs  vary,
many drivers can achieve the 250 mm (10 in.) distance, even with the
driver seat all the way forward, simply by reclining the back of the seat
somewhat. If reclining the back of your seat makes it hard to see the
road, raise yourself by using a firm, non-slippery cushion, or raise the
seat if your vehicle has that feature.

• If your steering wheel is adjustable, tilt it downward. This points the air-

bag toward your chest instead of your head and neck.

The seat should be adjusted as recommended above, while still maintaining
control of the foot pedals, steering wheel, and your view of the instrument
panel controls.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

1-1. For safe use

45

CAUTION

■SRS airbag precautions

●The SRS front passenger airbag also deploys with considerable force, and
can cause death or serious injury especially if the front passenger is very
close to the airbag. The front passenger seat should be as far from the air-
bag  as  possible  with  the seatback adjusted,  so  the front passenger  sits
upright.

●Improperly seated and/or restrained infants and children can be killed or
seriously injured by a deploying airbag. An infant or child who is too small
to use a seat belt should be properly secured using a child restraint sys-
tem. Toyota strongly recommends that all infants and children be placed in
the rear seats of the vehicle and properly restrained. The rear seats are
safer for infants and children than the front passenger seat. (→P. 57)

●Do  not  sit  on  the  edge  of  the  seat  or

lean against the dashboard.

●Vehicles  with  SRS  curtain  shield  air-

bags:
Do  not  lean  against  the  door,  the  roof
side rail or the front, center and rear pil-
lars.

●Vehicles with SRS side airbags: 

Do  not  allow  anyone  to  kneel  on  the
passenger seats toward the door or put
their head or hands outside the vehicle.

●Do not  attach anything  to  or  lean any-
thing  against  areas  such  as  the  dash-
board,  steering  wheel  pad  and  lower
portion of the instrument panel. 
These  items  can  become  projectiles
when  the  SRS  driver,  front  passenger
and knee airbags (if equipped) deploy.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

■SRS airbag precautions

●Vehicles  with  SRS  curtain  shield  air-

bags: 
Do not attach anything to areas such as
the  door,  windshield  glass,  side  door
glass,  front,  center  or  rear  pillars,  roof
side rail and assist grip. (Except for the
speed limit sticker →P. 684)

●Vehicles  without  a  smart  entry  &  start

system:
Do not attach any heavy, sharp or hard
objects such as keys or accessories to
the  key.  The  objects  may  restrict  the
SRS knee airbag (if equipped) inflation
or  be  thrust  into  the  driver’s  seat  area
by  the  force  of  the  deploying  airbag,
thus causing a danger.

CAUTION

■SRS airbag precautions

●Vehicles with SRS side airbags: 

Do not use seat accessories which cover the parts where the SRS side
airbags  inflate  as  they  may  interfere  with  inflation  of  the  airbags.  Such
accessories may prevent the side airbags from activating correctly, disable
the  system  or  cause  the  side  airbags  to  inflate  accidentally,  resulting  in
death or serious injury.

●Do not strike or apply significant levels of force to the area of the SRS air-

bag components. 
Doing so can cause the SRS airbags to malfunction.

●Do not touch any of the component parts immediately after the SRS air-

bags have deployed (inflated) as they may be hot.

●If breathing becomes difficult after the SRS airbags have deployed, open a
door or window to allow fresh air in, or leave the vehicle if it is safe to do
so. Wash off any residue as soon as possible to prevent skin irritation. 

●If the areas where the SRS airbags are stored, such as the steering wheel
pad and front, center and rear pillar garnishes, are damaged or cracked,
have them replaced by any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer.

■Modification and disposal of SRS airbag system components

Do not dispose of your vehicle or perform any of the following modifications
without  consulting  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized
repairer,  or  any  reliable  repairer.  The  SRS  airbags  may  malfunction  or
deploy (inflate) accidentally, causing death or serious injury.
●Installation, removal, disassembly and repair of the SRS airbags
●Repairs,  modifications,  removal  or  replacement  of  the  steering  wheel,
instrument panel, dashboard, seats or seat upholstery, front, center and
rear pillars or roof side rail

●Repairs or modifications of the front fender, front bumper, or side of the

■If the SRS airbags deploy (inflate)

●Slight abrasions, burns, bruising etc., may be sustained from SRS airbags,

due to the extremely high speed deployment (inflation) by hot gases.

●A loud noise and white powder will be emitted.
●Vehicles with SRS curtain shield airbags:

Parts of the airbag module (steering wheel hub, airbag cover and inflator) as
well as the front seats, parts of the front, center and rear pillars and roof side
rail, may be hot for several minutes. The airbag itself may also be hot.
Vehicles without SRS curtain shield airbags:
Parts of the airbag module (steering wheel hub, airbag cover and inflator)
as well as the front seats may be hot for several minutes. The airbag itself
may also be hot.

●The windshield may crack.
●Vehicles  with  ERA-GLONASS:  If  the  SRS  airbags  deploy,  the  system  is
designed to send an emergency call* to the Public Safety Answering Point
(PSAP), notifying them of the vehicle’s location (without needing to push the
“SOS”  button)  and  an  agent  will  attempt  to  speak  with  the  occupants  to
ascertain the level of emergency and assistance required. If the occupants
are  unable  to  communicate,  the  agent  automatically  treats  the  call  as  an
emergency and helps to dispatch the necessary emergency services. 
(→P. 520)
*: In some cases, the call cannot be made. (→P. 522)

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

1-1. For safe use

■SRS airbag deployment conditions (SRS front airbags)

●The SRS front airbag will deploy in the event of an impact that exceeds the
set threshold level (the level of force corresponding to an approximately 20 -
30 km/h [12 - 18 mph] frontal collision with a fixed wall that does not move or
deform).
However, this threshold velocity will be considerably higher in the following
situations:
• If  the  vehicle  strikes  an  object,  such  as  a  parked  vehicle  or  sign  pole,

which can move or deform on impact

• If the vehicle is involved in an underride collision, such as a collision in
which the front of the vehicle “underrides”, or goes under, the bed of a
truck

●Depending on the type of collision, it is possible that only the seat belt pre-

tensioners will activate.

■SRS airbag deployment conditions (SRS side airbags and curtain shield

airbags)
The SRS side and curtain shield airbags will deploy in the event of an impact
that exceeds the set threshold level (the level of force corresponding to the
impact force produced by an approximately 1500 kg [3300 lb.] vehicle collid-
ing with the vehicle cabin from a direction perpendicular to the vehicle orien-
tation at an approximate speed of 20 - 30 km/h [12 -18 mph]).

■Conditions under which the SRS airbags may deploy (inflate), other than

a collision
The  SRS  front  airbags  may  also  deploy  if  a  serious  impact  occurs  to  the
underside of your vehicle. Some examples are shown in the illustration.
●Hitting a curb, edge of pavement or hard

surface

●Falling into or jumping over a deep hole
●Landing hard or falling

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

1-1. For safe use

51

■Types of collisions that may not deploy the SRS airbags (SRS front air-

bags)
The SRS front airbags are generally not designed to inflate if the vehicle is
involved in a side or rear collision, if it rolls over, or if it is involved in a low-
speed frontal collision. But, whenever a collision of any type causes sufficient
forward deceleration of the vehicle, deployment of the SRS front airbags may
occur.
●Collision from the side
●Collision from the rear
●Vehicle rollover

■Types of collisions that may not deploy the SRS airbags 

(SRS side airbags and curtain shield airbags)
The SRS side airbag and curtain shield airbag system may not activate if the
vehicle is subjected to a collision from the side at certain angles, or a collision
to the side of the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment.
●Collision  from  the  side  to  the  vehicle
body other than the passenger compart-
ment

●Collision from the side at an angle

The SRS side airbags and curtain shield airbags are not generally designed
to inflate if the vehicle is involved in a frontal or rear collision, if it rolls over, or
if it is involved in a low-speed side collision.
●Collision from the front
●Collision from the rear
●Vehicle rollover

■Airbag manual off indicator

If any of the following problems occur, it is possible that there is a malfunction
in the system. Have the vehicle inspected by any authorized Toyota retailer or
Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.
●The indicator light does not come on when the airbag manual on-off switch

is switched to “OFF”.

●The indicator light does not go off when the airbag manual on-off switch is

switched to “ON”.

CAUTION

■When installing a child restraint system

For safety reasons, always install the child restraint system in a rear seat. In
the event that the rear seat cannot be used, the front seat can be used as
long as the airbag manual on-off system is set to “OFF”.
If the airbag manual on-off system is left on, the strong impact of the airbag
deployment (inflation) may cause serious injury or even death.

■When a child restraint system is not installed on the front passenger

seat
Ensure that the airbag manual on-off system is set to “ON”.
If it is left off, the airbag may not deploy in the event of an accident, which
may result in serious injury or even death.

Safety information for children

Observe the following precautions when children are in the vehi-
cle.
Use a child restraint system appropriate for the child, until the
child becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat
belt.

● It is recommended that children sit in the rear seats to avoid acci-

dental contact with the shift lever, wiper switch etc.

● Use the rear door child-protector lock or the window lock switch to
avoid  children  opening  the  door  while  driving  or  operating  the
power window accidentally.

● Do  not  let  small  children  operate  equipment  which  may  catch  or
pinch  body  parts,  such  as  the  power  window,  hood,  back  door,
seats etc.

CAUTION

Never leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to
have or use the key.
Children may be able  to start  the vehicle or  shift the vehicle into neutral.
There is also a danger that children may injure themselves by playing with
the windows, the moon roof (if equipped) or other features of the vehicle. In
addition,  heat  build-up  or  extremely  cold  temperatures  inside  the  vehicle
can be fatal to children.

Child restraint systems

Toyota strongly urges the use of child restraint systems.

Points to remember
Studies have shown that installing a child restraint on a rear seat is
much safer than installing one to the front passenger seat.
● Choose a child restraint system that suits your vehicle and is appro-

priate to the age and size of the child.

● For installation details, follow the instructions provided with the child

restraint system.
General installation instructions are provided in this manual. 
(→P. 70)

● If child restraint system regulations exist in the country where you
reside,  please  contact  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota
authorized  repairer,  or  any  reliable  repairer  for  the  child  restraint
system installation.

● Toyota  recommends  that  you  use  a  child  restraint  system  which

conforms to the regulation ECE No.44.

■When installing a child restraint system on the front passenger seat

When you have to use a child restraint system on the front passenger seat,
adjust the following:
●The  seatback  to  the  most  upright  posi-

tion

●The  seat  cushion  to  the  fully  rearward

position

■Selecting an appropriate child restraint system

●Use a child restraint system appropriate for the child until the child becomes

large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt.

●If the child is too large for a child restraint system, sit the child on a rear seat

and use the vehicle’s seat belt. (→P. 36)

CAUTION

■Using a child restraint system

The use of a child restraint system not suitable for the vehicle may not prop-
erly secure the infant or child. It may result in death or serious injury (in the
event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident).

■Child restraint precautions

●For effective protection in automobile accidents and sudden stops, a child
must  be  properly  restrained,  using  a  seat  belt  or  child  restraint  system
depending on the age and size of the child. Holding a child in your arms is
not a substitute for a child restraint system. In an accident, the child can be
crushed against the windshield, or between you and the vehicle’s interior.
●Toyota strongly urges the use of a proper child restraint system that con-
forms to the size of the child, installed on the rear seat. According to acci-
dent statistics, the child is safer when properly restrained in the rear seat
than in the front seat.

CAUTION

■Child restraint precautions

●Vehicles without airbag manual on-off switch: Never install a rear-facing

child restraint system on the front passenger seat.
In the event of an accident, the force of the rapid inflation of the front pas-
senger airbag can cause death or serious injury to the child.
Vehicles with airbag manual on-off switch: Never install a rear-facing child
restraint system on the front passenger seat when the airbag manual on-
off switch is on. (→P. 54)
In the event of an accident, the force of the rapid inflation of the front pas-
senger airbag can cause death or serious injury to the child.

●A forward-facing child restraint system may be installed on the front pas-
senger seat only when it is unavoidable. Always move the seat as far back
as possible, because the front passenger airbag could inflate with consid-
erable  speed  and  force.  Otherwise,  the  child  may  be  killed  or  seriously
injured.

●Do  not  allow  the  child  to  lean  his/her  head  or  any  part  of  his/her  body
against the door or the area of the seat, front, center and rear pillars or
roof side rail from which the SRS side airbags or SRS curtain shield air-
bags deploy even if the child is seated in the child restraint system. It is
dangerous if the SRS side airbags and curtain shield airbags inflate, and
the impact could cause death or serious injury to the child.

●Make sure you have complied with all installation instructions provided by
the child restraint manufacturer and that the system is properly secured. If
it is not secured properly, it may cause death or serious injury to the child
in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or accident.

■When children are in the vehicle

Do not  allow children  to play  with the  seat  belt.  If the  seat  belt  becomes
twisted around a child’s neck, it may lead to choking or other serious injuries
that could result in death.
If this occurs and the buckle cannot be unfastened, scissors should be used
to cut the belt.

■When the child restraint system is not in use

●Keep the child restraint system properly secured on the seat even if it is
not in use. Do not store the child restraint system unsecured in the pas-
senger compartment.

●If it is necessary to detach the child restraint system, remove it from the
vehicle or store it securely in the luggage compartment. This will prevent it
from injuring passengers in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or
accident.

CAUTION

■When installing a child restraint system

Follow the directions given in the child restraint system installation manual
and fix the child restraint system securely in place.
If the child restraint system is not correctly fixed in place, the child or other
passengers may be seriously injured or even killed in the event of sudden
braking, sudden swerving or an accident.
●If  the  driver’s  seat  interferes  with  the
child  restraint  system  and  prevents  it
from being attached correctly, attach the
child  restraint  system  to  the right-hand
second seat (left-hand drive vehicles) or
the  left-hand  second  seat  (right-hand
drive vehicles).

●Adjust the front passenger seat so that
it  does  not  interfere  with  the  child
restraint system.

●Child  restraint  system  installed  on  the  third  seat  should  not  contact  the

second seatbacks.

●Vehicles  without  an  airbag  manual  on-
off  switch:  Only  put  a  forward  facing
child restraint system on the front seat
when unavoidable. 
When  installing  a  forward-facing  child
restraint system on the front passenger
seat, move the seat as far back as pos-
sible.  Failing  to  do  so  may  result  in
death  or  serious  injury  if  the  airbags
deploy (inflate).

CAUTION

■When installing a child restraint system
●Vehicles  without  an  airbag  manual  on-
off  switch:  Never  install  a  rear-facing
child restraint system on the front pas-
senger seat.
The  force  of  the  rapid  inflation  of  the
front  passenger  airbag  can  cause
death or serious injury to children in the
event of an accident.

●Vehicles  with  an  airbag  manual  on-off
switch: Never install a rear-facing child
restraint system on the front passenger
seat  when  the  airbag  manual  on-off
switch is on. (→P. 54)
The  force  of  the  rapid  inflation  of  the
front  passenger  airbag  can  cause
death or serious injury to children in the
event of an accident.

●On some models: There is a label(s) on
the passenger side sun visor, indicating
it  is  forbidden  to  attach  a  rear-facing
child  restraint  system  to  the  front  pas-
senger seat.
Details of the label(s) are shown in the
illustration below.

CAUTION

■When installing a child restraint system

●If child restraint system regulations exist in the country where you reside,
please  contact  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer for the child restraint system installation.

●When installing a child restraint system on the second center seat, adjust
both seat cushions to the same position (vehicles with third manual/power
seats) and align both seatbacks at the same angle. The seatbacks must
be adjusted to the same angle. Otherwise, the child restraint system can-
not be securely restrained and this may cause death or serious injuries in
the event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident.

●When  a  junior  seat  is  installed,  always  ensure  that  the  shoulder  belt  is
positioned  across  the  center  of  the  child’s  shoulder.  The  belt  should  be
kept away from the child’s neck, but not so that it could fall off the child’s
shoulder. Failing to do so may result in death or serious injury in the event
of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident.

●Ensure that the belt and plate are securely locked and the seat belt is not

twisted.

●Shake the child restraint system left and right, and forward and backward

to ensure that it has been securely installed.

●After securing a child restraint system, never adjust the seat.
●Follow  all  installation  instructions  provided  by  the  child  restraint  system

manufacturer.

●When  using  the  left-hand  second  seat
(left-hand  drive  vehicles)  or  right-hand
second seat (right-hand drive vehicles)
for the child restraint system, do not sit
in the center second seat. 
Seat  belt  function  may  be  impaired,
such as being positioned overly high or
loose-fitting, which may result in death
or serious injury in the event of sudden
braking,  sudden  swerving  or  an  acci-
dent.

■To correctly attach a child restraint system to the anchors

When  using the  lower anchors, be  sure that  there are no  foreign objects
around  the  anchors  and  that  the  seat  belt  is  not  caught  behind  the  child
restraint system. Make sure the child restraint system is securely attached,
or it may cause death or serious injury to the child or other passengers in
the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or accident.

Exhaust gas precautions

Harmful  substance  to  the  human  body  is  included  in  exhaust
gases if inhale.

CAUTION

Exhaust gases include harmful carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless and
odorless. Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may cause exhaust gases enter the vehicle and may lead to
an accident caused by light-headedness, or may lead to death or a serious
health hazard.
■Important points while driving

●Keep the back door closed.
●If  you  smell  exhaust  gases  in  the  vehicle  even  when  the  back  door  is
closed, open the windows and have the vehicle inspected at any autho-
rized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer
as soon as possible.

■When parking

●If  the  vehicle  is  in  a  poorly  ventilated  area  or  a  closed  area,  such  as  a

garage, stop the engine.

●Do not leave the vehicle with the engine running for a long time.

If such a situation cannot be avoided, park the vehicle in an open space
and ensure that exhaust fumes do not enter the vehicle interior.

●Do not leave the engine running in an area with snow build-up, or where it
is snowing. If snowbanks build up around the vehicle while the engine is
running, exhaust gases may collect and enter the vehicle.

■Exhaust pipe

The exhaust system needs to be checked periodically. If there is a hole or
crack caused by corrosion, damage to a joint or abnormal exhaust noise, be
sure to have the vehicle inspected and repaired by any authorized Toyota
retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

• When the system is set to ON while the engine switch is in the “ON” posi-
tion  (vehicles  without  a  smart  entry  &  start  system)  or  IGNITION  ON
mode (vehicles with a smart entry & start system). 
If the system is functioning correctly, the BSM outside rear view mirror
indicators will turn off after a few seconds. 
If the BSM outside rear view mirror indicators do not illuminate or do not

CAUTION

■If a safety system warning light does not turn on

Should a safety system light such as ABS/Multi Terrain ABS and the SRS
warning light not turn on when you start the engine, this could mean that
these systems are not available to help protect you in an accident, which
could result in death or serious injury. Have the vehicle inspected by any
authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized  repairer,  or  any  reliable
repairer immediately if this occurs.

CAUTION

■The  multi-information  display  at  low  temperatures  (vehicles  with  an

automatic transmission)
Allow the interior of the vehicle to warm up before using the multi-informa-
tion  display.  At  extremely  low  temperatures,  the  multi-information  display
monitor may respond slowly, and display changes may be delayed.
For example, there is a lag between the driver’s shifting and the new gear
number appearing on the display. This lag could cause the driver to down-
shift  again,  causing  rapid  and  excessive  engine  braking  and  possibly  an
accident resulting in death or serious injury.

NOTICE

■The  multi-information  display  at  low  temperatures  (vehicles  with  a

manual transmission)
Allow the interior of the vehicle to warm up before using the multi-informa-
tion  display.  At  extremely  low  temperatures,  the  multi-information  display
monitor may respond slowly, and display changes may be delayed.

■If you lose your keys/wireless remote control

(cid:88) Keys
New genuine keys can be made by any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota
authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer using a master key (vehicles with-
out a smart entry & start system) or the other key (vehicles with a smart entry
& start system) and the key number stamped on your key number plate. Keep

When bringing a key with wireless remote control function onto an aircraft,
make sure you do not press any buttons on the key while inside the aircraft

CAUTION

■While driving

●Keep the back door closed while driving.

If the back door is left open, it may hit near-by objects while driving or lug-
gage may be unexpectedly thrown out, causing an accident.
In addition, exhaust gases may enter the vehicle, causing death or a seri-
ous health hazard. Make sure to close the back door before driving.

●Before driving the vehicle, make sure that the back door is fully closed. If
the back door is not fully closed, it may open unexpectedly while driving,
causing an accident.

●Never let anyone sit in the luggage compartment. In the event of sudden
braking, sudden swerving or a collision, they are susceptible to death or
serious injury.

■When children are in the vehicle
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
●Do not allow children to play in the luggage compartment.

If  a  child  is  accidentally  locked  in  the  luggage  compartment,  they  could
have heat exhaustion or other injuries.

●Do not allow a child to open or close the back door.

Doing so may cause the back door to move unexpectedly, or cause the
child’s hands, head, or neck to be caught by the closing back door.

■Operating the back door

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may cause parts of the body to be caught, resulting in death
or serious injury.
●When opening or closing the back door, thoroughly check to make sure

the surrounding area is safe.

●If anyone is in the vicinity, make sure they are safe and let them know that

the back door is about to open or close.

●Use caution when opening or closing the back door in windy weather as it

may move abruptly in strong wind.

CAUTION

■Operating the back door

●The back door may suddenly shut if the
back  door  stopper  is  not  locked.  It  is
more difficult to open or close the back
door on an incline than on a level sur-
face, so beware of the back door unex-
pectedly  opening  or  closing  by  itself.
Make sure that the back door stopper is
locked and secure before using the lug-
gage compartment.

●Even with the back door stopper locked, the back door stopper may unlock
and the back door may close when excessive force such as a strong wind
is applied to the back door. Take extra care to prevent any part of your
body from being caught.

●When closing the back door, take extra
care  to  prevent  your  fingers  etc.  from
being caught.

●When closing the back door, make sure
to press it lightly on its outer surface. If
the  back  door  handle  is  used  to  fully
close  the  back  door,  it  may  result  in
hands or arms being caught.

●Do not pull on the back door damper stay to close the back door, and do

not hang on the back door damper stay.
Doing so may cause hands to be caught or the back door damper stay to
break, causing an accident.

●If a bicycle carrier or similar heavy object is attached to the back door, it
may suddenly shut again after being opened, causing someone’s hands,
head or neck to be caught and injured. When installing an accessory part
to the back door, using a genuine Toyota part is recommended.

■Battery-saving function

The battery-saving function will be activated in order to prevent the electronic
key battery and the vehicle battery from being discharged while the vehicle is
not in operation for a long time.
●In the following situations, the smart entry & start system may take some

time to unlock the doors.
• The electronic key has been left in an area of approximately 2 m (6 ft.) of

the outside of the vehicle for 10 minutes or longer.

• The smart entry & start system has not been used for 5 days or longer.

●If the smart entry & start system has not been used for 14 days or longer,
the doors cannot be unlocked at any doors except the driver’s door. In this
case, take hold of the driver’s door handle, or use the wireless remote con-
trol or the mechanical key, to unlock the doors.

■Conditions affecting operation

The smart entry & start system uses weak radio waves. In the following situa-
tions, the communication between the electronic key and the vehicle may be
affected, preventing the smart entry & start system, wireless remote control
and engine immobilizer system from operating properly. 
(Ways of coping: →P. 691)
●When the electronic key battery is depleted
●Near a TV tower, electric power plant, gas station, radio station, large dis-
play, airport or other facility that generates strong radio waves or electrical
noise

●When  carrying  a  portable  radio,  cellular  phone,  cordless  phone  or  other

wireless communication device

●When  the electronic key  is  in  contact  with, or  is  covered by the  following

metallic objects
• Cards to which aluminum foil is attached
• Cigarette boxes that have aluminum foil inside
• Metallic wallets or bags
• Coins
• Hand warmers made of metal
• Media such as CDs and DVDs

●When multiple electronic keys are in the vicinity
●When other wireless keys (that emit radio waves) are being used nearby
●When  carrying  the  electronic  key  together  with  the  following  devices  that

emit radio waves
• Another vehicle’s electronic key or a wireless key that emits radio waves
• Personal computers or personal digital assistants (PDAs)
• Digital audio players

■Note for the entry function

●Even when the electronic key is within the effective range (detection areas),

the system may not operate properly in the following cases:
• The electronic key is too close to the window or outside door handle, near

the ground, or in a high place when the doors are locked or unlocked.

• The electronic key is near the ground or in a high place, or too close to

the rear bumper center when the glass hatch is opened.

• The electronic key is on the instrument panel, luggage cover or floor, or in
the door pockets or glove box when the engine is started or engine switch
modes are changed.

●Do not leave the electronic key on top of the instrument panel or near the
door pockets when exiting the vehicle. Depending on the radio wave recep-
tion conditions, it may be detected by the antenna outside the cabin and the
doors will become lockable from the outside, possibly trapping the electronic
key inside the vehicle.

●As long as the electronic key is within the effective range, the doors may be
locked or unlocked by anyone. However, only the doors detecting the elec-
tronic key can be used to unlock the vehicle.

●Even if the electronic key is not inside the vehicle, it may be possible to start

the engine if the electronic key is near the window.

●The doors may lock or unlock if a large amount of water splashes on the
door handle, such as in the rain or in a car wash, when the electronic key is
within  the  effective  range.  (The  doors  will  automatically  be  locked  after
approximately 30 seconds if the doors or the glass hatch are not opened
and closed.)

●If the wireless remote control is used to lock the doors when the electronic
key  is  near  the  vehicle,  there  is  a  possibility  that  the  door  may  not  be
unlocked by the entry function. (Use the wireless remote control to unlock
the doors.)

●Touching the door lock sensor while wearing gloves may prevent lock oper-

ation.

●If the door handle becomes wet while the electronic key is within the effec-
tive range, the door may lock and unlock repeatedly. Place the electronic
key in a location 2 m (6 ft.) or more away from the vehicle. (Take care to
ensure that the key is not stolen.)

●If the electronic key is inside the vehicle and a door handle becomes wet
during a car wash, a message may be shown on the multi-information dis-
play and a buzzer will sound outside the vehicle. To turn off the alarm, lock
all the doors.

snow, mud, etc. Clean the lock sensor and attempt to operate it again, or
use the lock sensor on the lower part of the door handle.

●Fingernails may scrape against the door during operation of the door han-

dle. Be careful not to injure fingernails or damage the surface of the door.

●A sudden approach to the effective range or door handle may prevent the
doors from being unlocked. In this case, return the door handle to the origi-
nal position and check that the doors unlock before pulling the door handle
again.

●Unlocking the vehicle may take more time if another electronic key is within

the effective range.

■When the vehicle is not driven for extended periods

●To prevent theft of the vehicle, do not leave the electronic key within 2 m (6

ft.) of the vehicle.

●The smart entry & start system can be deactivated in advance. (→P. 741)

■To operate the system properly

Make sure to carry the electronic key when operating the system. Do not get
the electronic key too close to the vehicle when operating the system from the
outside of the vehicle.
Depending on the position and holding condition of the electronic key, the key
may not be detected correctly and the system may not operate properly. (The
alarm may go off accidentally, or the door lock prevention function may not
operate.)

■If the smart entry & start system does not operate properly

■Electronic key battery depletion

●The standard battery life is 1 to 2 years.
●If the battery becomes low, an alarm will sound in the cabin when the engine

stops. (→P. 160, 651)

●As the electronic key always receives radio waves, the battery will become
depleted even if the electronic key is not used. The following symptoms indi-
cate that the electronic key battery may be depleted. Replace the battery
when necessary. (→P. 588)
• The smart entry & start system or the wireless remote control does not

operate.

• The detection area becomes smaller.

CAUTION

■When adjusting the seat position

●Take care when adjusting the seat position to ensure that other passen-

gers are not injured by the moving seat.

●Do not put your hands under the seat or near the moving parts to avoid

injury. 
Fingers or hands may become jammed in the seat mechanism.

■Seat adjustment

●To reduce the risk of sliding under the lap belt during a collision, do not

recline the seat more than necessary.
If the seat is too reclined, the lap belt may slide past the hips and apply
restraint  forces  directly  to  the  abdomen,  or  your  neck  may  contact  the
shoulder belt, increasing the risk of death or serious injury in the event of
an accident.
Adjustments should not be made while driving as the seat may unexpect-
edly move and cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

●After  adjusting  the  seat,  make  sure  that  the  seat  is  locked  in  position.

tem)
The  hill-start  assist  control  is  available.  (→Refer  to  the  “Off-road  Driving
Owner’s Manual”)
■Driving in the rain

●Drive carefully when it is raining, because visibility will be reduced, the win-

dows may become fogged-up, and the road will be slippery.

●Drive carefully when it starts to rain, because the road surface will be espe-

cially slippery.

●Refrain  from  high  speeds  when  driving  on  an  expressway  in  the  rain,
because there may be a layer of water between the tires and the road sur-
face, preventing the steering and brakes from operating properly.

■Engine speed while driving (automatic transmission)

In the following conditions, the engine speed may become high while driving.
This is due to automatic up-shifting control or down-shifting implementation to
meet driving conditions. It does not indicate sudden acceleration.
●The vehicle is judged to be driving uphill or downhill

Avoid sudden stops.

●For the first 800 km (500 miles):

Do not tow a trailer.

●For the first 1000 km (600 miles):

• Do not drive at extremely high speeds.
• Avoid sudden acceleration.
• Do not drive continuously in the low gears.
• Do not drive at a constant speed for extended periods.
• Do not drive slowly with the manual transmission in a high gear.

■Drum-in-disc type parking brake system

Your vehicle has a drum-in-disc type parking brake system.
This type of brake system needs bedding-down of the brake shoes periodi-
cally or whenever the parking brake shoes and/or drum are replaced.
Have any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reli-
able repairer perform the bedding-down operation.

erator pedals to avoid depressing the wrong pedal. 
• Accidentally  depressing  the  accelerator  pedal  instead  of  the  brake

pedal will result in sudden acceleration that may lead to an accident.

• When backing up, you may twist your body around, leading to a diffi-
culty in operating the pedals. Make sure to operate the pedals properly.
• Make  sure  to  keep  a  correct  driving  posture  even  when  moving  the
vehicle only slightly. This allows you to depress the brake and accelera-
tor pedals properly.

• Depress  the  brake  pedal  using  your  right  foot.  Depressing  the  brake
pedal using your left foot may delay response in an emergency, result-
ing in an accident.

●Do not drive the vehicle over or stop the vehicle near flammable materials.
The exhaust system and exhaust gases can be extremely hot. These hot
parts may cause a fire if there is any flammable material nearby.

CAUTION

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■When driving the vehicle

●During normal driving, do not turn off the engine. Turning the engine off
while  driving  will  not  cause  loss  of  steering  or  braking  control,  but  the
power assist to these systems will be lost. This will make it more difficult to
steer and brake, so you should pull over and stop the vehicle as soon as it
is safe to do so.
However, in the event of an emergency, such as if it becomes impossible
to stop the vehicle in the normal way: →P. 615

●Use  engine  braking  (downshift)  to  maintain  a  safe  speed  when  driving

down a steep hill.
Using the brakes continuously may cause the brakes to overheat and lose
effectiveness. (→P. 258)

●Do not adjust the positions of the steering wheel, the seat, or the inside or

outside rear view mirrors while driving.
Doing so may result in a loss of vehicle control.

●Always check that all passengers’ arms, heads or other parts of their body

are not outside the vehicle.

CAUTION

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■When driving on slippery road surfaces

●Sudden  braking,  acceleration  and  steering  may  cause  tire  slippage  and

reduce your ability to control the vehicle.

●Sudden acceleration, engine braking due to shifting, or changes in engine

speed could cause the vehicle to skid.

●After  driving  through  a  puddle,  lightly  depress  the  brake  pedal  to  make
sure that the brakes are functioning properly. Wet brake pads may prevent
the brakes from functioning properly. If the brakes on only one side are wet
and not functioning properly, steering control may be affected.

■When shifting the shift lever

●On  vehicles  with  an  automatic  transmission,  do  not  let  the  vehicle  roll
backwards while the shift lever is in a driving position, or roll forward while
the shift lever is in R.
Doing so may cause the engine to stall or lead to poor brake and steering
performance, resulting in an accident or damage to the vehicle.

●On vehicles with an automatic transmission, do not shift the shift lever to P

while the vehicle is moving.
Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle
control.

●Do not shift the shift lever to R while the vehicle is moving forward.

Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle
control.

●Do not shift the shift lever to a driving position while the vehicle is moving

backward.
Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle
control.

●Moving the shift lever to N while the vehicle is moving will disengage the

engine from the transmission.
Engine braking is not available when N is selected.

●On vehicles with an automatic transmission, be careful not to shift the shift
lever  with  the  accelerator  pedal  depressed.  Shifting  the  shift  lever  to  a
gear other than P or N may lead to unexpected rapid acceleration of the
vehicle that may cause an accident and result in death or serious injury.

4-1. Before driving

225

CAUTION

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■If you hear a squealing or scraping noise (brake pad wear indicators)
Have  the  brake  pads  checked  and  replaced  by  any  authorized  Toyota
retailer  or  Toyota  authorized  repairer,  or  any  reliable  repairer  as  soon  as
possible.
Rotor damage may result if the pads are not replaced when needed.
It is dangerous to drive the vehicle when the wear limits of the brake pads
and/or those of the brake discs are exceeded.

■When the vehicle is stopped

●Do not race the engine.

If the vehicle is in any gear other than P (vehicles with an automatic trans-
mission only) or N, the vehicle may accelerate suddenly and unexpectedly,
causing an accident.

●On vehicles with automatic transmission, in order to prevent accidents due
to the vehicle rolling away, always keep depressing the brake pedal while
the engine is running, and apply the parking brake as necessary.

●If the vehicle is stopped on an incline, in order to prevent accidents caused
by the vehicle rolling forward or backward, always depress the brake pedal
and securely apply the parking brake as needed.

●Avoid revving or racing the engine.

Running the engine at high speed while the vehicle is stopped may cause
the exhaust system to overheat, which could result in a fire if combustible
material is nearby.

●Do not leave glasses, cigarette lighters, spray cans, or soft drink cans in

the vehicle when it is in the sun.
Doing so may result in the following:
• Gas may leak from a cigarette lighter or spray can, and may lead to a

• The temperature inside the vehicle may cause the plastic lenses and

plastic material of glasses to deform or crack.

• Soft  drink  cans  may  fracture,  causing  the  contents  to  spray  over  the
interior of the vehicle, and may also cause a short circuit in the vehicle’s
electrical components.

●Do not leave cigarette lighters in the vehicle. If a cigarette lighter is in a
place such as the glove box or on the floor, it may be lit accidentally when
luggage is loaded or the seat is adjusted, causing a fire.

●Do not attach adhesive discs to the windshield or windows. Do not place
containers such as air fresheners on the instrument panel or dashboard.
Adhesive discs or containers may act as lenses, causing a fire in the vehi-
cle.

●Do not leave a door or window open if the curved glass is coated with a
metallized film such as a silver-colored one. Reflected sunlight may cause
the glass to act as a lens, causing a fire.

●Always apply the parking brake, shift the shift lever to P (vehicles with an

automatic transmission only), stop the engine and lock the vehicle.
Do not leave the vehicle unattended while the engine is running.
If the vehicle is parked with the shift lever in P but the parking brake is not
set, the vehicle may start to move, possibly leading to an accident.

●Do not touch the exhaust pipes while the engine is running or immediately

after turning the engine off. 
Doing so may cause burns.

CAUTION

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■When taking a nap in the vehicle

Always  turn  the  engine  off.  Otherwise,  if  you  accidentally  move  the  shift
lever or depress the accelerator pedal, this could cause an accident or fire
due to engine overheating. Additionally, if the vehicle is parked in a poorly
ventilated area, exhaust gases may collect and enter the vehicle, leading to
death or a serious health hazard.

■When braking

●When the brakes are wet, drive more cautiously.

Braking distance increases when the brakes are wet, and this may cause
one side of the vehicle to brake differently than the other side. Also, the
parking brake may not securely hold the vehicle.

●If  the power brake  assist function  does not  operate, do  not follow  other
vehicles closely and avoid hills or sharp turns that require braking. In this
case,  braking is still possible, but the brake  pedal should  be depressed
more firmly than usual. Also, the braking distance will increase. Have your
brakes fixed immediately.

●Do not pump the brake pedal if the engine stalls. 

Each push on the brake pedal uses up the reserve for the power-assisted
brakes.

●The brake system consists of 2 individual hydraulic systems: If one of the
systems  fails,  the  other  will  still  operate.  In  this  case,  the  brake  pedal
should be depressed more firmly than usual and the braking distance will
increase.
Have your brakes fixed immediately.

■If the vehicle becomes stuck

Do not spin the wheels excessively when any of the tires is up in the air, or
the vehicle is stuck in sand, mud, etc. This may damage the driveline com-
ponents or propel the vehicle forward or backward, causing an accident.

Failure  to  do  so  may  prevent  the  pedals  from  being  depressed  properly,
may block the driver’s vision, or may result in items hitting the driver or pas-
sengers, possibly causing an accident.
●Stow cargo and luggage in the luggage compartment whenever possible.
●Do not stack anything in the luggage compartment higher than the seat-

backs.

●Do not place cargo or luggage in or on the following locations.

• At the feet of the driver
• On the front passenger or rear seats (when stacking items)
• On the luggage cover (if equipped)
• On the instrument panel
• On the dashboard

●Secure all items in the occupant compartment.
●When  you  fold  down  the  rear  seats,  long  items  should  not  be  placed

directly behind the front seats.

●Never allow anyone to ride in the luggage compartment. It is not designed
for passengers. They should ride in their seats with their seat belts prop-
erly fastened. Otherwise, they are much more likely to suffer death or seri-
ous bodily injury, in the event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an
accident.

■Roof luggage carrier precautions (if equipped)

To use the roof rails as a roof luggage carrier, you must fit the roof rails with
two or more genuine Toyota cross rails or their equivalent. 
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and precautions when installing the
cross rails or their equivalent.
When you load cargo on the roof luggage carrier, observe the following:
●Place the cargo so that its weight is distributed evenly between the front

and rear axles.

●If loading long or wide cargo, never exceed the vehicle overall length or

width. (→P. 708)

●Before driving, make sure the cargo is securely fastened on the roof lug-

gage carrier.

●Loading cargo on the roof luggage carrier will make the center of gravity of
the vehicle higher. Avoid high speeds, sudden starts, sharp turns, sudden
braking or abrupt maneuvers, otherwise it may result in loss of control or
vehicle rollover due to failure to operate this vehicle correctly and result in
death or serious injury.

●If driving for a long distance, on rough roads, or at high speeds, stop the
vehicle now and then during the trip to make sure the cargo remains in its
place.

●Do not exceed 80 kg (176 lb.) cargo weight on the roof luggage carrier.

Trailer towing (with towing hitch)∗

Your vehicle is designed primarily as a passenger-and-load-car-
rying vehicle. Towing a trailer will have an adverse effect on han-
dling,  performance,  braking,  durability,  and  fuel  consumption.
Your safety and satisfaction depend on the proper use of correct
equipment and cautious driving habits. For your safety and the
safety of others, do not overload the vehicle or trailer.
To tow a trailer safely, use extreme care and drive the vehicle in
accordance with the trailer’s characteristics and operating con-
ditions.
Toyota  warranties  do  not  apply  to  damage  or  malfunction
caused by towing a trailer for commercial purposes.
Ask  your  local  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer for further details before towing,
as there are additional legal requirements in some countries.

◆ Weight limits

Check the allowable towing capacity, GVM (Gross Vehicle Mass),
MPAC  (Maximum  Permissible  Axle  Capacity),  and  permissible
drawbar load before towing. (→P. 708)

◆ Towing hitch/bracket

Toyota  recommends  the  use  of  the  Toyota  hitch/bracket  for  your
vehicle. Other products of a suitable nature and comparable quality
may also be used.

◆ To prevent an accident

The handling of the vehicle will feel different when towing a trailer.
Beware of the 3 most common causes of towing-related accidents:
driver error, excessive speed, and overloading.

Important points regarding trailer loads
■ Total trailer weight and permissible drawbar load

1

2

Total trailer weight
Weight  of  the  trailer  itself  plus
the trailer load should be within
the  maximum  towing  capacity.
Exceeding this weight is danger-
ous. (→P. 708)
When towing a trailer, use a fric-
tion  coupler  or  friction  stabilizer
(sway control device).
When  the  total  trailer  weight  is
over  2000  kg  (4409  lb.),  a  fric-
tion  stabilizer 
(sway  control
device) is required.
Permissible drawbar load
Allocate the trailer load so that the drawbar load is greater than 25 kg
(55.1  lb.)  or  4  %  of  the  towing  capacity.  Do  not  let  the  drawbar  load
exceed the indicated weight. (→P. 708)

Gross vehicle mass
The combined weight of the driver, passengers, luggage, towing hitch,
total curb mass and drawbar load should not exceed the gross vehicle
mass by more than 100 kg (220.5 lb.). Exceeding this weight is danger-
ous.
Maximum permissible rear axle capacity
The weight borne by the rear axle should not exceed the maximum per-
missible axle capacity by 15 % or more. Exceeding this weight is dan-
gerous.

The values for towing capacity were derived from testing conducted
at sea level. Take note that engine output and towing capacity will
be reduced at high altitudes.

■Tire information

●Increase  the  tire  inflation  pressure  to  20.0  kPa  (0.2  kgf/cm2  or  bar,  3  psi)

greater than the recommended value when towing. (→P. 735)

●Increase  the  air  pressure  of  the  trailer  tires  in  accordance  with  the  total
trailer weight and according to the values recommended by the manufac-
turer of your trailer.

■Trailer lights

Check that the turn signal lights and stoplights are operating correctly every
time you hitch up the trailer. Directly wiring up to your vehicle may damage
the electrical system and stop the lights from functioning correctly.

■Break-in schedule

Toyota  recommends  that  vehicles  fitted  with  new  power  train  components
should not be used for towing trailers for the first 800 km (500 miles).

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

4-1. Before driving

241

■Safety checks before towing

●Check that the maximum load limit for the towing hitch/bracket hitch ball is
not exceeded. Bear in mind that the coupling weight of the trailer will add to
the load exerted on the vehicle. Also make sure that the total load exerted
on the vehicle is within the range of the weight limits. (→P. 235)

●Ensure that the trailer load is secure.
●Supplementary outside rear view mirrors should be added to the vehicle if
the traffic behind cannot be clearly seen with standard mirrors. Adjust the
extending arms of these mirrors on both sides of the vehicle so that they
always provide maximum visibility of the road behind.

■Maintenance

●Maintenance must be performed more frequently when using the vehicle for
towing due to the greater weight burden placed on the vehicle compared to
normal driving.

●Retighten  all  bolts  securing  the  hitching  ball  and  bracket  after  towing  for

approximately 1000 km (600 miles).

■If trailer sway occurs

One  or  more  factors  (crosswinds,  passing  vehicles,  rough  roads,  etc.)  can
adversely affect handling of your vehicle and trailer, causing instability.
●If trailer swaying occurs:

• Firmly grip the steering wheel. Steer straight ahead.

Do not try to control trailer swaying by turning the steering wheel.

• Begin releasing the accelerator pedal immediately but very gradually to

reduce speed.
Do not increase speed. Do not apply vehicle brakes.

If you make no extreme correction with the steering or brakes, your vehicle
and trailer should stabilize (if enabled, Trailer Sway Control can also help to
stabilize the vehicle and trailer.).

●After the trailer swaying has stopped:

• Stop in a safe place. Get all occupants out of the vehicle.
• Check the tires of the vehicle and the trailer.
• Check the load in the trailer.

Make sure the load has not shifted.
Make sure the tongue weight is appropriate, if possible.

• Check the load in the vehicle.

Make sure the vehicle is not overloaded after occupants get in.

If  you  cannot  find  any  problems,  the  speed  at  which  trailer  swaying
occurred is beyond the limit of your particular vehicle-trailer combination.
Drive at a lower speed to prevent instability. Remember that swaying of the
towing vehicle-trailer increases as speed increases.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

4-1. Before driving

CAUTION

■To avoid accident or injury

●Vehicles with the rear height control air suspension: 

Set the vehicle height to the low mode and turn off the rear height control
air suspension to prevent the vehicle height from automatically changing.

●Vehicles with the emergency tire puncture repair kit:

Do not tow a trailer when the tire installed is repaired with the emergency
tire puncture repair kit.

NOTICE

■When the rear bumper strengthening material is aluminum

Ensure  the  steel  bracket  part  does  not  come  directly  in  contact  with  that
area.
When steel and aluminum come into contact, there is a reaction similar to
corrosion, which will weaken the section concerned and may result in dam-
age. Apply a rust inhibitor to parts that will come in contact when attaching a
steel bracket.

243

Guidance
Your vehicle will handle differently when towing a trailer. In order to
avoid  accident,  death  or  serious  injury,  keep  the  following  in  mind
when towing:
■ Checking connections between trailer and lights

Stop the vehicle and check the operation of the connection between
the trailer and lights after driving for a brief period as well as before
starting off.

■ Practicing driving with a coupled trailer

● Get  the  feel  for  turning,  stopping  and  reversing  with  the  trailer

coupled by practicing in an area with no or light traffic.

● When  reversing  with  a  coupled  trailer,  hold  the  section  of  the
steering  wheel  nearest  to  you  and  rotate  clockwise  to  turn  the
trailer left or counterclockwise to turn it right. Always rotate a little
at  a  time  to  prevent  steering  error.  Have  someone  guide  you
when reversing to lessen the risk of accident.

■ Increasing vehicle-to-vehicle distance

At a speed of 10 km/h (6 mph), the distance to the vehicle running
ahead of you should be equivalent to or greater than the combined
length  of your vehicle  and  trailer. Avoid sudden  braking  that  may
cause skidding. Otherwise, the vehicle may spin out of control. This
is especially true when driving on wet or slippery road surfaces.

■ Sudden acceleration/steering input/cornering

Executing sharp turns when towing may result in the trailer colliding
with  your  vehicle.  Decelerate  well  in  advance  when  approaching
turns and take them slowly and carefully to avoid sudden braking.

■ Important points regarding turning

The wheels of the trailer will travel closer to the inside of the curve
than the wheels of the vehicle. To make allowance for this, take the
turns wider than you would normally do.

4-1. Before driving

■ Important points regarding stability

Vehicle movement resulting from uneven road surfaces and strong
crosswinds will affect handling. The vehicle may also be rocked by
passing buses or large trucks. Frequently check behind when mov-
ing  alongside  such  vehicles.  As  soon  as  such  vehicle  movement
occurs, immediately start to decelerate smoothly by slowly applying
the brakes. Always steer the vehicle straight ahead while braking.

■ Passing other vehicles

Consider the total combined length of your vehicle and trailer and
ensure that the vehicle-to-vehicle distance is sufficient before exe-
cuting lane changes.

■ Transmission information

Refrain from driving in the 6th gear (6-speed manual transmission)
or 5th gear (5-speed manual transmission), 5 or 6 range in S mode
to  maintain  the  effectiveness of  the  engine  brake and the  charge
performance of electrical components.

■ If the engine overheats

Towing  a  loaded  trailer  up  a  long,  steep  incline  in  temperatures
exceeding 30°C (85°F) may result in the engine overheating. If the
engine coolant temperature gauge indicates that the engine is over-
heating, turn the air conditioning off immediately, leave the road and
stop the vehicle in a safe place. (→P. 701)

■ When parking the vehicle

Always place  wheel chocks  under  the  wheels  of both the  vehicle
and trailer. Firmly set the parking brake and shift the shift lever to P
for automatic transmissions, and 1 or R for manual transmissions.

4-1. Before driving

245

CAUTION

Follow  all  the  precautions  described  in  this  section.  Failure  to  do  so  could
cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury.
■Trailer towing precautions

●When towing, make sure that none of the weight limits are exceeded. 

(→P. 235)

●Do not use cruise control (if equipped) or dynamic radar cruise control (if

equipped) when trailer towing.

■Vehicle speed in towing

Observe the legal maximum speeds for trailer towing.

■Before descending hills or long declines

Reduce speed and downshift. Never downshift abruptly.

■Operation of the brake pedal

Do not hold the brake pedal depressed often or for long periods of time. 
Doing so may result in the brake overheating or reduce braking effects.

NOTICE

■For vehicles with an emergency tire puncture repair kit (if equipped)

Do not tow anything if a tire that has been repaired using the emergency tire
puncture repair kit is installed. The load on the tire may cause unexpected
damage to the tire.

■Do not directly splice trailer lights

Directly splicing trailer lights may damage your vehicle’s electrical system
and cause a malfunction.

(→P. 261)
■ Shift ranges and their functions

● You can choose from 5 (5-speed models) or 6 (6-speed models)

levels of engine braking force.

● A lower shift range will provide greater engine braking force than

a higher shift range, and the engine speed will also increase.

■Driving on a downhill

On declines, there may be case where the vehicle shifts down automatically
to obtain engine braking. As a result of the downshifting, the engine speed
may increase.

■Second start mode automatic deactivation

Second start mode is automatically deactivated if the engine is turned off after
driving in second start mode. 

■S mode

When the shift range is 4 or lower, holding the shift lever toward “+” sets the
shift range to 5 (5-speed models) or 6 (6-speed models).

■AI-SHIFT

AI-SHIFT  automatically  selects  a  suitable  gear  according  to  driver  perfor-
mance and driving conditions.
AI-SHIFT  automatically  operates  when  the  shift  lever  is  in  the  D  position.
(Shifting the shift lever to the S position cancels the function.)

■When driving with the cruise control or dynamic radar cruise control (if

equipped)
Engine braking will not occur in S mode, even when downshifting to 4 or 5.

■If the “S” indicator does not come on even after shifting the shift lever to

S
This may indicate a malfunction in the automatic transmission system. Have
the vehicle inspected by any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer immediately.

■Downshift restriction warning buzzer (S mode)

To help ensure safety and driving performance, downshifting operation may
sometimes  be  restricted.  In  some  circumstances,  downshifting  may  not  be
possible even when the shift lever is operated. (A buzzer will sound twice.)

■Transmission protection function (6-speed models)

If the tires spin continually when the vehicle becomes stuck in mud, dirt or
snow, or if the accelerator pedal is depressed and released repeatedly while
driving, the  automatic transmission  temperature  may  become  too  high and
the automatic transmission may be damaged. 
To avoid damaging the automatic transmission, the system may temporarily
lock the gear. 
If the automatic transmission temperature falls, the gear locking is canceled
and the automatic transmission is returned to the normal operation.

CAUTION

■When driving on slippery road surfaces
Do not accelerate or shift gears suddenly. 
Sudden changes in engine braking may cause the vehicle to spin or skid,
resulting in an accident.

■To prevent an accident when releasing the shift lock

Before pressing the shift lock override button, make sure to set the parking
brake and depress the brake pedal.
If the accelerator pedal is accidentally depressed instead of the brake pedal

(cid:88) Vehicles with a smart entry & start system
The engine switch is in IGNITION ON mode.

■Raindrop sensor (vehicles with rain-sensing windshield wipers)

●The raindrop sensor judges the amount

of raindrops.
An optical sensor is adopted. It may not
operate properly when sunlight from the
rising or setting of the sun intermittently
strikes the windshield, or if bugs etc. are
present on the windshield.

●If the wiper switch is turned to the “AUTO” position while the engine switch is
in IGNITION ON mode, the wipers will operate once to show that “AUTO”
mode is activated.

●When  the  sensor  sensitivity  ring  is  turned  toward  high  while  in  “AUTO”
mode, the wipers will operate once to indicate that the sensor sensitivity is
enhanced.

●If the temperature of the raindrop sensor is 90°C (194°F) or higher, or -15°C
(5°F) or lower, automatic operation may not occur. In this case, operate the
wipers in any mode other than “AUTO”.

■Effects of vehicle speed on wiper operation (vehicles with rain-sensing

windshield wipers)
With the settings other than “AUTO” also, the time until drip prevention wiper
sweep occurs is changed depending on vehicle speed.
With the low speed operation selected, wiper operation will be switched from
low speed to intermittent wiper operation only when the vehicle is stationary.
(However,  when  the  sensor  sensitivity  is  adjusted  to  the  highest  level,  the
mode cannot be switched.)

fingers or anything else does not become caught in the windshield wipers.

■Caution regarding the use of washer fluid

When it is cold, do not use the washer fluid until the windshield becomes
warm. The fluid may freeze on the windshield and cause low visibility. This
may lead to an accident, resulting in death or serious injury.

NOTICE

■When the windshield is dry

Do not use the wipers, as they may damage the windshield.

■When the washer fluid tank is empty

Do not operate the switch continually as the washer fluid pump may over-
heat.

■When there is no washer fluid spray from the nozzle

Damage  to  the  washer  fluid  pump  may  be  caused  if  the  lever  is  pulled
toward you and held continually.

■When a nozzle becomes blocked

Do not try to clear it with a pin or other object. The nozzle will be damaged.

CAUTION

■When refueling the vehicle

Observe the following precautions while refueling the vehicle. Failure to do
so may result in death or serious injury.
●After  exiting  the  vehicle  and  before  opening  the  fuel  door,  touch  an
unpainted metal surface to discharge any static electricity. It is important to
discharge static electricity before refueling because sparks resulting from
static electricity can cause fuel vapors to ignite while refueling.

●Always hold the grips on the fuel tank cap and turn it slowly to remove it. 
A  whooshing  sound  may  be  heard  when  the  fuel  tank  cap  is  loosened.
Wait until the sound cannot be heard before fully removing the cap. In hot
weather, pressurized fuel may spray out the filler neck and cause injury.

●Do not allow anyone  that has not  discharged  static  electricity  from their

body to come close to an open fuel tank.

●Do not inhale vaporized fuel.

Fuel contains substances that are harmful if inhaled.

●Do not smoke while refueling the vehicle.

Doing so may cause the fuel to ignite and cause a fire.

●Do not return to the vehicle or touch any person or object that is statically

charged.
This may cause static electricity to build up, resulting in a possible ignition
hazard.

Example of constant speed cruising
When there are no vehicles ahead
The vehicle travels at the speed set by the driver. The desired vehi-
cle-to-vehicle distance can also be set by operating the vehicle-to-
vehicle distance control.
Example of deceleration cruising
When the vehicle ahead is driving slower than the set speed
When a vehicle is detected running ahead of you the system auto-
matically  decelerates  your  vehicle.  When  a  greater  reduction  in
vehicle speed is necessary, the system applies the brakes. A warn-
ing tone warns you when the system cannot decelerate sufficiently
to prevent your vehicle from closing in on the vehicle ahead.
Example of follow-up cruising 
When following a vehicle driving slower than the set speed
The  system  continues  follow-up  cruising  while  adjusting  for
changes in the speed of the vehicle ahead in order to maintain the
vehicle-to-vehicle distance set by the driver.
Example of acceleration 
When there are no longer are vehicles ahead driving slower than
the set speed
The system accelerates until the set speed is reached. The system
then returns to constant speed cruising.

lowing situations:
●Actual vehicle speed falls below approximately 40 km/h (25 mph).
●VSC is activated.
●The sensor cannot operate correctly because it is covered in some way.
●The windshield wipers are operating at high speed (when the wiper switch is

set to the “AUTO” mode or the high speed wiper operation position).

●When second start mode is set.
●Bad weather causes the detection function to become extremely unstable.
If vehicle-to-vehicle distance control driving is automatically canceled for any
other reason, there may be a malfunction in the system. Contact any autho-
rized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

■Before using dynamic radar cruise control

Do not overly rely on vehicle-to-vehicle distance control. 
Be  aware  of  the  set  speed.  If  automatic  deceleration/acceleration  is  not
appropriate, adjust the vehicle speed, as well as the distance between your
vehicle and vehicles ahead by applying the brakes etc.

■Cautions regarding the driving assist systems

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury.
●Assisting the driver to measure following distance

The  dynamic  radar  cruise  control  is  only  intended  to  help  the  driver  in
determining the following distance between the driver’s own vehicle and a
designated vehicle traveling ahead. It is not a mechanism that allows care-
less or inattentive driving, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in
low-visibility conditions. It is still necessary for driver to pay close attention
to the vehicle’s surroundings.

●Assisting the driver to judge proper following distance

The  dynamic  radar  cruise  control  determines  whether  the  following  dis-
tance between the driver’s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling
ahead is appropriate or not. It is not capable of making any other type of
judgement. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the driver to remain
vigilant and to determine whether or not there is a possibility of danger in
any given situation.

●Assisting the driver to operate the vehicle

The dynamic radar cruise control has no capability to prevent or avoid a
collision with a vehicle traveling ahead. Therefore, if there is ever any dan-
ger, the driver must take immediate and direct control of the vehicle and
act appropriately in order to ensure the safety of all involved.

■To avoid inadvertent cruise control activation

Switch the cruise control off using the “ON-OFF” button when not in use.

■ Buzzer operation and distance to an obstacle
A buzzer sounds when the sensors are operating.
● The buzzer sounds faster as the vehicle approaches an obstacle. 
When  the  vehicle  comes  within  the  following  distance  of  the
obstacle, the buzzer sounds continuously.
• Front corner sensors: Approximately 30 cm (1.0 ft.)
• Front center sensors: Approximately 30 cm (1.0 ft.)
• Rear corner sensors: Approximately 25 cm (0.8 ft.)
• Rear center sensors: Approximately 40 cm (1.3 ft.)

● When  2  or  more  obstacles  are  detected  simultaneously,  the
buzzer system responds to the nearest obstacle. If one or both
come  within  the  above  distances,  the  beep  will  repeat  a  long
tone, followed by fast beeps.

■Sensor detection information

●The sensor’s detection areas are limited to the areas around the vehicle’s

bumper.

●Certain vehicle conditions and the surrounding environment may affect the
ability of a sensor to correctly detect an obstacle. Particular instances where
this may occur are listed below.
• There is dirt, snow or ice on the sensor. (Wiping the sensors will resolve

this problem.)

• The sensor is frozen. (Thawing the area will resolve this problem.)
• The sensor is covered in any way.
• The vehicle is leaning considerably to one side.
• On an extremely bumpy road, on an incline, on gravel, or on grass.
• The  vicinity  of  the  vehicle  is  noisy  due  to  vehicle  horns,  motorcycle
engines, air brakes of large vehicles, or other loud noises producing ultra-
sonic waves.

• There  is  another  vehicle  equipped  with  parking  assist  sensors  in  the

vicinity.

• The sensor is coated with a sheet of spray or heavy rain.
• The vehicle is equipped with a fender pole or wireless antenna.
• Towing eyelets are installed.
• The bumper or sensor receives a strong impact.
• The vehicle is approaching a tall or curved curb.
• In harsh sunlight or intense cold weather.
• The area directly under the bumpers is not detected.
• If obstacles draw too close to the sensor.
• A non-genuine Toyota suspension (lowered suspension etc.) is installed.
• When attaching a two-way radio (RF-transmitter) antenna.
• People may not be detected if they are wearing certain types of clothing.
In addition to the examples above, there are instances in which, because of
their shape, signs and other objects may be judged by a sensor to be closer
than they are.

●The shape of the obstacle may prevent a sensor from detecting it. Pay par-

ticular attention to the following obstacles:
• Wires, fences, ropes, etc.
• Cotton, snow and other materials that absorb sound waves
• Sharply-angled objects
• Low obstacles
• Tall obstacles with upper sections projecting outwards in the direction of

your vehicle

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

332

4-5. Using the driving support systems

●The following situations may occur during use:

• Depending on the shape of the obstacle and other factors, the detection

distance may shorten, or detection may be impossible.

• Obstacles may not be detected if they are too close to the sensor.
• There  will  be  a  short  delay  between  obstacle  detection  and  indicator.
Even  at  slow  speeds,  there  is  a  possibility  that  the  obstacle  will  come
within the sensor’s detection areas before the indicator comes on and the
warning beep sounds.

• Thin posts or objects lower than the sensor may not be detected when

approached, even if they have been detected once.

• It might be difficult to hear beeps due to the volume of audio system or air

flow noise of the air conditioning system.

■When the system malfunctions

(cid:88) Vehicles with a Toyota parking assist-sensor indicator
●If the vehicle indicator remains on while the rear corner and rear center indi-
cators flash and the malfunction beep sounds for approximately 8 seconds,

● Using the camera

If dirt or foreign matter (such as water droplets, snow, mud etc.)
is  adhering  to  the  camera,  it  cannot  transmit  a  clear  image.  In
this case, flush it with a large quantity of water and wipe the cam-
era lens clean with a soft and wet cloth.

■ Differences between the screen and the actual road

The  distance  guide  lines  and  the  vehicle  width  extension  guide
lines may not actually be parallel with the dividing lines of the park-
ing space, even when they appear to be so. Be sure to check visu-
ally.
The distances between the vehicle width extension guide lines and
the  left  and  right  dividing  lines  of  the  parking  space  may  not  be
equal, even when they appear to be so. Be sure to check visually.
The  distance  guide  lines  give  a  distance  guide  for  flat  road  sur-
faces. In any of the following situations, there is a margin of error
between the fixation guide lines on the screen and the actual dis-
tance/course on the road.

● When the ground behind the vehicle slopes up sharply

The  distance  guide  lines will
appear  to  be  closer  to  the
vehicle  than  the  actual  dis-
tance.  Because  of 
this,
objects will appear to be far-
ther  away  than  they  actually

■ When approaching three-dimensional objects

The  distance  guide  lines  are  displayed  according  to  flat  surfaced
objects (such as the road). It is not possible to determine the posi-
tion of three-dimensional objects (such as vehicles) using the dis-
tance  guide  lines.  When  approaching  a  three-dimensional  object
that extends outward (such as the flatbed of a truck), be careful of
the following.
● Vehicle width extension guide lines

lines  and  the  vehicle  does
not look as if it hits the truck.
However,  the  rear  body  of

CAUTION

■When using the rear view monitor system 

The rear view monitor system is a supplemental device intended to assist
the driver  when  backing  up.  When backing  up,  be sure  to  check visually
behind and all around the vehicle before proceeding.
Observe the following precautions to avoid an accident that could result in
death or serious injuries.
●Never depend on the rear view monitor system entirely when backing up.
The image and the position of the guide lines displayed on the screen may
differ from the actual state.
Use caution, just as you would when backing up any vehicle.

●Be sure to back up slowly, depressing the brake pedal to control vehicle

speed.

●The instructions given are only guide lines.

When and how much to turn the steering wheel will vary according to traf-
fic conditions, road surface conditions, vehicle condition, etc. when park-
ing.  It  is  necessary  to  be  fully  aware  of  this  before  using  the  rear  view
monitor system. 

●When parking, be sure to check that the parking space will accommodate

your vehicle before maneuvering into it.

●Do not use the rear view monitor system in the following cases:

• On icy or slick road surfaces, or in snow
• When using tire chains
• When the back door is not closed completely
• On roads that are not flat or straight, such as curves or slopes.

●In low temperatures, the screen may darken or the image may become
faint.  The  image  could  distort  when  the  vehicle  is  moving,  or  you  may
become unable to see the image on the screen. Be sure to check direct
visually and with the mirrors all around the vehicle before proceeding.

●If the tire sizes are changed, the position of the fixed guide lines displayed

on the screen may change.

●The  camera  uses  a  special  lens.  The  distances  between  objects  and
pedestrians  that  appear  in the  image displayed on  the  screen  will  differ
from the actual distances. (→P. 337)

• As the camera has a water proof construction, do not detach, disassem-

ble or modify it. This may cause incorrect operation.

• When cleaning the camera lens, flush the camera with a large quantity
of water and wipe it with a soft and wet cloth. Strongly rubbing the cam-
era  lens  may  cause  the  camera  lens  to  be  scratched  and  unable  to
transmit a clear image.

• Do not allow organic solvent, car wax, window cleaner or glass coat to

adhere to the camera. If this happens, wipe it off as soon as possible.

• If the temperature changes rapidly, such as when hot water is poured

on the vehicle in cold weather, the system may not operate normally.

• When washing the vehicle, do not apply intensive bursts of water to the
camera or camera area. Doing so may result in the camera malfunc-
tioning.

• When the camera is used under fluorescent lights, sodium light or mer-
cury light etc., the lights and the illuminated areas may appear to flicker.
●Do not expose the camera to strong impact as this could cause a malfunc-
tion. If this happens, have the vehicle inspected by any authorized Toyota
retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer as soon as
possible.

Toyota parking assist monitor∗

The parking assist  monitor assists the driver by displaying  an
image of the view behind the vehicle while backing up, for exam-
ple while parking.

The  parking  assist  monitor  assists  with  the  following  2  backing-up
operations:
• Perpendicular parking (parking in a garage, etc.)
• Parallel parking (parking at the side of the road, etc.)

The screen illustrations used in this text are intended as examples, and
may differ from the image that is actually displayed on the screen.

Parking assist monitor will activate
when the shift lever is in R.

The parking assist monitor system
will  be  deactivated  when  the  shift
lever  is  in  any  position  other  than
R.
When  the  shift  lever  is  shifted  to
the  R  position  and any mode  but-
ton  (such  as  “MENU”)  is  pressed,
the  parking  assist  monitor  is  can-
celed,  and  the  screen  is  switched
to the mode of the button that was
pressed.

● Using the camera

If dirt or foreign matter (such as water droplets, snow, mud etc.)
is  adhering  to  the  camera,  it  cannot  transmit  a  clear  image.  In
this case, flush it with a large quantity of water and wipe the cam-
era lens clean with a soft and wet cloth.

■ Differences between the screen and the actual road

The  distance  guide  lines  and  the  vehicle  width  extension  guide
lines may not actually be parallel with the dividing lines of the park-
ing space, even when they appear to be so. Be sure to check visu-
ally.
The distances between the vehicle width extension guide lines and
the  left  and  right  dividing  lines  of  the  parking  space  may  not  be
equal, even when they appear to be so. Be sure to check visually.
The  distance  guide  lines  give  a  distance  guide  for  flat  road  sur-
faces. In any of the following situations, there is a margin of error
between  the  guide  lines  on  the  screen  and  the  actual  distance/
course on the road.

A margin of error

■ When approaching three-dimensional objects

The estimated course lines target a flat surfaced objects (such as
the  road).  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  position  of  three-
dimensional objects (such as vehicles) using the estimated course
lines and distance guide lines. When approaching a three-dimen-
sional object that extends outward (such as the flatbed of a truck),
be careful of the following.
● Estimated course lines

CAUTION

■When using the Toyota parking assist monitor system

The parking assist monitor is a supplemental device intended to assist the
driver when backing up. When backing up, be sure to check visually behind
and all around the vehicle before proceeding.
Observe the following precautions to avoid an accident that could result in
death or serious injuries.
●Never depend on the parking assist monitor entirely when backing up. The
image and the position of the guide lines displayed on the screen may dif-
fer from the actual state.
Use caution, just as you would when backing up any vehicle.

●Be sure to back up slowly, depressing the brake pedal to control vehicle

speed.

●If you seem likely to hit nearby vehicles, obstacles, people or mount the
shoulder,  depress  the  brake  pedal  to  stop  the  vehicle,  then  disable  the
assist system by select 

 on the screen to cancel the system.

●The instructions given are only guidelines.

When and how much to turn the steering wheel will vary according to traf-
fic conditions, road surface conditions, vehicle condition, etc. when park-
ing. It is necessary to be fully aware of this before using the parking assist
system.

CAUTION

●If the tire sizes are changed, the position of the guide lines displayed on

the screen may change.

●The  camera  uses  a  special  lens.  The  distances  between  objects  and
pedestrians  that  appear  in the  image displayed on  the  screen  will  differ
from the actual distances. (→P. 363)

■When using the perpendicular parking assist screen

Estimated course line display mode: If the steering wheel is straight and the
vehicle width extension guide lines and the estimated course lines are not in
alignment, have the vehicle inspected by any authorized Toyota retailer or
Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.
■When using the parallel parking assist screen

●Do not use the system if the display is incorrect due to an uneven (curvy/

hilly) road or a non-straight road.

●Make sure to operate the steering wheel only when the vehicle is stopped.
●Be sure to check that there are no obstacles inside the blue outline.

If there are any obstacles inside the blue outline, do not use the parallel
parking assist.

●When positioning the blue outline over the parking space, be sure to posi-
tion it so that the extended blue line may not cross the tire of the vehicle
parked in front of the empty space.

●If  the  extended  line  of  the  blue  outline
may  be  crossing  the  parked  vehicle,
your  vehicle  is  too  close.  Check  that
there is a gap of approximately 1 m (3
ft.) between your vehicle and the parked
vehicle.

PCS (Pre-Crash Safety system)∗

When the radar sensor detects possibility of a frontal collision,
the pre-crash safety system such as the brakes and seat belts
are  automatically  engaged  to  lessen  impact  as well  as  vehicle
damage.

◆ Pre-crash seat belts (front seat belts only)

If the pre-crash sensor detects that a collision is unavoidable, the
pre-crash safety system will retract the seat belt before the collision
occurs.
The same will happen if the driver makes an emergency braking or
loses control of the vehicle. (→P. 37)
However,  when  the  VSC  system  is  disabled,  the  system  will  not
operate in the event of skidding.

◆ Pre-crash brake assist

When  there  is  a  high  possibility  of  a  frontal  collision,  the  system
applies greater braking force in relation to how strongly the brake
pedal is depressed.

◆ Pre-crash braking (if equipped)

When  there  is  a  high  possibility  of  a  frontal  collision,  the  system
warns the driver using a warning light, warning display and buzzer.
If the system determines that a collision is unavoidable, the brakes
are automatically applied to reduce the collision speed. Pre-crash
braking can be disabled using the pre-crash braking off switch.

◆ AVS  (Adaptive  Variable  Suspension  System)  control  (if

equipped)
When  the  system  determines  that  there  is  a  high  possibility  of  a
frontal collision, the AVS optimizes the damping effect.

■Conditions that may trigger the system even if there is no possibility of a

collision
In any of the following situations where the frontal area of the radar sensor is
interrupted, the radar sensor may detect possibility of a frontal collision and
the system may be activated.
●When passing by an oncoming vehicle in a curve or a turn to the right or the

left

●When  rapidly  approaching  an  obstacle  ahead  (e.g.  preceding  vehicle,  toll

gate barrier, etc.)

●When  there  is  a  structural  object  (billboard,  low  ceiling,  fluorescent  light,

etc.) above the uphill road ahead

●When driving on a narrow road or through under a low overhead structure

(bridge, tunnel, fly-under, etc.)

●When driving on an uneven road surface
●When there is a metal object, bump, or protrusion on the road surface
●When vehicle’s front part is raised or lowered depending on loading condi-

tions

●When the direction of radar sensor is misaligned by strong impact applied

on an area around the radar sensor, etc.

●When there is an obstacle (guard rail, etc.) by the roadside at the entrance

to a curve

●When  the  front  of  your  vehicle  is  pointing  upwards  (caused  by  towing  a
trailer, during emergency towing or putting a heavy load in the luggage com-
partment etc.)

When the system is activated in the situations described above, there is also
a  possibility  that  the  seat  belts  will  retract  quickly  and  the  brakes  may  be
applied with a force greater than normal. When the seat belt is locked in the
restricted position, stop the vehicle in a safe place, release the seat belt and
refasten it.

4-5. Using the driving support systems

■Situations in which the pre-crash safety system does not function prop-

erly
The system may not function effectively in situations such as the following:
●On roads with sharp bends or uneven surfaces
●If a vehicle suddenly moves in front of your vehicle, such as at an intersec-

tion

●If a vehicle suddenly cuts in front of your vehicle, such as when overtaking
●In inclement weather such as heavy rain, fog, snow or sand storms
●When your vehicle is skidding with the VSC system off
●When an extreme change in vehicle height occurs
●When the axis of the radar is out of adjustment

■Automatic cancelation of pre-crash safety system

When a malfunction occurs due to sensor contaminations, etc. that results in
the sensors being unable to detect obstacles, the pre-crash safety system will
be automatically disabled. In this  case, the system will not activate even if
there is a collision possibility.

■Obstacles not detected

The sensor cannot detect plastic obstacles such as traffic cones. There may
also be occasions when the radar sensor cannot detect pedestrians, animals,
bicycles, motorcycles, trees, or snowdrifts.

■When there is a malfunction  in the system,  or if the system is tempo-

rarily unusable
Warning lights and/or warning messages will turn on or flash. (→P. 626, 639)

4-5. Using the driving support systems

CAUTION

■Limitations of the pre-crash safety system

The driver is solely responsible for safe driving. Always drive safely, taking
care to observe your surroundings.
Do not use the pre-crash safety system instead of normal braking opera-
tions  under  any  circumstances.  This  system  will  not  prevent  collisions  or
lessen damage or injuries in all cases. Do not overly rely on this system.
Failure to do so may cause an accident, resulting in death or serious injury.
This system has been designed to help avoid and reduce the impact of col-
lisions. However, the system operates differently depending on the situation
(→P.  392,  393).  As  a  result,  the  same  level  of  performance  may  not  be
expected in all cases. Also, the pre-crash safety brakes may not operate if
the driver is depressing the brake pedal or turning the steering wheel, as the
system will determine such conditions as collision avoidance operations.

■Cautions regarding the assist contents of the system

By  means  of  alarms  and  brake  control,  the  pre-crash  safety  system  is
intended  to assist  the  driver  in  avoiding collisions  through  the process  of
LOOK-JUDGE-ACT. There are limits to the degree of assistance the system
can provide, so please keep in mind the following important points.
●Assisting the driver in watching the road

The  pre-crash  safety  system  is  only  able  to  detect  obstacles  directly  in
front of the vehicle, and only within a limited range. It is not a mechanism
that allows careless or inattentive driving, and it is not a system that can
assist the driver in low-visibility conditions. It is still necessary for the driver
to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings.

●Assisting the driver in making correct judgment

When  attempting  to  estimate  the  possibility  of  a  collision,  the  only  data
available  to  the  pre-crash  safety  system  is  that  from  obstacles  it  has
detected directly in front of the vehicle. Therefore, it is absolutely neces-
sary for the driver to remain vigilant and to determine whether or not there
is a possibility of collision in any given situation.

●Assisting the driver in taking action

The pre-crash safety system’s braking assist feature is designed to help
reduce the severity of a collision, and so only acts when the system has
judged that a collision is unavoidable. This system is not capable of auto-
matically avoiding a collision or bringing the vehicle to a stop safely with-
out appropriate operations performed by the driver. For this reason, when
encountering a dangerous situation the driver must take direct and imme-
diate action in order to ensure the safety of all involved.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

4-5. Using the driving support systems

CAUTION

■When the sensor may not be correctly detecting the vehicle ahead

Apply the brakes as necessary in any of the following situations.
●When water or snow thrown up by the surrounding vehicles hinders the

functioning of the sensor

●When your vehicle is pointing upwards (caused by a heavy load in the lug-

gage compartment etc.)

●Vehicles that cut in suddenly
●Vehicles with small rear ends (trailers with no load on board etc.)
●Motorcycles traveling in the same lane

■Handling the radar sensor

Observe the following to ensure the pre-crash safety system can function
effectively:
●Keep the sensor and front grille clean at all times.

Clean the sensor and front grille with a soft cloth so you do not mark or
damage them.

●Do not subject the sensor or surrounding area to a strong impact.

If  the  sensor  moves  even  slightly  off  position,  the  system  may  become
inaccurate or malfunction. If the sensor or surrounding area is subject to a
strong impact, always have the area inspected and adjusted by any autho-
rized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

●Do not disassemble the sensor.
●Do not attach accessories or stickers to the sensor, grille or surrounding

area.

●Do not modify or paint the sensor and grille cover.
●If the sensor needs to be replaced, contact any authorized Toyota retailer

or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

Winter driving tips

Carry  out  the  necessary  preparations  and  inspections  before
driving the vehicle in winter. Always drive the vehicle in a man-
ner appropriate to the prevailing weather conditions.

Pre-winter preparations
● Use  fluids  that  are  appropriate  to  the  prevailing  outside  tempera-

tures.
• Engine oil
• Engine coolant
• Washer fluid

● Have a service technician inspect the condition of the battery.
● Have the vehicle fitted with four snow tires or purchase a set of tire

chains for the rear tires.
Ensure that all tires are the same size and brand, and that chains match
the size of the tires.

Before driving the vehicle
Perform the following according to the driving conditions:
● Do not try to forcibly open a window or move a wiper that is frozen.
Pour warm water over the frozen area to melt the ice. Wipe away
the water immediately to prevent it from freezing.

● To  ensure  proper  operation  of  the  climate  control  system  fan,
remove  any  snow  that  has  accumulated  on  the  air  inlet  vents  in
front of the windshield.

● Check for and remove any excess ice or snow that may have accu-
mulated  on  the  exterior  lights,  vehicle’s  roof,  chassis,  around  the
tires or on the brakes.

● Remove  any snow  or mud from  the  bottom  of your  shoes  before

getting in the vehicle.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

4-6. Driving tips

401

When driving the vehicle
Accelerate the vehicle slowly, keep a safe distance between you and
the vehicle ahead, and drive at a reduced speed suitable to road con-
ditions.

When parking the vehicle (in the winter time or in the cold lati-
tudes)
● Park the vehicle and move the shift lever to P (automatic transmis-
sion)  or  1  or  R  (manual  transmission)  without  setting  the  parking
brake. The parking brake may freeze up, preventing it from being
released. If the vehicle is parked without setting the parking brake,
make sure to block the wheels.
Failure to do so may be dangerous because it may cause the vehi-
cle to move unexpectedly, possibly leading to an accident.

● For vehicles with an automatic transmission: If the vehicle is parked
without setting the parking brake, confirm that the shift lever cannot
be moved out of P*.

*: The shift lever will be locked if it is attempted to be shifted from P to any
other position without depressing the brake pedal. If the shift lever can be
shifted from P, there may be a problem with the shift lock system. Have the
vehicle inspected by any authorized Toyota retailer or  Toyota authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer immediately.

Selecting tire chains
Use the correct tire chain size when mounting the snow chains. 
Chain size is regulated for each tire size.

tion and type of road. Always check local regulations before installing
chains.

■Tire chain installation

Observe the following precautions when installing and removing chains:
●Install and remove tire chains in a safe location.
●Install tire chains on the rear tires. Do not install tire chains on the front tires.
●Install tire chains on rear tires as tightly as possible. Retighten chains after

driving 0.5 - 1.0 km (1/4 - 1/2 mile).

●Install tire chains following the instructions provided with the tire chains.

CAUTION

■Driving with snow tires

Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents.
Failure to do so may result in a loss of vehicle control and cause death or
serious injury.
●Use tires of the specified size.
●Maintain the recommended level of air pressure.
●Do not drive at speeds in excess of the speed limit or the speed limit spec-

ified for the snow tires being used.

●Use snow tires on all, not just some wheels.

■Driving with tire chains

Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents.
Failing to do so may result in the vehicle being unable to be driven safely,
and may cause death or serious injury.
●Do not drive in excess of the speed limit specified for the tire chains being

used, or 50 km/h (30 mph), whichever is lower.

●Avoid driving on bumpy road surfaces or over potholes.
●Avoid sudden acceleration, abrupt steering, sudden braking and shifting

operations that cause sudden engine braking.

●Slow down sufficiently before entering a curve to ensure that vehicle con-

trol is maintained.

■MP3 and WMA files

MP3 (MPEG Audio LAYER3) is a standard audio compression format.
Files can be compressed to approximately 1/10 of their original size by using
MP3 compression.
WMA (Windows Media Audio) is a Microsoft audio compression format.
This format compresses audio data to a size smaller than that of the MP3 for-
mat.
There is a limit to the MP3 and WMA file standards and to the media/formats
recorded by them that can be used.

●Compatible media

Media that can be used for MP3 and WMA playback are CD-Rs and CD-
RWs.
Playback in some instances may not be possible, depending on the status
of the CD-R or CD-RW. Playback may not be possible or the audio may
jump if the disc is scratched or marked with fingerprints.

●Compatible disc formats

The following disc formats can be used.
• Disc formats: CD-ROM Mode 1 and Mode 2

• File formats:ISO9660 Level 1, Level 2, (Romeo, Joliet)

CD-ROM XA Mode 2, Form 1 and Form 2

MP3 and WMA files written in any format other than those listed above
may not play correctly, and their file names and folder names may not be
displayed correctly.

Items related to standards and limitations are as follows.
• Maximum directory hierarchy: 8 levels
• Maximum length of folder names/file names: 32 characters
• Maximum number of folders: 192 (including the root)
• Maximum number of files per disc: 255

●File names

The only files that can be recognized as MP3/WMA and played are those
with the extension .mp3 or .wma.

●Multi-sessions

As the audio system is compatible with multi-sessions, it is possible to play
discs that contain MP3 and WMA files. However, only the first session can
be played.

●ID3 and WMA tags

ID3 tags can be added to MP3 files, making it possible to record the track
title and artist name, etc.
The system is compatible with ID3 Ver. 1.0, 1.1, and Ver. 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 ID3
tags. (The number of characters is based on ID3 Ver. 1.0 and 1.1.) 
WMA  tags  can  be  added  to  WMA  files,  making  it  possible  to  record  the
track title and artist name in the same way as with ID3 tags.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

5-4. Playing an audio CD and MP3/WMA discs

421

●MP3 and WMA playback

When a disc containing MP3 or WMA files is inserted, all files on the disc
are first checked. Once the file check is finished, the first MP3 or WMA file
is played. To make the file check finish more quickly, we recommend you do
not write in any files other than MP3 or WMA files or create any unneces-
sary folders.
If the discs contain a mixture of music data and MP3 or WMA format data,
only music data can be played.

●Extensions

If the file extensions .mp3 and .wma are used for files other than MP3 and
WMA  files,  they  will  be  mistakenly  recognized  and  played  as  MP3  and
WMA files. This may result in large amounts of interference and damage to
the speakers.

●Playback

• To play MP3 file with steady sound quality, we recommend a fixed bit rate

of 128 kbps and a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.

• CD-R  or  CD-RW  playback  may  not  be  possible  in  some  instances,

depending on the characteristics of the disc.

• There is a wide variety of freeware and other encoding software for MP3
and WMA files on the market, and depending on the status of the encod-
ing and the file format, poor sound quality or noise at the start of playback
may result. In some cases, playback may not be possible at all.

• When files other than MP3 or WMA files are recorded on a disc, it may
take more time to recognize the disc and in some cases, playback may
not be possible at all.

• Microsoft, Windows, and Windows Media are the registered trademarks

of Microsoft Corporation in the U.S. and other countries.

●MP3 and WMA playback

• When a device containing MP3 or WMA files is connected, all files in the
USB memory device are checked. Once the file check is finished, the first
MP3 or WMA file is played. To make the file check finish more quickly, we
recommend  that  you  do  not  include  any  files  other  than  MP3  or  WMA
files or create any unnecessary folders.

• When the USB device is connected and the audio source is changed to
USB memory mode, the USB device will start playing the first file in the
first folder. If the same device is removed and reinserted (and the con-
tents have not been changed), the USB memory will resume play from
the same point in which it was last used.

●Extensions

If the file extensions .mp3 and .wma are used for files other than MP3 and
WMA files, they will be skipped (not played).

■Fogging up of the windows

●Vehicles  with  the  “A/C”  button:  The  windows  will  easily  fog  up  when  the
humidity in the vehicle is high. Turning the “A/C” button on will dehumidify
the air from the outlets and defog the windshield effectively.

●Vehicles with the “A/C” button: If you turn the “A/C” button off, the windows

may fog up more easily.

●The windows may fog up if the recirculated air mode is used.

■Outside/recirculated air mode

When driving on dusty roads such as tunnels or in heavy traffic, set the out-
side/recirculated air mode button to the recirculated air mode. This is effective
in  preventing  outside  air  from  entering  the  vehicle  interior.  During  cooling
operation, setting the recirculated air mode will also cool the vehicle interior
effectively.

■When outside air temperature is low (vehicles with the “A/C” button)

The cooling and dehumidification function may not operate even when the “A/C”
button is pressed.

■Ventilation and air conditioning odors

●To let fresh air in, set the air conditioning system to the outside air mode.
●During use, various odors from inside and outside the vehicle may enter into
and accumulate in the air conditioning system. This may then cause odor to
be emitted from the vents.

●To reduce potential odors from occurring:

It  is  recommended  that  the  air  conditioning  system  be  set  to  outside  air
mode prior to turning the vehicle off.

CAUTION

■To prevent the windshield from fogging up

●Do not use 

 during cool air operation in extremely humid weather. The
difference between the temperature of the outside air and that of the wind-
shield can cause the outer surface of the windshield to fog up, blocking
your vision.

●Do not place anything on the instrument
panel  which  may  cover  the  air  outlets.
Otherwise, air flow may be obstructed,
preventing  the  windshield  defoggers
from defogging.

■To prevent burns

●Do not touch the rear view mirror surfaces when the outside rear view mir-

ror defoggers are on. (vehicles with outside rear view mirror defoggers)

●Do not touch the glass at lower part of the windshield or to the side of the
front pillars when the windshield wiper de-icer is on. (vehicles with wind-
shield wiper de-icer)

Power heater∗

This feature is used to keep the cab warm in cold conditions.

On/off

The  power  heater  turns  on  about
30  seconds  after  you  press  the
switch  and  it  takes  about  another
55 seconds to warm up.

■Power heater can be operated when

●The engine is running.
●The outside temperature is low.
●The engine coolant temperature is low.

■Normal characteristics of power heater operation

The following cases do not indicate a malfunction.
●When the power heater is turned on or off, some white smoke and a slight
odor may be emitted from the power heater exhaust that is located under
the floor.

●When  the  power  heater  is  being  used  under  extremely  cold  conditions,

vapor may be visible from its exhaust.

●When the power heater is turned off, you may hear a sound in the engine
compartment for about 2 minutes until the power heater turns off completely.

■After the heater is off

We recommend not restarting the heater for 10 minutes after you turn it off.
Otherwise, a noise may be heard as the heater ignites.

■When refueling your vehicle

The engine must be turned off. Turning the engine off turns the power heater
off.

CAUTION

■To prevent burns or damage on your vehicle

●Do not  touch the  heater  or its  exhaust

pipe as they are hot.

●Keep  flammable  items  such  as  fuel
away  from  the  heater  and  its  exhaust
pipe. This may cause a fire.

NOTICE

■To prevent damage to your vehicle

●Do not turn the heater on and off repeatedly in 5 minute intervals as this
can shorten the life of the heater components. If the engine must be turned
on and off repeatedly within short intervals (such as when the vehicle is
being used for delivery purposes), turn the heater off.

●Do not modify or open the heater without consulting any authorized Toyota
retailer  or  Toyota  authorized  repairer,  or  any  reliable  repairer.  This  may
cause a heater malfunction or a fire.

●Be careful not to splash water or spill liquid directly on the heater or on the

heater fuel pump. This may cause the heater to malfunction.

●Keep the intake and exhaust pipes of the heater free from water, snow,
ice, mud, etc. If the pipes become clogged, this can cause the heater to
malfunction.

●If you notice anything unusual, such as a fluid leak, smoke or poor opera-
tion, turn off the heater and have your vehicle checked by any authorized
Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

ERA-GLONASS∗

ERA-GLONASS is a telematics service that uses Global Naviga-
tion  Satellite  System  (GLONASS)  data  and  embedded  cellular
technology to enable the following emergency calls to be made:
Automatic  emergency  calls  (Automatic  Collision  Notification)
and  manual  emergency  calls  (by  pressing  the  “SOS”  button).
This  service  is  required  by  Eurasian  Customs  Union  Regula-
tions.

Emergency Notification Services
■ Automatic Collision Notification

If any airbag deploys, the system is designed to automatically call
the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)*. The responding agent
receives the vehicle’s location and attempts to speak with the vehi-
cle  occupants to  assess the level of  emergency.  If  the  occupants
are unable to communicate, the agent automatically treats the call
as  an  emergency,  contacts  the  nearest  emergency  services  pro-
vider to describe the situation, and requests that assistance be sent
to the location.
*: In some cases, the call cannot be made. (→P. 522)

■ Emergency Assistance Button (“SOS”)

In the event of an emergency, push the “SOS” button to reach the
Public  Safety  Answering  Point  (PSAP).  The  answering  agent  will
determine your vehicle’s location, assess the emergency, and dis-
patch the necessary assistance required.

If you accidentally press the “SOS” button, tell the agent that you are not
experiencing an emergency.

Indicator lights
When the engine switch is turned to the “ON” position (vehicles with-
out  a  smart  entry  &  start  system)  or  IGNITION  ON  mode  (vehicles
with a smart entry & start system), the red indicator light will illuminate
for 10 seconds and then the green indicator light will illuminate for 2
seconds,  indicating  that  the  system  is  enabled.  The  indicator  lights
indicate the following:
● If the green indicator light illuminates and stays on, the system is

enabled.

● If the green indicator light flashes, an emergency call is being made

(either automatically or manually).

● If no indicator lights illuminate, the system is not enabled.
● If the red indicator light illuminates any time other than immediately
after the engine switch is turned to the “ON” position (vehicles with-
out a smart entry & start system) or IGNITION ON mode (vehicles
with a smart entry & start system), the system may be malfunction-
ing or the backup battery may be depleted. Contact any authorized
Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized  repairer,  or  any  reliable
repairer.
The service life of the backup battery is 3 years or more.

CAUTION

■When the Emergency Call may not be made

●Any of the followings may occur. In such cases, report to the Public Safety

Answering Point (PSAP) by other means such as nearby public phones.
• It may sometimes be difficult to connect to the Public Safety Answering
Point (PSAP) even in the reception area of the cellular phone due to the
reception level, or if the line is busy. In such cases, you may not be able
to connect to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and thus will
not  be  able  to  make  emergency  calls  and  report  to  the  emergency
departments  even  though  the  system  tries  to  connect  to  the  Public
Safety Answering Point (PSAP).

• When the vehicle is out of the cellular phone service area, the Emer-

gency Call cannot be made.

• When any related equipment (such as the “SOS” button panel, indicator
lights,  microphone,  speaker,  DCM,  antenna,  or  any  wires  connecting
the equipment.) has an abnormality, is damaged or broken, the Emer-
gency Call cannot be made.

• During  the  Emergency  Call,  the  system  makes  repeated  attempts  to
connect  to  the  Public  Safety  Answering  Point  (PSAP).  However,  if  it
cannot  connect  to  the  Public  Safety  Answering  Point  (PSAP)  due  to
poor radio wave reception, the system may not be able to connect to
the cellular network and the call may finish without connecting. The red
indicator light will blink for approximately 30 seconds to indicate this dis-
connection.

• This device may not function if a shock is applied to it.

●If the battery’s voltage decreases or there is a disconnection, the system

may not be able to access the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).

■For your safety

●Please drive safely.

The function of this system is to assist you in making the Emergency Call
in case of accidents as traffic accidents or sudden medical emergencies,
and it does not protect the driver or the passengers in any way. Please
drive safely and fasten your seatbelts at all times for your safety.

●In case of an emergency, make lives the top priority.
●If you smell anything burning or another unusual smell, do not stay inside

the vehicle and evacuate to a safe area immediately.

●Since the system detects shocks, the automatic reporting may not always
occur synchronized with the operation of the airbag system. (If the vehicle
is bumped from behind, etc.)

●The  airbag  may  not  inflate  even  in  case  of  an  accident,  if  it  does  not

involve high impact.
In such cases, the system may not make emergency calls automatically.
The system may also not make automatic emergency calls even if the air-
bag has been inflated. If any of these should occur, please report to the
Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) by operating the “SOS” button.

●For safety, do not make the Emergency Call while driving.

Making calls during driving may cause mishandling of the steering wheel,
which may lead to unexpected accidents. Stop the vehicle and confirm the
safety of the area before making the Emergency Call.

●When changing fuses, please use fuses that correspond to the described

standard.
If  you  use  fuses  other  than  those  described,  it  may  cause  ignition  or
smoke in the circuit and may lead to a fire.

●Using the system while there is smoke or an unusual smell may cause a
fire. Stop using the system immediately and consult any authorized Toyota
retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

7-1. Maintenance and care

Cleaning and protecting the vehicle interior

The following procedures will help protect your vehicle’s interior
and keep it in top condition:

Protecting the vehicle interior
● Remove dirt and dust using a vacuum cleaner. Wipe dirty surfaces

with a cloth dampened with lukewarm water.

● If dirt cannot be removed, wipe it off with a soft cloth dampened with

neutral detergent diluted to approximately 1%.

● Wring out any excess water from the cloth and thoroughly wipe off

remaining traces of detergent and water.

Cleaning the leather areas
● Remove dirt and dust using a vacuum cleaner.
● Wipe  any  excess  dirt  and  dust  with  a  soft  cloth  dampened  with

diluted detergent.
Use a diluted water solution of approximately 5 % neutral wool detergent.
● Wring out any excess water from the cloth and thoroughly wipe off

all remaining traces of detergent.

● Wipe  the  surface  with  a  dry,  soft  cloth  to  remove  any  remaining

moisture. Allow the leather to dry in a shaded ventilated area.

Cleaning the synthetic leather areas
● Remove dirt and dust using a vacuum cleaner.
● Wipe it off with a soft cloth dampened with neutral detergent diluted

to approximately 1%.

● Wring out any excess water from the cloth and thoroughly wipe off

remaining traces of detergent and water.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

7-1. Maintenance and care

531

■Caring for leather areas

Toyota recommends cleaning the interior of the vehicle at least twice a year to
maintain the quality of the vehicle’s interior.

■Shampooing the carpets

There are several commercial foaming-type cleaners available. Use a sponge
or brush to apply the foam. Rub in overlapping circles. Do not use water. The
excellent results are obtained when keeping the carpet as dry as possible.

■Seat belts

Clean  with  mild  soap  and  lukewarm  water  using  a  cloth  or  sponge.  Also
check the belts periodically for excessive wear, fraying or cuts.

CAUTION

■Water in the vehicle

●Do not splash or spill liquid in the vehicle.

Doing  so  may  cause  electrical  components  etc.  to  malfunction  or  catch
fire.

●Do not get any of the SRS components or wiring in the vehicle interior wet. 

(→P. 43)
An electrical malfunction may cause the airbags to deploy or not function
properly, resulting in death or serious injury.

■Cleaning the interior (especially instrument panel)

Do not use polish wax or polish cleaner. The instrument panel may reflect
off the windshield, obstructing the driver’s view and leading to an accident,
resulting in death or serious injury.

Maintenance requirements

To ensure safe and economical driving, day-to-day care and reg-
ular maintenance are essential. Toyota recommends the follow-
ing maintenance:

Scheduled maintenance
Scheduled  maintenance  should  be  performed  at  specified  intervals
according to the maintenance schedule.

For full details of your maintenance schedule, refer to the “Toyota Service
Booklet” or “Toyota Warranty Booklet”.

Do-it-yourself maintenance
What about do-it-yourself maintenance?

Many  maintenance  items  are  easy  to  do  yourself  if  you  have  a  little
mechanical ability and a few basic automotive tools.
Note,  however,  that  some  maintenance  tasks  require  special  tools  and
skills. These are best performed by qualified technicians. Even if you’re an
experienced  do-it-yourself  mechanic,  we  recommend  that  repairs  and
maintenance  be  conducted  by  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota
authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer. Any authorized Toyota retailer
or repairer will keep a record of maintenance, which could be useful should
you ever require Warranty Service. Should you choose to select a qualified
and equipped professional other than an authorized Toyota repairer to ser-
vice  or  maintain  your  vehicle,  we  recommend  that  you  request  that  a
record of maintenance be kept.

7-2. Maintenance

■Where to go for maintenance service?

In order to maintain your vehicle in the best possible condition, Toyota recom-
mends that maintenance service operations as well as other inspections and
repairs  be  carried  out  by  authorized  Toyota  retailers  or  Toyota  authorized
repairers, or any reliable repairers. For repairs and services covered by your
warranty, please visit an authorized Toyota retailer or repairer, who will use
genuine Toyota parts in repairing any difficulties you may encounter. There
can also be advantages in utilizing authorized Toyota retailers or repairers for
non-warranty repairs and services, as members of the Toyota network will be
able to expertly assist you with any difficulties you may encounter.
Your Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer will
perform all of the scheduled maintenance on your vehicle reliably and eco-
nomically due to their experience with Toyota vehicles.

■Does your vehicle need repairs?

Be on the alert for changes in performance and sounds, and visual tip-offs
that indicate service is needed. Some important clues are:
●Engine missing, stumbling or pinging
●Appreciable loss of power
●Strange engine noises
●A fluid leak under the vehicle (However, water dripping from the air condi-

tioning system after use is normal.)

●Change in exhaust sound (This may indicate a dangerous carbon monoxide
leak. Drive with the windows open and have the exhaust system checked
immediately.)

●Flat-looking tires, excessive tire squeal when cornering, uneven tire wear
●Vehicle pulls to one side when driven straight on a level road
●Strange noises related to suspension movement
●Loss  of  brake  effectiveness,  spongy  feeling  brake  pedal  or  clutch  pedal,

pedal almost touches the floor, vehicle pulls to one side when braking
●Engine coolant temperature continually higher than normal (→P. 107)
If you notice any of these clues, take your vehicle to any authorized Toyota
retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer as soon as pos-
sible. Your vehicle may need adjustment or repair.

CAUTION

The  engine  compartment  contains  many  mechanisms  and  fluids  that  may
move suddenly, become hot, or become electrically energized. To avoid death
or serious injury, observe the following precautions:
■When working on the engine compartment

●Keep  hands,  clothing  and  tools  away  from  the  moving  fan  and  engine

drive belt.

●Be careful not to touch the engine, radiator, exhaust manifold, etc. right

after driving as they may be hot. Oil and other fluids may also be hot.

●Do not leave anything that may burn easily, such as paper or rags, in the

engine compartment.

●Do not smoke, cause sparks or expose an open flame to fuel or the bat-

tery. Fuel and battery fumes are flammable.

●Be extremely cautious when working on the battery. It contains poisonous

and corrosive sulfuric acid.

●Take care because brake fluid can harm your hands or eyes and damage
painted  surfaces.  If  fluid  gets  on  your  hands  or  in  your  eyes,  flush  the
affected area with clean water immediately. If you still experience discom-
fort, consult a doctor.

■When working near the electric cooling fans or radiator grille

Vehicles without a smart entry & start system: Be sure the engine switch is
off.  With  the  engine  switch  in  the  “ON”  position,  the  electric  cooling  fans
may automatically start to run if the air conditioning is on and/or the coolant
temperature is high. (→P. 551)
Vehicles with a smart entry & start system: Be sure the engine switch is off.
With the engine switch in IGNITION ON mode, the electric cooling fans may
automatically start to run if the air conditioning is on and/or the coolant tem-
perature is high. (→P. 551) 

■When working on or under the vehicle

Do not get under the vehicle with just the jack supporting it.
Always use automotive jack stands or other solid supports.

Tire pressure warning system (if equipped)
Your vehicle is equipped with a tire pressure warning system that uses
tire pressure warning valves and transmitters to detect low tire infla-
tion pressure before serious problems arise. 
If the  tire  pressure drops  below  a  predetermined  level,  the  driver  is
warned by a warning light. (→P. 629)
◆ Installing tire pressure warning valves and transmitters

When replacing tires or wheels, tire pressure warning valves and
transmitters must also be installed.
When  new  tire  pressure  warning  valves  and  transmitters  are
installed,  new  ID  codes  must  be  registered  in  the  tire  pressure
warning  computer  and  the  tire  pressure  warning  system  must  be
initialized.  Have  tire  pressure  warning  valve  and  transmitter  ID
codes registered by any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota autho-
rized repairer, or any reliable repairer. (→P. 569)
◆ Initializing the tire pressure warning system
■ The tire pressure warning system must be initialized in the fol-

lowing circumstances:
● When changing the tire size.
● When the tire inflation pressure is changed such as when chang-

ing traveling speed.

When the tire pressure warning system is initialized, the current tire
inflation pressure is set as the benchmark pressure.

◆ Registering ID codes

The tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is equipped with a
unique ID code. When replacing a tire pressure warning valve and
transmitter, it is necessary to register the ID code. Have the ID code
registered  by  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer.

■When to replace your vehicle’s tires

Tires should be replaced if:
●The treadwear indicators are showing on a tire.
●You have tire damage such as cuts, splits, cracks deep enough to expose

the fabric, and bulges indicating internal damage

●A tire goes flat repeatedly or cannot be properly repaired due to the size or

location of a cut or other damage

If  you  are  not  sure,  consult  with  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota
authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

■Replacing tires and wheels (vehicles with the tire pressure warning sys-

tem)
If the ID code of the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is not regis-
tered, the tire pressure warning system will not work properly. After driving for
about 10 minutes, the tire pressure warning light blinks for 1 minute and stays
on to indicate a system malfunction.

■Tire life

Any tire over 6 years old must be checked by a qualified technician even if it
has seldom or never been used or damage is not obvious.

■Routine  tire  inflation  pressure  checks  (vehicles  with  the  tire  pressure

warning system)
The tire pressure warning system does not replace routine tire inflation pres-
sure checks. Make sure to check tire inflation pressure as part of your routine
of daily vehicle checks.

■If the tread on snow tires wears down below 4 mm (0.16 in.)

The effectiveness of the tires as snow tires is lost.

■Situations in which the tire pressure warning system may not operate

properly (if equipped)
●In the following cases, the tire pressure warning system may not operate

properly.
• If non-genuine Toyota wheels are used. 
• A tire has been replaced with a tire that is not an OE (Original Equipment)

tire.

• A tire has been replaced with a tire that is not of the specified size.
• Tire chains etc. are equipped.
• An auxiliary-supported run-flat tire is equipped.
• If a window tint that affects the radio wave signals is installed.
• If  there  is  a  lot  of  snow  or  ice  on  the  vehicle,  particularly  around  the

wheels or wheel housings.

• If the tire inflation pressure is extremely higher than the specified level.
• If the spare tire is in a location subject to poor radio wave signal recep-
tion.*
• If a large metallic object which can interfere with signal reception is put
near the spare tire.*
• If tires not equipped with the tire pressure warning valves and transmit-
ters are used.

• If the ID code on the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters is not

registered in the tire pressure warning computer.
*: Vehicles with the spare tire only

●Performance may be affected in the following situations.

• Near a TV tower, electric power plant, gas station, radio station, large dis-
play, airport or other facility that generates strong radio waves or electri-
cal noise

• When carrying a portable radio, cellular phone, cordless phone or other

wireless communication device

●When the vehicle is parked, the time taken for the warning to start or go off

could be extended.

●When  tire  inflation  pressure  declines  rapidly  for  example  when  a  tire  has

burst, the warning may not function.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance

571

■The initialization operation (vehicles with the tire pressure warning sys-

tem)
●Make sure to carry out initialization after adjusting the tire inflation pressure.
Also,  make  sure  the  tires  are  cold  before  carrying  out  initialization  or  tire
inflation pressure adjustment.

●If  you  have  accidentally  turned  the  engine  switch  to  the  “LOCK”  position
(vehicles without a smart entry & start system) or off (vehicles with a smart
entry  &  start  system)  during  initialization,  it  is  not  necessary  to  press  the
reset switch again as initialization will restart automatically when the engine
switch has been turned to the “ON” position (vehicles without a smart entry
& start system) or IGNITION ON mode (vehicles with a smart entry & start
system) for the next time.

●If you accidentally press the reset switch when initialization is not necessary,
adjust  the  tire  inflation  pressure  to  the  specified  level  when  the  tires  are
cold, and conduct initialization again.

■Warning performance of the tire pressure warning system (if equipped)
The warning of the tire pressure warning system will change in accordance
with the conditions under which it was initialized. For this reason, the system
may give a warning even if the tire pressure does not reach a low enough
level, or if the pressure is higher than the pressure that was adjusted to when
the system was initialized.

■When  initialization  of  the  tire  pressure  warning  system  has  failed  (if

equipped)
Initialization  can  be  completed  in  a  few  minutes.  However,  in  the  following
cases, the settings have not been recorded and the system will not operate
properly.  If  repeated  attempts  to  record  tire  inflation  pressure  settings  are
unsuccessful, have the vehicle inspected by any authorized Toyota retailer or
Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.
●When  operating  the  tire  pressure  warning  reset  switch,  the  tire  pressure

warning light does not blink 3 times.

●After  driving  for  a  certain  period  of  time  since  the  initialization  has  been

completed, the warning light comes on after blinking for 1 minute.

CAUTION

■When inspecting or replacing tires

Observe the following precautions to prevent accidents.
Failure to do so may cause damage to parts of the drive train as well as
dangerous handling characteristics, which may lead to an accident resulting
in death or serious injury.
●Do not mix tires of different makes, models or tread patterns.

Also, do not mix tires of remarkably different treadwear.

●Do not use tire sizes other than those recommended by Toyota.
●Do  not  mix  differently  constructed  tires  (radial,  bias-belted  or  bias-ply

tires).

●Do not mix summer, all season and snow tires.
●Do not use tires that have been used on another vehicle.

Do not use tires if you do not know how they were used previously. 
■When initializing the tire pressure warning system (if equipped)

Do not operate the tire pressure warning reset switch without first adjusting
the tire inflation pressure to the specified level. Otherwise, the tire pressure
warning light may not come on even if the tire inflation pressure is low, or it
may come on when the tire inflation pressure is actually normal.

7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance

NOTICE

■Repairing  or  replacing  tires,  wheels,  tire  pressure  warning  valves,
transmitters and tire valve caps (vehicles with the tire pressure warn-
ing system)
●When  removing  or  fitting  the  wheels,  tires  or  the  tire  pressure  warning
valves and transmitters, contact any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota
authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer as the tire pressure warning
valves and transmitters may be damaged if not handled correctly.

●Make  sure  to  install  the  tire  valve  caps.  If  the  tire  valve  caps  are  not
installed, water could enter the tire pressure warning valves and the tire
pressure warning valves could be bound.

●When replacing tire valve caps, do not use tire valve caps other than those

specified. The cap may become stuck.

■To avoid damage to the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters

(vehicles with the tire pressure warning system)
When a tire is repaired with liquid sealants, the tire pressure warning valve
and transmitter may not operate properly. If a liquid sealant is used, contact
any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable
repairer or other qualified service shop as soon as possible. After use of liq-
uid sealant, make sure to replace the tire pressure warning valve and trans-
mitter when repairing or replacing the tire. (→P. 567)

■Driving on rough roads

Take particular care when driving on roads with loose surfaces or potholes.
These conditions may cause losses in tire inflation pressure, reducing the
cushioning ability of the tires. In addition, driving on rough roads may cause
damage to the tires themselves, as well as the vehicle’s wheels and body.

■If tire inflation pressure of each tire becomes low while driving
Do not continue driving, or your tires and/or wheels may be ruined.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance

Tire inflation pressure

Make  sure  to  maintain  the  proper  tire  inflation  pressure.  Tire
inflation pressure should be checked at least once per month.
However,  Toyota  recommends  that  tire  inflation  pressure  be
checked once every two weeks. (→P. 735)

■Effects of incorrect tire inflation pressure

Driving with incorrect tire inflation pressure may result in the following:
●Reduced fuel economy
●Reduced driving comfort and poor handling
●Reduced tire life due to wear
●Reduced safety
●Damage to the drive train
If  a  tire  needs  frequent  refilling,  have  it  checked  by  any  authorized  Toyota
retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

■Instructions for checking tire inflation pressure

When checking tire inflation pressure, observe the following:
●Check only when the tires are cold.

If your vehicle has been parked for at least 3 hours and has not been driven
for more than 1.5 km or 1 mile, you will get an accurate cold tire inflation
pressure reading.

●Always use a tire pressure gauge.

It is difficult to judge if a tire is properly inflated based only on its appear-
ance.

●It is normal for the tire inflation pressure to be higher after driving as heat is

generated in the tire. Do not reduce tire inflation pressure after driving.

●Passengers and luggage weight should be placed so that the vehicle is bal-

anced.

CAUTION

■Proper inflation is critical to save tire performance

Keep your tires properly inflated.
If  the  tires  are  not  properly  inflated,  the  following  conditions  may  occur
which could lead to an accident resulting in death or serious injury:
●Excessive wear
●Uneven wear
●Poor handling
●Possibility of blowouts resulting from overheated tires
●Air leaking from between tire and wheel
●Wheel deformation and/or tire damage
●Greater  possibility  of  tire  damage  while  driving  (due  to  road  hazards,

expansion joints, sharp edges in the road, etc.)

NOTICE

■When inspecting and adjusting tire inflation pressure

Be sure to put the tire valve caps back on.
If a valve cap is not installed, dirt or moisture may get into the valve and
cause an air leak, resulting in decreased tire inflation pressure.

Wheels

If  a  wheel  is  bent,  cracked  or  heavily  corroded,  it  should  be
replaced.
Otherwise, the tire may separate from the wheel or cause loss of
handling control.

Wheel selection
When replacing wheels, care should be taken to ensure that they are
equivalent to those removed in load capacity, diameter, rim width, and
inset*.
Replacement wheels are available at any authorized Toyota retailer or
Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.
Toyota does not recommend using the following:
*: Conventionally referred to as “offset”.
● Wheels of different sizes or types
● Used wheels
● Bent wheels that have been straightened

Aluminum wheel precautions (if equipped)
● Use  only  Toyota  wheel  nuts  and  wrenches designed  for use  with

your aluminum wheels.

● When  rotating,  repairing  or  changing  your  tires,  check  that  the

wheel nuts are still tight after driving 1600 km (1000 miles).

● Be  careful  not  to  damage  the  aluminum  wheels  when  using  tire

chains.

● When  balancing  your  wheels,  use  only  Toyota  genuine  balance
weights  or  the  equivalent.  If  clip-on  balance  weights  are  being
used, use a plastic or rubber hammer to install the weight.

7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance

■When replacing wheels (vehicles with the tire pressure warning system)
The  wheels  of  your  Toyota  are  equipped  with  tire  pressure  warning  valves
and  transmitters  that  allow  the  tire  pressure  warning  system  to  provide
advance warning in the event of a loss in tire inflation pressure. Whenever
wheels are replaced, tire pressure warning valves and transmitters must be
installed. (→P. 567)

CAUTION

■When replacing wheels

●Do not use wheels that are a different size from those recommended in the

Owner’s Manual, as this may result in loss of handling control.

●Never use an inner tube in a leaking wheel which is designed for a tube-
less  tire.  Doing  so  may  result  in  an  accident,  causing  death  or  serious
injury.

■When installing the wheel nuts

●Be sure to install the wheel nuts with the
tapered  ends  facing  inward.  Installing
the  nuts  with  the  tapered  ends  facing
outward can cause wheel to break and
eventually cause the wheel to come off
while  driving,  which  could  lead  to  an
accident  resulting  in  death  or  serious
injury.

Tapered 
portion

●Never use oil or grease on the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.

Oil  and  grease  may  cause  the  wheel  nuts  to  be  excessively  tightened,
leading  to bolt or  disc wheel damage. In  addition, the oil  or  grease  can
cause the wheel nuts to loosen and the wheel may fall off, causing an acci-
dent  and  resulting  in  death  or  serious  injury.  Remove  any  oil  or  grease
from the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.
■Use of defective wheels prohibited

Do not use cracked or deformed wheels. 
Doing so could cause the tire to leak air during driving, possibly causing an
accident.

NOTICE

■Replacing tire pressure warning valves and transmitters (vehicles with

the tire pressure warning system)
●Because tire repair or replacement may affect the tire pressure warning
valves and transmitters, make sure to have tires serviced by any autho-
rized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer
or other qualified service shop. In addition, make sure to purchase your
tire  pressure  warning  valves  and  transmitters  at  any  authorized  Toyota
retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

●Ensure that only genuine Toyota wheels are used on your vehicle.

Tire pressure warning valves and transmitters may not work properly with
non-genuine wheels.

The headlight low beams (LED headlights), front position lights/daytime run-
ning lights (LED headlights), side turn signal lights, high mounted stoplight,
stop/tail lights consist of a number of LEDs. If any of the LEDs burn out, take
your vehicle to any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or
any reliable repairer to have the light replaced.

■Condensation build-up on the inside of the lens

Temporary condensation build-up on the inside of the headlight lens does not
indicate  a  malfunction.  Contact  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota
authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer for more information in the follow-
ing situations: 
●Large drops of water are built up on the inside of the lens.
●Water has built up inside the headlight.

CAUTION

■Replacing light bulbs

●Turn  off  the  headlights.  Do  not  attempt  to  replace  the  bulb  immediately

after turning off the headlights.
The bulbs become very hot and may cause burns.

●Do not touch the glass portion of the light bulb with bare hands. When it is
unavoidable to hold the glass portion, use and hold with a clean dry cloth
to avoid getting moisture and oils on the bulb.
Also, if the bulb is scratched or dropped, it may blow out or crack.

●Fully install light bulbs and any parts used to secure them. Failure to do so
may result in heat damage, fire, or water entering the headlight unit. This
may damage the headlights or cause condensation to build up on the lens.
●Do not attempt to repair or  disassemble light  bulbs, connectors, electric

circuits or component parts.
Doing so may result in death or serious injury due to electric shock.

■To prevent damage or fire

●Make sure bulbs are fully seated and locked.
●Check the wattage of the bulb before installing to prevent heat damage.

■The  tire  pressure  warning  light  may  come  on  due  to  natural  causes

(vehicles with the tire pressure warning system)
The tire pressure warning light may come on due to natural causes such as
natural air leaks and tire inflation pressure changes caused by temperature.
In this case, adjusting the tire inflation pressure will turn off the warning light
(after a few minutes).

■When a tire is replaced with a spare tire (vehicles with a spare tire and

the tire pressure warning system)
The tire pressure warning light will turn on if the tire inflation pressure of the
spare tire is low. If a tire goes flat, the tire pressure warning light will not turn
off even though the flat tire has been replaced with the spare tire.

■Conditions that the tire pressure warning system may not function prop-

erly (vehicles with the tire pressure warning system)
→P. 570

■If the tire pressure warning light frequently comes on after blinking for 1

minute (vehicles with the tire pressure warning system)
If  the  tire  pressure  warning  light  frequently  comes  on  after  blinking  for  1
minute when the engine switch is turned to the “ON” position (vehicles with-
out  a  smart  entry  &  start  system)  or  IGNITION  ON  mode  (vehicles  with  a
smart entry & start system), have it checked by any authorized Toyota retailer
or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

■Warning buzzer

In some cases, the buzzer may not be heard because of noisy place or an
audio sound.

CAUTION

■If both the ABS and the brake system warning lights remain on

Stop your vehicle in a safe place immediately and contact any authorized
Toyota  retailer or  Toyota authorized repairer,  or any reliable  repairer. The
vehicle will become extremely unstable during braking, and the ABS system
may fail, which could cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury.

■When the power steering system warning light comes on

The steering wheel may become extremely heavy.
If  the  steering  wheel  becomes  heavier  than  usual  when  operating,  hold
firmly and operate using more force than usual.

■If the tire pressure warning light comes on (vehicles with the tire pres-

sure warning system)
Be sure to observe the following precautions. Failure to do so could cause a
loss of vehicle control and result in death or serious injury.
●Stop your vehicle in a safe place as soon as possible. Adjust the tire infla-

tion pressure immediately. 

●If the tire pressure warning light comes on even after tire inflation pressure
adjustment, it is probable that you have a flat tire. Check the tires. If a tire
is flat, change it with the spare tire and have the flat tire repaired by the
nearest  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized  repairer,  or  any
reliable repairer.

●Avoid abrupt maneuvering and braking. If the vehicle tires deteriorate, you

could lose control of the steering wheel or the brakes.

■If a blowout or sudden air leakage should occur (vehicles with the tire

pressure warning system)
The tire pressure warning system may not activate immediately.

NOTICE

8

■To  ensure  the  tire  pressure  warning  system  operates  properly  (vehi-

cles with the tire pressure warning system)
Do not install tires with different specifications or makers, as the tire pres-
sure warning system may not operate properly.

■If the fuel filter warning light comes on

Never  drive  the  vehicle  with  the  warning  light  on.  Continued  driving  with
water accumulated in the fuel filter will damage the fuel injection pump.

■Using the tire jack

Improper use of the tire jack may cause the vehicle to suddenly fall off the
jack, leading to death or serious injury.
●Do not use the tire jack for any purpose other than replacing tires or install-

ing and removing tire chains.

●Only use the tire jack that comes with this vehicle for replacing a flat tire. 
Do not use it on other vehicles, and do not use other tire jacks for replac-
ing tires on this vehicle.

●Always check that the tire jack is securely set to the jack point.
●Do not put any part of your body under the vehicle while it is supported by

the jack.

●Do not start or run the engine while your vehicle is supported by the jack.
●Do not raise the vehicle while someone is inside.
●When raising the vehicle, do not put an object on or under the jack.
●Do not raise the vehicle to a height greater than that required to replace

the tire.

●Use a jack stand if it is necessary to get under the vehicle.
●Vehicles  with  rear  height  control  air  suspension:  Be  sure  to  turn  off  the

CAUTION

■Replacing a flat tire

●Observe the following precautions. 

Failure to do so may result in serious injury:
• Vehicles with under floor mounted spare tire: Lower the spare tire com-

pletely to the ground before removing it from under the vehicle.

• Do  not try to remove the wheel ornament  by hand.  Take due care in

handling the ornament to avoid unexpected personal injury. 

• Do not touch the disc wheels or the area around the brakes immediately

after the vehicle has been driven.
After the vehicle has been driven the disc wheels and the area around
the brakes will be extremely hot. Touching these areas with hands, feet
or other body parts while changing a tire, etc. may result in burns.

●Failure to follow these precautions could cause the wheel nuts to loosen

and the tire to fall off, resulting in death or serious injury.
• Have  the  wheel  nuts  tightened  with  a  torque  wrench  to  112 N•m
(11.4 kgf•m, 83 ft•lbf) steel wheels, 103 N•m (10.5 kgf•m, 76 ft•lbf) alu-
minum wheels, as soon as possible after changing wheels.
Failure to follow these precautions could cause the nuts to loosen and
the wheel may fall off, which could lead to an accident causing death or
serious injury.

• Do not attach a heavily damaged wheel ornament, as it may fly off the

wheel while the vehicle is moving.

• If there are any cracks or deformations in the bolt screws, nut threads or
bolt holes of the wheel, have the vehicle inspected by any authorized
Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

• When installing a tire, only use wheel nuts that have been specifically

• When installing the wheel nuts, be sure to install them with the tapered

8-2. Steps to take in an emergency

If you have a flat tire (vehicles without 
a spare tire)

Your  vehicle  is  not  equipped  with  a  spare  tire,  but  instead  is
equipped with an emergency tire puncture repair kit.
A puncture caused by a nail or screw passing through the tire
tread can be repaired temporarily with the emergency tire punc-
ture repair kit.

CAUTION

■If you have a flat tire

Do not continue driving with a flat tire. 
Driving even a short distance with a flat tire can damage the tire and the
wheel beyond repair, which could result in an accident.
Driving with a flat tire may cause a circumferential groove on the side wall.
In such a case, the tire may explode when using a repair kit.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

8-2. Steps to take in an emergency

673

Before repairing the vehicle
● Stop the vehicle in a safe place on a hard, flat surface.
● Set the parking brake.
● Shift  the  shift  lever  to  P  (automatic  transmission)  or  N  (manual

transmission).

● Turn off the rear height control air suspension (if equipped).

(→Refer to the “Off-road Driving Owner’s Manual”)

● Stop the engine.
● Turn on the emergency flashers. (→P. 614)
● Check the degree of the tire damage.

A  tire  should  only  be  repaired
with  the  emergency  tire  punc-
ture  repair  kit  if  the  damage  is
caused by a nail or screw pass-
ing through the tire tread.
• Do  not  remove  the  nail  or
screw  from  the  tire.  Remov-
ing the object may widen the
opening and disenable emer-
gency repair with the kit.

• To avoid sealant leakage, move the vehicle until the area of the

puncture, if known, is positioned at the top of the tire.

■A flat tire that cannot be repaired with the emergency tire repair kit

In  the  following  cases,  the  tire cannot  be  repaired  with  the  emergency  tire
puncture repair kit. Contact any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota autho-
rized repairer, or any reliable repairer.
●When the tire is damaged due to driving without sufficient air pressure
●When the tire lost air pressure due to a crack or damage in the tire sidewall
●When the tire is visibly separated from the wheel
●When the cut or damage to the tread is 4 mm (0.16 in.) long or more
●When the wheel is damaged
●When two or more tires have been punctured
●When there is more than one hole or cut in the damaged tire

display  the  actual  tire  infla-
tion pressure about 1 minute
after the switch is turned on.
• Turn  the  compressor  switch
off  and  then  check  the  tire
inflation 
pressure.  Being
careful  not  to  over  inflate,
check and repeat the inflation
procedure  until  the  recom-
mended tire inflation pressure
is reached.

• If  the  needle  of the  air pressure  gauge reaches  the  red  zone  (450
kPa [4.5 kgf/cm2 or bar, 65 psi] or more), there may be a malfunction
in the tire or in the kit itself. Stop operation immediately.

• If the tire inflation pressure is still lower than the recommended level
after inflation for 10 minutes with the switch on, the tire is too dam-
aged to be repaired. Turn the compressor switch off and contact any
authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reli-
able repairer.

• If the tire inflation pressure exceeds the recommended level, let out

some air to adjust the tire inflation pressure. (→P. 686)

■Emergency tire puncture repair kit

●The sealant has a limited lifespan. The expiry date is marked on the bottle.
The sealant should be replaced before the expiry date. Contact any autho-
rized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer for
replacement.

●The sealant  stored  in  the  emergency tire puncture repair  kit can be used
only once to temporarily repair a single tire. If the sealant in the bottle and
other parts of the kit have been used and need to be purchased, contact any
authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized  repairer,  or  any  reliable
repairer.

●The sealant can be used when the outside temperature is from -30 °C (-22

°F) to 60 °C (140 °F).

●The kit is exclusively designed for size and type of tires originally installed
on your vehicle. Do not use it for tires that a different size than the original
ones, or for any other purposes.

●If the sealant gets on your clothes, it may stain.
●If the sealant adheres to a wheel or the surface of the vehicle body, the stain
may not be removable if it is not cleaned at once. Immediately wipe away
the sealant with a wet cloth.

●During operation of the kit, a loud operation noise is produced. This does

not indicate a malfunction.

Disconnect the hose from the valve.
Install the air release cap to the end of
the hose and push the protrusion on the
air  release  cap  into  the  valve  to  let
some air out.

Disconnect the hose from the valve, remove the air release cap from the
hose and then reconnect the hose.
Turn the compressor switch on and wait for several seconds, then turn it
off.  Check  that  the  air  pressure  indicator  shows  the  recommended  level.
(→P. 735)
If the air pressure is lower than the recommended level, turn the compres-
sor  switch  on  again  and  repeat  the  inflation  procedure  until  the  recom-
mended pressure is reached.

■After a tire is repaired with the emergency tire puncture repair kit
●The tire pressure warning valve and transmitter should be replaced.
●Even if the tire inflation pressure is at the recommended level, the tire pres-
sure warning light may come on/flash. (vehicles with the tire pressure warn-
ing system)

CAUTION

■Precautions for use of the sealant

●Ingesting  the  sealant is hazardous to  your  health.  If you  ingest sealant,

consume as much water as possible, then immediately consult a doctor.

●If  sealant  gets  in  eyes  or  adheres  to  skin,  immediately  wash  it  off  with

water. If discomfort persists, consult a doctor.

LC150_OM_OM60P18E_(EE)

8-2. Steps to take in an emergency

687

CAUTION

■When fixing the flat tire

●Stop your vehicle in a safe and flat area.
●Connect the valve and hose securely with the tire installed on the vehicle.
●If the hose is not properly connected to the valve, air leakage may occur or

sealant may be sprayed out.

●If the hose comes off the valve while inflating the tire, there is a risk that

the hose will move abruptly due to air pressure.

●After inflation of the tire has completed, the sealant may splatter when the

hose is disconnected or some air is let out of the tire.

●Keep back from the tire while it is being repaired, as there is a chance of it
bursting while the repair operation is being performed. If you notice any
cracks or deformation of the tire, turn off the compressor switch and stop
the repair operation immediately.

●The kit may overheat if operated for a long period of time. Do not operate

the compressor continuously for more than 20 minutes.

●Parts of the kit become hot during operation. Be careful handling the kit

during and after operation.

●Do not attach the vehicle speed warning sticker to an area other than the
one indicated. If the sticker is attached to an area where an SRS airbag is
located, such as the pad of the steering wheel, it may prevent the SRS air
bag from operating properly.

■Driving to spread the liquid sealant evenly

●Drive the vehicle carefully at a low speed. Be especially careful when turn-

ing and cornering.

●If the vehicle does not drive straight or you feel a pull through the steering

wheel, stop the vehicle and check the following:
• Tire condition. The tire may have separated from the wheel.
• Tire inflation pressure. If tire inflation pressure is 130 kPa (1.3 kgf/cm2

or bar, 19 psi) or below, this may indicate severe tire damage.

■Starting  the  engine  when  the  battery  is  discharged  (vehicles  with  an

automatic transmission)
The engine cannot be started by push-starting.

■To prevent battery discharge

●Turn off the headlights and the audio system while the engine is off.
●Turn off any unnecessary electrical components when the vehicle is running

at a low speed for an extended period, such as in heavy traffic.

■Charging the battery 

The electricity stored in the battery will discharge gradually even when the
vehicle is not in use, due to natural discharge and the draining effects of cer-
tain electrical appliances. If the vehicle is left for a long time, the battery may
discharge,  and  the  engine  may  be  unable  to  start.  (The  battery  recharges
automatically during driving.)

■When recharging or replacing the battery (vehicles with a smart entry &

start system)
●In some cases, it may not be possible to unlock the doors using the smart
entry  &  start  system  when  the  battery  is  discharged.  Use  the  wireless
remote control or the mechanical key to lock or unlock the doors.

●The engine may not start on the first attempt after the battery has recharged

but will start normally after the second attempt. This is not a malfunction.

●The engine switch mode is memorized by the vehicle. When the battery is
reconnected, the system will return to the mode it was in before the battery
was discharged. Before disconnecting the battery, turn the engine switch off.
If you are unsure what mode the engine switch was in before the battery dis-
charged, be especially careful when reconnecting the battery.

CAUTION

■Avoiding battery fires or explosions

Observe the following precautions to prevent accidentally igniting the flam-
mable gas that may be emitted from the battery:
●Make sure the jumper cable is connected to the correct terminal and that it
is not unintentionally in contact with any other than the intended terminal.
●Do not allow the + and - clamps of the jumper cables to come into contact

with each other.

●Do not smoke, use matches, cigarette lighters or allow open flame near

the battery.

■Battery precautions

The  battery  contains  poisonous  and  corrosive  acidic  electrolyte,  while
related parts contain lead and lead compounds. Observe the following pre-
cautions when handling the battery:
●When working with the battery, always wear safety glasses and take care
not to allow any battery fluids (acid) to come into contact with skin, clothing
or the vehicle body.

●Do not lean over the battery.
●In  the  event  that  battery  fluid  comes  into  contact  with  the  skin  or  eyes,
immediately wash the affected area with water and seek medical attention.
Place a wet sponge or cloth over the affected area until medical attention
can be received.

●Always wash your hands after handling the battery support, terminals, and

other battery-related parts.

●Do not allow children near the battery.

■To prevent damaging the vehicle (vehicles with a manual transmission)
Do not pull- or push-start the vehicle, because the catalytic converter may
overheat and become a fire hazard.

NOTICE

■When handling jumper cables

When connecting the jumper cables, ensure that they do not become entan-
gled in the cooling fans or belt.

■To prevent damage to the engine cover

●When removing the cover, make sure that you pull the cover towards you

after lifting the front edge to remove the fixed pins.

●When  installing  the  cover,  do  not  force  the  cover  or  subject  it  to  strong

shocks.

Add  coolant  slowly  after  the  engine  has  cooled  down  sufficiently.  Adding
cool coolant to a hot engine too quickly can cause damage to the engine.

■To prevent damage to the cooling system

Observe the following precautions:
●Avoid contaminating the coolant with foreign matter (such as sand or dust

etc.).

If you run out of fuel and the engine stalls 
(diesel engine only)

If you run out of fuel and the engine stalls:

1

2

3

Refuel your vehicle.
To bleed the fuel system, oper-
ate  the  priming pump  until  you
feel more resistance.

Start the engine. (→P. 246, 249)
If the engine does not start after the above steps have been performed,
wait for 10 seconds and try step 
 again. If the engine still does
not  start,  contact  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer.

 and

3

After starting the engine, depress the accelerator pedal lightly until the
engine runs smoothly.

NOTICE

■When restarting the engine

●Do not crank the engine before refueling and operating the priming pump.

This may damage the engine and fuel system.

●Do not crank the engine for more than 30 seconds at a time. This may

overheat the starter and wiring system.

5

Stop the engine. Set the parking brake and put the shift lever in P
(automatic transmission) or N (manual transmission).
Remove the mud, snow, or sand from around the stuck tire.
Place wood, stones or some other material to help provide traction
under the tires.
Restart the engine.
Shift  the  shift  lever  to  D  or  R  (automatic  transmission)  or  1  or  R
(manual transmission) and release the parking brake. Then, while
exercising caution, depress the accelerator pedal.

■When it is difficult to free the vehicle

Turn off TRC and/or VSC if these functions are hampering your attempts to
free the vehicle. (→P. 374)

CAUTION

■When attempting to free a stuck vehicle

If you choose to push the vehicle back and forth to free it, make sure the
surrounding area is clear, to avoid striking other vehicles, objects or people.
The vehicle may also lunge forward or lunge back suddenly as it becomes
free. Use extreme caution.

■When shifting the shift lever

For vehicles with an automatic transmission, be careful not to shift the shift
lever with the accelerator pedal depressed.
This  may  lead  to  unexpected  rapid  acceleration  of  the  vehicle  that  may
cause an accident and result in death or serious injury.

NOTICE

■To avoid damaging the transmission and other components

●Avoid  spinning  the  wheels  and  depressing  the  accelerator  pedal  more

than necessary.

●If the vehicle remains stuck even after these procedures are performed,

the vehicle may require towing to be freed.

●Vehicles  with  the  multi-information  display  type  A:  When  the  automatic
transmission fluid temperature warning light comes on while attempting to
free a  stuck  vehicle, immediately  remove your foot  from  the accelerator
pedal and wait until the warning light turns off. Otherwise, the transmission
may become damaged. (→P. 627)

●Vehicles with the multi-information display type C: When a warning mes-
sage for the automatic transmission fluid temperature is displayed while
attempting to free a stuck vehicle, immediately remove your foot from the
accelerator pedal and wait until the warning message disappears. Other-
wise, the transmission may become damaged. (→P. 640)

If  SAE  0W-20  oil  is  not  avail-

9-1. Specifications

Recommended viscosity (SAE):
SAE  0W-30  is  filled  into  your
Toyota  vehicle  at  manufactur-
ing,  and  the  best  choice  for
good  fuel  economy  and  good
starting in cold weather.

Preferred

Temperature range anticipated 
before next oil change

Oil viscosity (0W-30 is explained here as an example):
• The  0W  in  0W-30  indicates  the  characteristic  of  the  oil  which
allows cold startability. Oils with a lower value before the W allow
for easier starting of the engine in cold weather.

• The 30 in 0W-30 indicates the viscosity characteristic of the oil
when the oil is at high temperature. An oil with a higher viscosity
(one with a higher value) may be better suited if the vehicle is
operated at high speeds, or under extreme load conditions.

■Notice on fuel quality

●Do not use improper fuels. If improper fuels are used, the engine will be

damaged.

●Gasoline engine: Do not use leaded gasoline.

Leaded  gasoline  will  cause  the  three-way  catalytic  converter  to  lose  its
effectiveness and the emission control system to function improperly.

●Gasoline  engine  (EU  area):  Bioethanol  fuel  sold  under  names  such  as
“E50” or “E85” and fuel containing a large amount of ethanol should not be
used. The use of these fuels will damage the vehicle’s fuel system. In case
of  any  doubt,  ask  any  authorized  Toyota  retailer  or  Toyota  authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer.

●Gasoline engine (except EU area): Bioethanol fuel sold under names such
as “E50” or “E85” and fuel containing a large amount of ethanol should not
be used. Your vehicle can use gasoline mixed with 10 % max ethanol. The
use of fuel with more than 10 % ethanol content (E10) will damage the
vehicle’s fuel system. You must ensure that refueling is carried out only
from a source where fuel specification and quality can be guaranteed. In
case of any doubt, ask any authorized Toyota retailer or Toyota authorized
repairer, or any reliable repairer.

●Diesel engine (EU area): FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) fuel sold under
names  such  as  “B30”  or  “B100”  and  fuel  containing  a  large  amount  of
FAME should not be used. The use of these fuels will damage the vehi-
cle’s fuel system. In case of any doubt, ask any authorized Toyota retailer
or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

●Diesel engine (except EU area): FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) fuel sold
under names such as “B30” or “B100” and fuel containing a large amount
of FAME should not be used. Your vehicle can use diesel mixed with 5 %
max biodiesel FAME (B5). The use of fuel with more than 5 % FAME con-
tent (B5) will damage the vehicle’s fuel system. You must ensure that refu-
eling is carried out only from a source where fuel specification and quality
can  be  guaranteed.  In  case  of  any  doubt,  ask  any  authorized  Toyota
retailer or Toyota authorized repairer, or any reliable repairer.

●Do not use the methanol blended gasoline such as M15, M85, M100. The
