OWNER´ S MANUAL

SIMPLY CLEVER

How you can contribute to a cleaner environment

The fuel consumption of your Škoda - and thus the level of pol-
lutants contained in the exhaust - is also determined by how 
you drive.

The noise level and wear and tear are also influenced by how 
you personally handle your vehicle.  This Owner ´s Manual tells 
you how to drive your Škoda to achieve the minimum impact 
on the environment, and how to save money at the same time. 
Look up „Environment“ in the Index to find out more.

Please also refer to all the texts identified with a ; in this 
Owner ´s Manual.

Make your contribution - for the sake of the environ-
ment.

Introduction

On-board literature
The on-board literature for your vehicle consists of this “Owner's 
Manual” as well as the brochures “Quick Reference Guide”, “Service 
Schedule” and “Help on the road”. There can also be a variety of other 
additional operating manuals and instructions on-board (e.g. an oper-
ating manual for the radio) depending on the vehicle model and equip-
ment.

If one of the publications listed above is missing, please contact a Škoda 
Service Partner immediately, where one will be glad to assist you in such 
matters.

One should note that the details given in the vehicle's papers always 
take precedence over those in the Owner's Manual.

Owner's Manual
This Owner's Manual describes the current scope of equipment. 
Certain items of equipment listed are only installed later on and only 
envisaged for particular markets. The illustrations can differ in minor 
details from your vehicle; they are only intended for general information.

In addition to information regarding all the controls and equipment, the 
Owner's Manual also contains important information regarding care and 
operation for your safety and also to retain the value of your vehicle. To 
provide you with valuable tips and aids. You can learn how how you can 
operate your vehicle safely, economically and in an environmentally 
conscious way.

For safety reasons, please also pay attention to the information on 
accessories, modifications and replacement of parts ⇒ page 205.

The other chapters of the Owner's Manual are also important, however, 
for proper treatment of your car - in addition to regular care and mainte-
nance - helps to retain its value and in many cases is also one of the 
conditions for possible warranty claims.

The Brief instruction
includes an overview of the most important controls of your vehicle.

The Service schedule
contains:
• Vehicle data,
• Service intervals,
• Overview of the service work,
• Service proof,
• Confirmation of mobility warranty,
• important information on the warranty.
The confirmations of the carried out service work are one of the condi-
tions for possible warranty claims.

Please always present the Service schedule when you take your car to a 
Škoda Service Partner.

If the Service schedule is missing or worn, please contact your Škoda 
Service Partner, where your car is serviced regularly. You will receive a 
duplicate, in which the previously carried out service work are confirmed.

Layout of this Owner's Manual (explanations)

Layout of this Owner's Manual (explanations)
The Owner's Manual has been systematically designed, in order to make it easy for 
you to find and absorb the information you require.

WARNING

Chapters, table of contents and subject index
The text of the manual are divided into relatively short sections which are combined 
into easy-to-read chapters. The chapter you are reading at any particular moment 
is highlighted at the bottom right of the page.

The Table of contents is arranged according to the chapters and the detailed 
Subject index at the end of the Owner's Manual helps you to rapidly find the infor-
mation you are looking for.

Sections
The majority of Sections apply to all models.

Since there is a wide range of different equipment and options available it is clearly 
unavoidable, despite dividing the contents into sections, that mention may be 
made of equipment which is not fitted to your vehicle.

Equipment which is marked * is only standard on certain vehicle model versions or 
only suppliable as optional equipment for certain models.

Brief information and instructions
Each section has a Heading.

This is followed by Brief information (in large italic lettering), which tells you the 
subject which is dealt with in this section.

Most of the illustrations are accompanied by an Instruction (in relatively large 
letters) which explains to you in a straightforward way the action you have to take. 
Work steps which have to be carried out are illustrated with a hyphen.

Notes
All four kinds of notes, which are used in the text, are always stated at the end of the 
respective section.

The most important notes are marked with the heading Warning. These 
Warning notes draw your attention to a serious risk of accident or injury. 
While reading the text you will frequently encounter a double arrow 
followed by a small warning symbol. This symbol is intended to draw your 
attention to a Warning note at the end of the section to which you must pay 
careful attention.

Caution

A Caution note draws your attention to the possibility of damage to your vehicle 
(e.g. damage to gearbox), or points out general risks of an accident.

For the sake of the environment

An Environmental note draws your attention to environmental protection aspects. 
This is where you will, for example, find tips aimed at reducing your fuel consump-
tion.

Note

A normal Note draws your attention in a general way to important information.

Direction indications
All direction indications such as “left”, “right”, “front”, “rear” relate to the direction 
of travel of the vehicle.

Instruments and Indicator/Warning Lights

Engine revolutions counter

 ⇒ page 11, fig. 2 indicates 
The start of the red zone in the revolutions counter 
the maximum permissible engine speed for all gears for an engine which has been 
run in and operating at a normal temperature. You should shift into the next higher 
gear before this red zone is reached, or move the selector lever into position D if 
your car is fitted with an automatic gearbox.

A1

One should shift to the next lower gear at the latest when the engine is no longer 
running “smoothly”.
Avoid high engine speeds during the running-in period ⇒ page 162.

Caution

The operating range
The engine has reached its operating temperature as soon as the pointer moves 
into the mid-range of the scale. The pointer may also move further to the right at 
high engine loads and high outside temperatures. This is not critical provided the 
warning symbol  in the instrument cluster does not flash.
If the symbol  in the instrument cluster flashes it means that either the coolant 
temperature is too high or the coolant level is too low. Please refer to the guide-
lines ⇒ page 26, “Coolant temperature, Coolant quantity ”.

WARNING

Pay attention to the warning notes ⇒ page 185, “Working in the engine 
compartment” before opening the bonnet and inspecting the coolant level.

The needle of the revolutions counter must on no account move into the red zone 
of the scale - risk of engine damage!

Caution

For the sake of the environment

Shifting up early helps you save fuel and reduce the operating noise of your 
vehicle.

Coolant temperature gauge

The coolant temperature gauge 
tion is switched on.

In order to avoid any damage to the engine, please pay attention to the following 
notes regarding the temperature ranges:

Cold range
If the pointer is in the left-hand area of the scale it means that the engine has not 
yet reached its operating temperature. Avoid running at high engine speeds, at full 
throttle and at severe engine loads.

Additional headlights and other attached components in front of the fresh air inlet 
impair the cooling efficiency of the coolant. There is then a risk of the engine over-
heating at high outside temperatures and high engine loads!

Fuel gauge

A3

 ⇒ page 11, fig. 2 only operates when the ignition is switched on.
The fuel gauge 
The fuel tank has a capacity of about 62 litres. The warning symbol  in the instru-
ment cluster lights up when the pointer reaches the reserve marking. There are now 
about 8 litres of fuel remaining in the tank. This symbol is a reminder for you, that 
you must refuel.

The following will be displayed in the information display*:

PLEASE REFUEL

A peep sounds as an additional warning signal.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 13  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

Caution

Never run the fuel tank completely empty! An irregular fuel supply can result in 
poor ignition or misfiring. Unburnt fuel may get into the exhaust system and 
damage the catalytic converter.

distance driven

The distance which you have driven with your vehicle is shown in kilometres (km). 
On certain model versions, the readout is shown in “miles”.

Bottom counter (trip counter) for distance driven
The bottom counter indicates the distance which you have driven since this 
counter was last reset - in steps of 100 metres or 1/10 of a mile. It can be reset to 
zero by pressing the reset button next to the trip counter ⇒ fig. 4.

Top counter for distance driven
The top counter for distance driven indicates the total distance in kilometres or 
miles which the vehicle has been driven.

Fault display
dEF will appear as a constant text in the display field of the counter for distance 
driven if there is a fault in the instrument cluster. Have the fault rectified as soon as 
possible by a specialist workshop.

Warning against excessive speeds*
An acoustic warning signal will sound when the vehicle speed exceeds 120 kilome-
tres per hour. The acoustic warning signal will switch off again when the vehicle 
speed goes below this speed limit.

This function is only valid for some countries.

SERVICE NOW

The display disappears within 20 seconds after starting the engine. The trip counter 
is also displayed after pressing the reset button of the trip counter (for more than 1 
second).

Resetting Service Interval Display
We recommend having this resetting performed by a specialist garage.

The specialist garage:
• resets the memory of the display after the appropriate inspection,
• makes an entry in the Service schedule,
• affix the sticker with the entry of the following service interval to the side of the 
dash panel on the driver's side.

It is also possible for you to reset the Service Interval Display with the reset button 
AB
 ⇒ fig. 5 as follows (does not apply to models with fixed service intervals - QG2).
• Switch off the ignition (if not already off), press the reset button 
down.
• Switch the ignition on and release the reset button

• it is necessary to re-code the Service Interval Display if a new instrument cluster 
is installed during repair work. This work is carried out by a specialist garage.
• After resetting the display with flexible service intervals (QG1) using the reset 
button 
, the data displayed are the same as for a car with fixed service intervals 
(QG2). We therefore recommend having the Service Interval Display reset only by a 
Škoda Service Partner who is familiar with the procedure for resetting the display 
with a vehicle system tester.

Single-trip memory (memory 1)
The single-trip memory collates the driving information from the moment the igni-
tion is switched on until it is switched off. New data will also flow into the calcula-
tion of the current driving information if the trip is continued within 2 hours after 
switching off the ignition. The memory will be is automatically erased, on the other 
hand, if the trip is interrupted for more than 2 hours.

Total-trip memory (memory 2)
The total distance driven memory gathers data from any number of individual jour-
neys up to a total of 99 hours and 59 minutes driving or 9.999 kilometres driven. 
The memory is deleted when either of these limits is reached and the calculation 
starts from anew.

The total-trip memory will not, contrary to the single-trip memory, be deleted after 
a period of interruption of driving of 2 hours.

Note

All information in the memory is erased if the battery of the vehicle is

specialist garage by adopting a gentle style of driving.

The following text will be displayed in the information display*:

ENGINE WORKSHOP! (ENGINE FAULT - WORKSHOP!)

Diesel particle filter*  (diesel engine)

If the warning light  comes on, this means that soot has accumulated in the diesel 
particle filter because of the frequent short distances.

In order to clean the diesel particle filter, the vehicle should be driven at an even 
speed of at least 60 km/h at engine speeds of 1 800 - 2 500 rpm for 15 minutes or 
until the warning light goes out with the 4th or 5th gear engaged (automatic 
gearbox: position S) when the traffic situation permits it. This increases the exhaust 
temperature and the soot deposited in the diesel particle filter is burnt.

• If you do not pay attention to the warning light coming on and the corre-
sponding descriptions and warning notes, this may result in injuries or 
major vehicle damage.
• Always adjust your speed to suit weather, road, region and traffic condi-
tions. The route indicated by the warning light must not tempt you to disre-
gard the national regulations for road traffic.

Caution

As long as the warning light  lights up, one must take into account an increased 
fuel consumption and in certain circumstances a power reduction of the engine.

Note

• The servicing of the diesel particle filter and the replenishing of the additive are 
performed by a specialist garage in the framework of the regular inspection, see 
Service shedule.

only for a short time. This is particularly important if children are left in the 
vehicle. The children might otherwise start the engine or operate electrical 
equipment (e.g. power windows) - risk of injury!
• Do not withdraw the ignition key from the ignition lock until the vehicle 
has come to a stop. The steering lock might otherwise engage unintention-
ally - risk of accident!

Caution

• Each key contains electronic components; therefore protect them against mois-
ture and severe shocks.
• Keep the groove of the keys absolutely clean as impurities (textile fibres, dust 
etc.) have a negative effect on proper operation of the keys and the ignition lock.

Note

Please approach a Škoda Service Partner if you lose a key since he can obtain a new 
one for you.

even after replacing the battery this means that the system has to be synchronised 
⇒ page 39.

Electronic immobiliser 
The electronic immobiliser prevents the vehicle being operated by an 
unauthorised person.

An electronic chip is integrated in the head of the key. The immobiliser is deacti-
vated with the aid of this chip when the key is inserted in the ignition lock. The elec-
tronic immobiliser is automatically activated when you withdraw the ignition key 
from the lock.

Central locking system

Description

Unlocking or locking the vehicle causes all doors to be unlocked or locked at the 
same time by the central locking system. The boot lid is unlocked when opening. It 
can be opened by pressing the hand grip above the licence plate.

Operation of the central locking system is possible:
• from the outside using the vehicle key ⇒ page 34
• using the buttons for the central locking system ⇒ page 35
• by using the radio remote control ⇒ page 37
Convenience operation of windows
One can open and close the electrically powered windows when unlocking and 
locking the vehicle ⇒ page 42, “Window convenience operation”. The electric 
sliding/tilting roof* can only be closed by the central locking system.

Opening a single door*
This function allows one to just unlock the driver's door. The other doors remain 
locked and are only unlocked when the command is repeated. The single door 
opening function can be first activated by recoding the control unit of the central 
locking system. This work is undertaken by a Škoda Service Partner can give you 
more information.

Automatic locking*
All the doors and the boot lid are locked automatically once the car reaches a speed 
of about 15 km/h.

If the ignition key is withdrawn, the car is then automatically unlocked again. In 
addition, it is possible for the driver to unlock the car by pressing the central locking 
button  or by pulling the door opening lever.

Unlocking and locking

If you wish, your Škoda Service Partner can convert the central locking system of 
your car to the automatic locking mode.

The safe securing system is again activated the next time the vehicle is unlocked and 
locked again.

WARNING

Locking the doors prevents involuntary opening in an exceptional situation 
(an accident). Locked doors prevent unwanted entry into the vehicle from 
outside, for example at road crossings. Locked doors do, however, make it 
more difficult for rescuers to get into the vehicle in an emergency - danger to 
life!

Note

• After unlocking the vehicle see, if the securing knobs are located on all doors at 
the bottom.
• In the event of an accident in which the airbags are deployed, the locked doors 
are automatically unlocked in order to enable rescuers to gain access to the vehicle.
• Should the central locking system not operate properly, you can lock and unlock 
the front doors and the boot lid with the key. Emergency unlocking of fuel filler flap 
⇒ page 183.

The doors can be opened from the inside if the vehicle is locked and the safe 
securing system is deactivated:
• The door is unlocked by actuating the door-opening lever.
• The door opens upon actuating the door-opening lever again.

WARNING

If the vehicle is locked from the outside and the safe securing system is acti-
vated, there must not be any person and animals in the vehicle as it is then 
not possible to open either a door or a window from the inside. The locked 
doors make it more difficult for rescuers to get into the vehicle in an emer-
gency - hazard!

Note

The anti-theft alarm system is also armed when the car is closed without activating 
the safe securing system. In this case, always switch off the interior monitoring 
sensor* ⇒ page 40 first of all to avoid an alarm being triggered unintentionally.

Safe securing

Unlocking the vehicle using the key

The central locking system is equipped with a safe securing system. Locking the 
vehicle from the outside causes the door locks to be automatically blocked. It is not 
possible to pull out the locking buttons. The indicator light in the driver's door 
flashes. It is not possible to open the doors with the door handle either from the 
inside or from the outside. This acts as an effective deterrent for attempts to break 
into your vehicle.

You can deactivate the safe securing system. This is done by locking the vehicle with 
the key or radio-operated key twice within 2 seconds.

Deactivating the safe securing system means that the warning light next to the 
securing knob in the driver's door will not flash. This is not the case, however, for an 
activated anti-theft alarm system* since the indicator light is showing that the 
system is active ⇒ page 39.

The transmitter with the battery is housed in the handle of the master key. The 
receiver is located in the interior of the car. The operating range of the remote 
control is 10 metres but this range can be reduced if the batteries are weak.

The master key has a fold-open key bit which can be used for unlocking and locking 
the car manually and also for starting the engine.

If a lost key is replaced or if the receiver unit has been repaired or a new unit 
installed, it is then necessary for a Škoda Service Partner to initialise the system. 
Only after this is it possible to again use the remote control.

Note

• The remote control is automatically deactivated when the ignition is switched 
on.
• The operation of the remote control may temporarily be affected by interfer-
ence from transmitters close to the car and which operate in the same frequency 
range (e.g. mobile phone, TV transmitter).
• The battery must be replaced, ideally by a Škoda Service Partner, if the central 
locking or anti-theft alarm system does react to the remote control at less than 3 
metres away.

synchronised. This can occur when the buttons on the radio-operated key are actu-
ated a number of times outside of the operative range of the equipment or the 
battery on the remote control was replaced.

This means it is necessary to synchronise the code as follows:
• Press any button on the remote control.
• pressing of the button means that the door will unlock with the key within 1 
minute.

Low beam comes on only if the ignition is switched on. The low beam is switched 
off automatically when the engine is started and after switching the ignition off; 
only the side lights come on.

On models fitted with right-hand steering* the position of certain switches differs 
from that shown in ⇒ fig. 34. The symbols which mark the switch positions are 
identical, however.

In certain countries, the low beam is on a reduced brightness as well as the side 
lights, when the ignition is switched on.

WARNING

Never drive with side lights on - risk of accident! The side lights are not 
bright enough to light up the road sufficiently in front of you or to be seen by 
other oncoming traffic. In this case, always switch on the low beam when it 
is dark or if visibility is reduced.

Note

• An audible warning will sound if you withdraw the ignition key and open the 
driver's door when the vehicle lights are still on.
• The acoustic warning signal is switched off over the door contact when the 
driver's door is closed (ignition off). The vehicle can be parked with the side lights 
on.
• If you park the car for a lengthy period, we recommend switching off all lights, 
or leaving only the side lights switched on.
• The switching on of the described lights should only be undertaken in accord-
ance with the legal requirements.
• In the event of cool or humid weather conditions, the headlights can be misted 
up from inside.

− The temperature difference between interior and external area of the head-
light lenses is decisive.
− When the driving lights are switched on, the light outlet surfaces are free 
from mist after a short period. The headlight lenses can possibly mist up at the 
border areas.

preserving wax.

Juddering or smearing of the wiper blades could then be due to wax residues left 
on the windscreen by vehicle washing in automatic vehicle wash systems. It is 
therefore important to degrease the lips of the wiper blades after every pass 
through an automatic vehicle wash system.

rior mirror is also stored automatically when the seat position is stored ⇒ page 61.

WARNING

• Convex (curved outward) or a spherical exterior mirrors increase the 
vision field. They do, however, make objects appear smaller in the mirror. 
These mirrors are only of limited use, therefore, for estimating distances to 
the following vehicles.
• Use whenever possible the interior rear mirror, for estimating the 
distances to the following vehicles.

Caution

If the mirror housing has been shifted out of position as a result of external force 
(e.g. striking an object when parking), the mirror must then be folded in fully with 
the electric motor. On no account attempt to move the mirror housing back by 
hand otherwise proper operation of the mirror mechanism will be affected. This

Seats and Stowage

Front seats

Basic information

The front seats have a wide range of different settings and can thus be matched to 
the physical characteristics of the driver and front passenger. Correct adjustment of 
the seats is particularly important for
• safely and quickly reaching the controls,
• a relaxed, fatigue-free body position,
• achieving the maximum protection offered by the seat belts and the airbag 
system.

The chapters which follow describe the procedure which you should adopt for 
adjusting the seats.

WARNING

• Never transport more occupants than the maximum seating in the 
vehicle.
• Each occupant must correctly fasten the seat belt belonging to the seat. 
Children must be fastened ⇒ page 146, “Transporting children safely” with 
a suitable restraint system.
• The front seats and the head restraints must always be adjusted to match 
the body size of the seat occupant as well as the seat belts must always be 
correctly fastened in order to provide an optimal protection for you and your 
occupants.
• Always keep your feet in the footwell when the car is being driven - never 
place your feet on the instrument panel, out of the window or on the 
surfaces of the seats. This is particularly important for the front seat 
passenger. You will be exposed to increased risk of injury if it becomes 
necessary to apply the brake or in the event of an accident. If an airbag is 
deployed, you may suffer fatal injuries when adopting an incorrect seated 
position!

Seats and Stowage

59

WARNING (continued)

• It is important for the driver and front passenger to maintain a distance 
of at least 25 cm from the steering wheel or dash panel. Not maintaining this 
minimum distance will mean that the airbag system will not be able to prop-
erly protect you - hazard! The front seats and the head restraints must 
always also be correctly adjusted to match the body size of the occupant.
• Ensure that there are no objects in the footwell as any objects may get 
behind the pedals during a driving or braking manoeuvre. You would then 
no longer be able to operate the clutch, to brake or accelerate.

Note

• When storing settings with the memory buttons, we recommend that you begin 
with the front button and assign a memory button to each additional driver.
• Each new setting stored with the same button erases the previous setting.
• Each time you store the seat and exterior mirror settings for driving forward you 
also have to re-store the individual setting of the exterior mirror on the passenger 
side for reversing.

Assigning remote control to the memory buttons

After storing the settings of the seat and exterior mirrors, you have 10 
seconds in order to assign the remote control to the appropriate memory 
button.

– Withdraw the ignition key.
– Press the release button ⇒ page 38 and hold it pressed for 1 second 
until an audible signal confirms that the setting has been stored. The 
setting is stored with the memory button which you have selected.

If you wish to be able to retrieve the settings which are stored in the memory by also 
using the remote control, you have to assign the remote control to a memory 
button in each case.

We recommend that you assign one of the two remote controls supplied with your 
car, to the front memory button, and the other remote control key to the middle 
memory button.

If you wish, you can obtain an additional key with radio remote control from a 
Škoda Service Partner and then assign the radio remote control to the rear memory 
button.

Note

• If the remote control had previously been assigned to another memory button, 
this setting is then erased by the new assignment.

• If you assign the remote control to a memory button which has already been 
assigned to a remote control, the old assignment is also replaced by a new assign-
ment in this case.
• The assignment of the remote control to a memory button is retained, however, 
after reassigning the seats and exterior mirrors.

Retrieving seat and exterior mirror settings for driving forward
You can retrieve the stored settings either with the memory buttons 
or with the remote control*.

Retrieving settings with memory buttons

If the rotary controls are in the 0 position, the seat heater is switched off. When the 
seat heater is switched on, the numerical marking of the rotary control is illumi-
nated. The control range extends from 1 to 5.

Caution

• You should not kneel on the seats or otherwise apply pressure at specific points 
in order to avoid damaging the heating elements of the seat heaters.
• Do not clean the seats moist ⇒ page 178.
• If you have a subdued pain and/or temperature sensitivity, e.g. through medi-
cation, paralysis or because of chronic illness (e.g. diabetes), we  recommend not 
to use the seat heating. This can lead to burns on the back, the posterior and the 
legs which are difficult to heal. If the seat heating is used, we recommend to make 
regular breaks in your journey when driving long distances, so that in specific cases 
as mentioned above the body can recuperate from the stress of the journey. Please 
consult your doctor, who can evaluate your specific condition.

WARNING

• Greater pedal distances may be needed when there is a fault in the brake 
system.
• Do not place any footmats or other additional floor coverings in the area 
of the pedals in order to ensure that all the pedals can be fully depressed and 
are able to return unobstructed to their initial position - risk of accident!
• There must be no objects on the floor which could roll under the pedals. 
You would then no longer be able to apply the brakes, operate the clutch or 
accelerator - risk of accident!

luggage compartment

Loading the luggage compartment

Please observe the following in the interest of having good handling char-
acteristics of your vehicle:

– Distribute the items of luggage as evenly as possible.

– Place heavy objects as far forward as possible.

– Attach the items of luggage with the safety net* or with tensioning 

straps attached to the lashing eyes ⇒ page 68.

In the event of an accident, there is such a high kinetic energy which is produced by 
small and light objects that they can cause severe injuries. The magnitude of the 
kinetic energy depends on the speed at which the vehicle is travelling and on the 
weight of the object. The speed at which the vehicle is travelling is in this case the 
more significant factor.

Example: In the event of a frontal collision at a speed of 50 km/h, an unsecured 
object with a weight of 4.5 kg produces an energy, which corresponds to 20 times 
its own weight. This means that it results in a weight of approx. 90 kg. You can 
imagine the injuries that can occur, if this “bullet” is flying through the interior 
compartment and hits an occupant.

• Store the objects in the luggage compartment and attach them to the 
lashing eyes.
• Loose objects in the passenger compartment can be thrown forward 
during a sudden manoeuvre or in case of an accident and can injure the 
occupants or other oncoming traffic. This risk is still increased, if the objects 
which are flying around are hit by a deployed airbag. In this case, the objects 
which are thrown back can injure the occupants - hazard!
• Please note that the handling properties of your vehicle may be affected 
when transporting heavy objects as a result of the displacement of the 
centre of gravity. The speed and style of driving must be adjusted accord-
ingly.
• The items carried in the luggage compartment should be stored in such 
a way that no objects are able to slip forward if there are any sudden driving 
or braking manoeuvres undertaken - risk of injury!
• Never drive with the boot lid fully opened or slightly ajar otherwise 
exhaust gases may get into the interior of the vehicle - risk of poisoning!
• On no account exceed the permissible axle loads and the permissible 
gross weight of the vehicle - risk of accident!
• Never transport occupants in the luggage compartment!

Note

• Tyre pressure must be adjusted to the load ⇒ page 200, fig. 183.
• The air circulation in the interior of the car helps to prevent the windows from 
misting up. Stale air is diverted via the outlet nozzles into the lateral trim panels of 
the luggage compartment. Check for yourself that the outlet nozzles are not 
covered.
• On vehicles fitted without foldable backrest but with fixed backrest, the luggage 
compartment cannot be enlarged.

The roof luggage rack system

Description

Pay attention to the following points if you wish to transport luggage or other items 
on the roof of your vehicle:
• Your car has streamlined rain channels integrated into the roof. For this reason, 
it is not possible to use conventional roof racks. We therefore recommend that you 
only use base roof bars from the Škoda Genuine Accessories.
• These base roof bars are the supporting elements for a complete roof bar 
system. Separate additional components are required for safety reasons for trans-
porting luggage, bikes, surfboards, skis and boats. All these components you can 
obtain replacement fuses from a Škoda Service Partner.

Caution

• If you use other roof rack systems or if the roof bars are not properly fitted, then 
any damage which may result to your car is not covered by the warranty agree-

ments. It is therefore essential to pay attention to the fitting instructions supplied 
with the roof luggage rack system.
• On models fitted with a power sliding/tilting roof, ensure that the opened 
sliding/tilting roof does not strike any items of luggage transported on the roof.

You cannot make full use of the permissible roof load if you use a roof luggage rack 
system with a lower load carrying capacity. The load transported on the roof 
luggage rack system must not exceed the weight limit which is stated in the fitting 
instructions.

For the sake of the environment

The increased aerodynamic drag results in a higher fuel consumption. One should 
therefore take off the roof bar system after use.

Attachment points

WARNING

• The items which you transport on the roof bar system must be reliably 
attached - risk of accident!
• You must on no account exceed the permissible roof load, the permis-
sible axle loads and the permissible gross weight of your vehicle - risk of 
accident!
• Please note that the handling properties of your vehicle change when 
you transport heavy or bulky items on the roof bar system as a result of the 
displacement of the centre of gravity and the increased wind attack area - 
risk of accident! You must absolutely adapt your style of driving and the 
speed of the vehicle to the specific circumstances.

Cup holder

Fig. 84  Attachment 
points for roof bars

Fitting
When fitting on the feet of the roof bars, ensure that they are positioned exactly 
between the arrow markings in the sealing strip on the roof ⇒ fig. 84. The markings 
are visible only when the doors are open.

Roof load

Distribute weight evenly over the roof luggage rack system. The maximum permis-
sible roof load (including roof rack system) of 100 kg and the maximum permissible 
total weight of the vehicle should not be exceeded.

Heating and air conditioning system

Air conditioning system

Description
The air conditioning system is a combined cooling and heating 
system. It makes it possible to optimally control the air temperature 
at any season of the year.

Description of the air conditioning system
It is important for your safety and for your driving comfort that the air conditioning 
system is operating properly.

AE

AC

 is 

 ⇒ page 90, fig. 106 

The air conditioning system operates when switch 
pressed and the following conditions are met:
• engine running,
• outside temperature above +5 °C,
• blower switch switched on (positions 1 to 4).
If the cooling system is switched on, the temperature and air humidity drops in the 
vehicle. The wellbeing of the occupants of the car is enhanced as a result of this 
particularly at high outside temperatures and a high air humidity. The system 
prevents the windows misting up during the cold season of the year.

The heating effect is dependent upon the coolant temperature, thus full heat 
output only occurs when the engine has reached its operating temperature.

It is possible to briefly activate recirculated air mode in order to enhance the 
cooling effect ⇒ .

Air at a temperature of about 5°C may flow out of the vents under certain circum-
stances when the cooling system is operating. Lengthy and uneven distribution of 
the air flow out of the vents (in particular at the leg area) and large differences in 
temperature, for example when getting out of the vehicle, can result in chills in 
sensitive persons.

The air inlet in front of the windscreen must be free of ice, snow or leaves in order 
to ensure that the heating and ventilation systems operate properly.

Heating and air conditioning system 89

After switching on the cooling Condensation from the evaporator of the air condi-
tioning may drip down and form a puddle below the vehicle. This is quite normal 
and not an indication of a leak!

Aeration of the vehicle when ignition is switched off*
On models fitted with power sliding/tilting roof with sollar cells, the fresh air blower 
is automatically switched over to “solar mode ” if the sun ray's are sufficient after 
switching off the ignition. The solar cells on the sliding/tilting roof deliver power for 
the fresh air blower. This supplies the interior of the car with fresh air.

For an optimum ventilation, the air outlet vents 3 and 4 must be opened 
⇒ page 92.

The ventilation functions only when the sliding/tilting roof is closed.

WARNING

• For your own safety and that of other road users, ensure that all the 
windows are free of ice, snow and misting. Please familiarize yourself about 
how to correctly operate the heating and ventilation systems, how to demist 
and defrost the windows, as well as with the cooling mode.
• You should not leave recirculated air mode on over a longer period of 
time, as “stale” air may result in fatigue in the driver and occupants, divert 
your attention and also cause the windows to mist up. The risk of having an 
accident increases. Switch recirculated air mode off as soon as the windows 
begin misting up.

Note

We recommend that you do not smoke in the vehicle when the recirculating air 
mode is operating since the smoke which is drawn at the evaporator from the inte-
rior of the vehicle forms deposits in the evaporator of the air conditioning system. 
This produces a permanent odour when the air conditioning system is operating 
which can only be eliminated through considerable effort and expense (replace-
ment of compressor).

• If the cooling system has not been switched on for a lengthy period, odours may 
be produced at the evaporator because of deposits. Switch the air conditioning 
system on at least once a month for approximately 5 minutes at the highest blower

Heating and air conditioning system 93

Using the air conditioning system economically

Climatronic* (automatic air conditioning)

The compressor on the air conditioning system uses power from the engine when 
in cooling mode which will effect the fuel consumption.

Description

It recommended to open the windows or the doors of a vehicle for which the inte-
rior has been strongly heated through the effect of direct sunlight in order to allow 
the heated air to escape.

The cooling system should not be switched on while travelling when the window is 
open.

The desired interior temperature can also be achieved without switching in the 
cooling system just by switching to fresh air mode.

For the sake of the environment

When you economize on fuel, you also reduce pollutant emissions.

Operational problems

If the cooling system does not operate at outside temperatures higher than +5 °C, 
there is a problem in the system. The reasons for this may be:
• The fuse of the air conditioning system is defective ⇒ page 220. Check the fuse, 
replace it if necessary.
• The cooling system has switched off automatically for a short time because the 
coolant temperature of the engine is too hot.

If you are not able to rectify the operational problem yourself, or if the cooling 
capacity decreases, switch the cooling system off. Contact a specialist garage.

The Climatronic system is a combination of an automatic heating, fresh air and 
cooling system which provides optimal comfort for the occupants of the car.

The Climatronic maintains a constant temperature fully automatically, once it has 
been set. This is achieved by automatically varying the temperature of the 
outflowing air, the blower stages and the air distribution. It is not necessary to 
manually alter the settings. The automatic mode ⇒ page 95 ensures maximum 
wellbeing of the occupants at all times of the year.

Description of Climatronic system
The Climatronic can only operate if the following conditions are met:
• engine running,
• outside temperature above +5 °C,
• the 
 button is not pressed.
If the Climatronic system is switched on, the temperature and air humidity drops in 
the vehicle. The wellbeing of the occupants of the car is enhanced as a result of this 
particularly at high outside temperatures and a high air humidity. The system 
prevents the windows misting up during the cold season of the year.

ECON

It is possible to briefly activate recirculated air mode in order to enhance the 
cooling effect ⇒ .

The heating effect is dependent upon the coolant temperature, thus full heat 
output only occurs when the engine has reached its operating temperature.

Puddle of water below car
After switching on the cooling Condensation from the evaporator of the air condi-
tioning may drip down and form a puddle below the vehicle. This is quite normal 
and not an indication of a leak!

A lower tone is heard when switching off this function, when decreasing the blower

Aeration of the vehicle when ignition is switched off*
On models fitted with power sliding/tilting roof with sollar cells, the fresh air blower 
is automatically switched over to “solar mode ” if the sun ray's are sufficient after 
switching off the ignition. The solar cells on the sliding/tilting roof deliver power for 
the fresh air blower. This supplies the interior of the car with fresh air.

For an optimum ventilation, the air outlet vents 3 and 4 must be opened 
⇒ page 97.

The ventilation functions only when the sliding/tilting roof is closed.

WARNING

• For your own safety and that of other road users, ensure that all the 
windows are free of ice, snow and misting. Please familiarize yourself about 
how to correctly operate the heating and ventilation systems, how to demist 
and defrost the windows, as well as with the cooling mode.
• You should not leave recirculated air mode on over a longer period of 
time, as “stale” air may result in fatigue in the driver and occupants, divert 
your attention and also cause the windows to mist up. The risk of having an 
accident increases. Switch recirculated air mode off as soon as the windows 
begin misting up.

Note

• If the cooling system has not been switched on for a lengthy period, odours may 
be produced at the evaporator because of deposits. Switch the air conditioning 
system on at least once a month for approximately 5 minutes at the highest blower 

stage - also during the cold season of the year - in order to remove such odours. 
Also open a window for a short time.
• We recommend that you do not smoke in the vehicle when the recirculating air 
mode is operating since the smoke which is drawn at the evaporator from the inte-
rior of the vehicle forms deposits in the evaporator of the air conditioning system. 
This produces a permanent odour when the air conditioning system is operating 
which can only be eliminated through considerable effort and expense (replace-
ment of compressor).

airbag system will not be able to properly protect you - hazard!
• For safety reasons the lever must always be firmly pushed up to avoid the 
steering wheel altering its position unintentionally when driving - risk of 
accident!
• If you adjust the steering wheel further towards the head, you will reduce 
the protection offered by the driver airbag in the event of an accident. Check 
that the steering wheel is aligned to the chest.
• When driving, hold the steering wheel with both hands firmly on the 
outer edge in the 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock position. Never hold the steering 
wheel firmly in the 12 o'clock position or in another way (e.g. in the middle

General
You can only start the engine only using an original ignition key.
• Place the gearshift lever into neutral (or place the selector lever to the position 
P or N in the case of an automatic gearbox) and put on the handbrake firmly before 
starting the engine.
• The clutch pedal should be fully depressed when starting the engine which 
means that the starter only has to crank the engine.
• Let go of the key as soon as the engine starts otherwise there may be damage 
to the starter.

The engine running noises may louder at first be louder for a short time after 
starting the cold engine until oil pressure can be built up in the hydraulic valve 
clearance compensation. This is quite normal and is not an operating problem.

If the engine does not start ...
You can use the battery of another vehicle as a jump-start aid ⇒ page 215.

It is only possible to tow-start vehicles fitted with a manual gearbox. The tow-
starting distance must not be more than 50 metres ⇒ page 217.

WARNING

• Never run the engine in non ventilated or enclosed areas. The exhaust 
gases of the engine contain besides the odorless and colourless carbon 
monoxide a poisonous gas - hazard! Carbon monoxide can cause uncon-
sciousness and death.
• Never leave your vehicle unattended with the engine running.

Caution

• The starter may only be operated (ignition key position 
running. If the starter is immediately operated after switching off the engine, the 
starter or the engine can be damaged.

• Avoid high engine revolutions, full throttle and high engine loads as long as the 
engine has not yet reached its normal operating temperature - risk of damaging the 
engine!
• Vehicles which are fitted with an exhaust gas catalytic converter should not be 
tow-started over a distance of more than 50 metres.

For the sake of the environment

Never warm up the engine when the vehicle is standing. Drive off right away. 
Through this the engine reaches its operating temperature more rapidly and the 
pollutant emissions are lower.

Petrol engines

These engines are fitted with a starter system which selects the correct fuel/air 
mixture for every external air temperature.
• Do not operate accelerator before and when starting engine.
• Interrupt the attempt at starting after 10 seconds if the engine does not start 
right awayand wait for about 30 seconds before repeating the attempt.
• It is possible that the fuse on the electrical fuel pump is defect if the engine still 
does not start. Check the fuse and replace it if necessary ⇒ page 220.
• If the engine does not start, contact the nearest specialist garage to obtain 
professional assistance.

It may be necessary, if the engine is very hot, to slightly depress the accelerator 
after the engine has started.

Diesel engines

Glow plug system
Diesel engines are equipped with a glow plug system, the preglow period being

Technical Data

Caution

you should not switch the engine off right away at the end of your journey after the 
engine has been operated for a lengthy period at high loads but should be allowed 
it to run at idling speed for about 2 minutes. This prevents any accumulation of heat 
when the engine is switched off.

Note

• The radiator fan may continue running for a further 10 minutes or so after the 
engine and the ignition have been switched off. The coolant fan may, however, also 
switch on again after some time if the coolant temperature rises because of an 
accumulation of heat in the engine or if the engine is warm and the engine 
compartment is additionally heated by strong sunlight.
• This is why particular care is required when carrying out any work in the engine 
compartment ⇒ page 185, “Working in the engine compartment”.

• The glow plug warning light will come on for about one second if the engine is 
at a normal operating temperature or if the outside temperature is above +5°C. This 
means that you can start the engine right away.
• Interrupt the attempt at starting after 10 seconds if the engine does not start 
right awayand wait for about 30 seconds before repeating the attempt.
• It is possible that the fuse on the diesel preglow system is defect if the engine 
still does not start. Check the fuse and replace it if necessary ⇒ page 220.
• If the engine does not start, contact the nearest specialist garage to obtain 
professional assistance.

Starting the engine after fuel tank has run dry
It may take longer than normal to start the engine after refuelling if the fuel tank has 
run completely dry - up to one minute. This is because the fuel system must first of 
all be filled while the attempting to start the engine.

of accident! In addition this can result in premature wear of the rear brake 
pads.
• Never leave children unattended in the vehicle. The children might, for 
example, release the handbrake or take the vehicle out of gear. The vehicle 
might then move off - risk of accident!

Caution

After the car has come to a stop, always first of all apply the handbrake firmly before 
then additionally engaging a gear (manual gearbox) or moving the selector lever 
into position P (automatic gearbox).

WARNING

• The parking aid is not a substitute for the driver paying proper attention 
and it is always the driver's responsibility to take care when parking the 
vehicle or carrying out similar manoeuvres.
• You should therefore satisfy yourself, before reversing, that there is no 
small obstacle, such as a rock, thin post, trailer drawbar etc., behind your 
vehicle. Such an obstacle might not be within the range detected by the 
sensors.

Note

• The parking aid does not operate if you are towing a trailer (applies to models 
which feature a factory-fitted towing device*).
• If a warning signal sounds for about 3 seconds after switching the ignition on 
and engaging reverse gear, and there is no obstacle close to your car, this indicates 
a system fault. Have the fault rectified by a specialist workshop.
• The sensors must be kept clean and free of ice to enable the parking aid to 
operate properly.

Cruise control system (CCS)*

Introduction

The cruise control system (CCS) maintains a constant speed, more than 30 km/h (20 
mph), once it has been set, without you having to depress the accelerator pedal. 
This is only possible within the range which is permitted by the power output and 
braking power of the engine. The cruise control system makes it possible - particu-
larly on long journeys - for you to rest your “accelerator foot”.

• The cruise control system must not, for safety reasons, be used in dense 
traffic or on unfavourable road surfaces (such as icy roads, slippery roads or 
loose chippings) - risk of accident!
• In order to prevent unintentional use of the cruise control system, always 
switch off the system after use.

Note

• Models fitted with a manual gearbox: Always depress the clutch pedal if you 
switch on the cruise control system when the gearbox is in Neutral. Otherwise the 
engine can rev up unintentionally.
• The cruise control system is not able to maintain a constant speed when driving 
on steep downhill sections. The weight of the vehicle increases the speed at which 
it travels. One should shift down in good time to a lower gear or slow the vehicle 
down by applying the foot brake.
• It is not possible on vehicles fitted with an automatic gearbox to switch on the 
cruise control system if the selector lever is in the position P, N, R or 2.

5-speed automatic gearbox

Information for driving with an automatic gearbox
Shifting up and down through the gears is performed automatically.

You can also, however, switch the gearbox over into the Tiptronic mode. 
This mode makes it possible for you to also shift gears manually 
⇒ page 113.

Starting-off and Driving
– Depress the brake pedal and hold it depressed.

– Press the Shiftlock button (button in handle of the selector lever), 

move the selector lever into the desired position, e.g. D ⇒ page 110, 
and then release the Shiftlock button.

– Wait a moment until the gearbox has shifted (a slight engagement 

nudge can be felt).

– Release the brake pedal and depress the accelerator ⇒ .

Stopping for a short time
– The selector lever position N does not have to be selected when stop-
ping just for a short time, such as at a cross roads. It is sufficient to hold 
the vehicle stationary using the foot brake. The engine can, however, 
be allowed just to idle.

Parking
– Depress the brake pedal and hold it depressed.

– Apply the handbrake firmly.

Automatic gearbox*

109

– Press and Shiftlock button in the selector lever, move the selector 

lever to P and then release the Shiftlock button.

The engine can only be started when the selector lever is in position P or N 
⇒ page 101.
It is sufficient to engage selector lever position P when parking on a flat surface. 
When parking on a slope you should first apply the handbrake firmly and then 
move the selector lever into position P. This is to ensure that there is no excessive 
pressure acting on the lock mechanism and that it is easier to subsequently move 
the selector lever out of position P.

If the selector lever position N is selected by accident while driving it is first neces-
sary to release pressure on the accelerator pedal and wait for idling speed of the 
engine to be reached before engaging a drive position in the selector lever.

WARNING

• Do not depress the accelerator when changing the position of the 
selector lever if the car is stationary and the engine is running - risk of acci-
dent!
• Never move the selector lever into position R or P when driving - risk of 
an accident!
• When the engine is running and the vehicle is stationary, it is necessary 
to hold the car with the brake pedal in all the positions of the selector lever 
(except P and N) since the power transmission is never completely inter-
rupted, also not when the engine is idling - the vehicle "creeps".

Selector lever positions

Fig. 122  Selector lever

Fig. 123  Information 
display: Selector lever 
positions

The selector lever position you have engaged is shown in the information display 
of the instrument cluster with the corresponding gear symbol highlighted 
⇒ fig. 123.

P - Parklock
The driven wheels are locked mechanically in this position.
The Parklock must only be engaged when the vehicle is stationary ⇒ .

If you wish to move the selector lever into or out of this position, you must press the 
Shiftlock button in the handle of the selector lever and at the same time depress the 
brake pedal.

R - Reverse
Reverse gear must only be engaged when the vehicle is stationary and the engine 
idling ⇒ .

The brake pedal must be depressed and at the same time the Shiftlock must be 
pressed, if you wish to obtain the selector lever positions R, P or N.

The reversing lights come on when the selector lever is moved into position R when 
the ignition is also on.

N - Neutral
The transmission is in Neutral in this position.

The brake pedal must be depressed (if the lever is in its position for longer than 2 
seconds) in order to move the selector lever out of the positionN into another posi-
tion, with the ignition switched on, on a vehicle travelling at less than 5 km/h or on 
a stationary vehicle.

D - Drive, position for driving forward
When the selector lever is in this position, the forward gears are shifted up and 
down automatically in line with engine load, vehicle speed and the dynamic shift 
programme (DSP).
You must depress the brake pedal ⇒  if you wish to move the selector lever into 
position D from N when the vehicle is travelling at less than 5 km/h or is stationary.

In certain circumstances (e.g. when driving in mountainous regions or when towing 
a trailer) it may be beneficial to select the manual shift programme ⇒ page 113 for 
a short time in order to adapt the gearbox ratios manually to the driving situations.

4 - Position when driving in hilly areas
We recommend this position if driving with the selector lever in position D would, 
in certain circumstances, result in the gearbox frequently shifting between fourth 
and fifth gears.

The gearbox then shifts up and down automatically into the first, second, third and 
fourth gears in line with engine load and vehicle speed. Fifth gear is not engaged in 
this case. This makes it possible to exploit greater engine braking power when the 
accelerator is released ⇒ .

NKO B5 20.book  Page 111  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

Automatic gearbox*

111

The Shiftlock on the selector lever grip must be pressed when moving out of posi-
tion 4 into position D.

3 - Position when driving in mountainous regions
This position of the selector lever is suitable for long sloping sections.

The gearbox shifts up and down automatically into first, second and third gear in 
line with engine load and vehicle speed. The fourth and fifth gears remain locked 
out in order to avoid unnecessary gear changes. Enhanced engine braking power is 
thus available.

The Shiftlock on the selector lever grip must not be pressed when moving out of 
position 3 into position 4.

2 - Position for extreme mountainous sections
This position of selector lever is suitable for very steep downhill sections.

The gearbox shifts up and down automatically into first and second gear in line with 
engine load and vehicle speed. Third, fourth and fifth gears are not engaged. This 
position offers you the maximum possible engine braking power.

The Shiftlock on the selector lever grip must be pressed when moving out of posi-
tion 2 into position 3.

The cruise control system is locked in position 2.

WARNING

• Never move the selector lever into position R or P when driving - risk of 
an accident!
• When the engine is running and the vehicle is stationary, it is necessary 
to hold the car with the brake pedal in all the positions of the selector lever 
(except P and N) since the power transmission is never completely inter-
rupted, also not when the engine is idling - the vehicle "creeps". 
• You must on no account unintentionally operate the throttle (e.g. by 
hand from the engine compartment) if a drive position is engaged when the 
car is stationary. The vehicle would otherwise immediately start off - also 
when the handbrake is firmly applied - risk of an accident!

WARNING (continued)

• You must move the selector lever into position P and firmly apply the 
handbrake first before you or any other person opens the bonnet and starts 
working on the engine when it is running - risk of accident! It is also essential 
to observe all warnings ⇒ page 185, “Working in the engine compartment”.

Note

• Take your foot off the accelerator if you inadvertently shift into N when driving 
and wait until the engine speed has dropped to the idling speed range before 
shifting into D.
• If you shift gear manually it is possible to select positions 4, 3 and 2, but the 
automatic gearbox will not shift down until there is no risk of the engine 
overrevving.

Selector lever lock

Automatic selector lever lock 
With the ignition on, the selector lever is locked when it is in the positions P and N. 
You must depress the brake pedal first and press the Shiftlock button at the same 
time in order to move the selector lever out of these positions. The following will be 
displayed in the information display*:

"Apply foot brake when selecting gear with vehicle stationary"

Symbol  also lights up in the selector lever cover until the brake pedal is actuated.
A time delay element ensures that the selector lever is not blocked when rapidly 
switching over the position N (e.g. from R to D). This does, for example, allow one 
to seesaw out a stuck vehicle. The selector lever lock will click into place if the lever 
is in the N position for more than 2 seconds without the brake pedal being pressed.

The selector lever lock is only active if the vehicle is stationary or moving at speed 
of less than 5 km/h. The lock is switched off automatically into position N when the 
car is travelling at a higher speed.

Technical Data

Adopting a faster style of driving with rapid movements of the accelerator pedal 
combined with sharp acceleration and frequent changes in speed, exploiting the 
top speed of the car or operating the kickdown function, will cause the gearbox to 
switch over to the sporty driving programme. Shifting up later into a higher gear 
makes it possible to fully exploit the power reserves of the engine. The gearbox also 
then shifts down at higher engine speeds than is the case for the economy-oriented 
programmes.

Selecting the most appropriate driving programme for the particular style of driving 
is a continuous process. Irrespective of this it is, however, possible to switch into a 
sporty driving programme by depressing the accelerator rapidly. The gearbox shifts 
down into a lower gear matching the speed of the car and this allows you to accel-
erate rapidly (e.g. when overtaking) without having to depress the accelerator pedal 
fully into the kickdown range. The original programme will be reactivated to match 
your particular style of driving once the gearbox has shifted up again.

When driving in hilly regions, the gears are selected to match uphill and downhill 
sections. This avoids the gearbox frequently shifting up and down when negotiating 
an uphill stretch. Depressing the brake pedal while driving downhill causes the 
gearbox to shift down into the next lower gear. This makes it possible for you to 
exploit the engine braking power without the need for shifting gears manually.

Shiftlock button
The Shiftlock button in the handle of selector lever prevents certain selector lever 
positions being engaged inadvertently. The selector lever lock is cancelled when 
you press the Shiftlock button.

Keylock - Ignition key withdrawal lock
You can only withdraw the ignition key after switching off the ignition if the selector 
lever is in position P. If the ignition key is withdrawn, the selector lever is blocked in 
position P.

Kickdown function
The kickdown function provides you with maximum acceleration 
power.

Depressing the accelerator pedal beyond the pressure point casues the automatic 
gearbox to shift down into a lower gear (in line with vehicle speed and engine 
speed). The gearbox shifts up into the next higher gear when the engine has 
reached its maximum revolutions.

WARNING

Please note that using the kickdown function can result in the driven wheels 
spinning on a smooth or slippery road surface - risk of skidding!

Dynamic shift programme

The automatic gearbox of your vehicle is controlled electronically. Shifting up and 
down through the gears is performed automatically on the basis of pre-defined 
driving programmes.

Adopting a moderate style of driving will cause the gearbox to select the most 
economical driving programme. Shifting up into a higher gear as soon as possible 
and shifting down as late as possible will have a favourable effect on your fuel 
consumption.

It is possible to switch over to manual both when the car is stationary and also when 
driving.

When you accelerate, the gearbox shifts up automatically in gears 1, 2, 3 and 4 into 
the next higher gear just before the maximum permissible engine speed is reached.

If you select a lower gear, the automatic gearbox does not shift down until there is 
no risk of the engine overrevving.

If you operate the kickdown function, the gearbox shifts into a lower gear in line 
with the vehicle speed and engine speed.

Emergency programme
An emergency programme exists in the event of a fault in the system.

The gearbox operates in a corresponding emergency programme if there are func-
tional faults in the gearbox electronics. This is indicated by all of the segments in the 
display lighting up or going out.

It is possible to continue to move the selector lever into all the positions. The 
gearbox always shifts into 4th gear in the positions D, 4, 3 and 2. It is also possible 
to continue to engage reverse gear in the position R.

The manual shift programme (Tiptronic) is switched off in the emergency mode.

If the gearbox has switched over to emergency mode, drive to the nearest 
specialist garage in order to have the fault rectified.

Mobile phones and two-way radio systems

Our specialist garage is also happy to inform you about the possibilities available 
for installing and operating mobile telephones and radio transmitters which have 
an output greater than 10 watts. The Škoda Service Partners can provide you with 
details about the technical possibilities for retrofitting of mobile telephones and 
radio transmitters.

The operation of commercially available mobile phones or two-way radio systems 
may cause operational problems in the electronic systems of your car. The reasons 
for this may be:
• no external aerial,
• external aerial incorrectly installed,
• transmission power greater than 10 watts.
You should therefore not operate a mobile phone or two-way radio system 
inside the vehicle without the use of an external aerial, or with an external aerial 
which has been incorrectly installed.

You should also be aware of the fact that only an external aerial makes it possible 
to achieve the optimal range of such equipment.

WARNING

• If a mobile phone or two-way radio system is operated inside the vehicle 
without using an external aerial, or with an external aerial which has been 
incorrectly installed, the result can be excessive electromagnetic fields 
which may cause harm to your health.
• Please always pay full attention to the traffic situation around you!
• You must not install two-way radio systems, mobile phones or mounts 
on the covers of the airbags or within the immediate deployment range of 
airbags. This might result in injuries to the occupants in the event of an acci-
dent!

The installation of a mobile phone and two-way radio system in a vehicle should 
only be carried out by a Škoda Dealer.

Note

Škoda Auto a.s. permits the operation of mobile phones and two-way radio 
systems with a professionally installed external aerial and a maximum transmission 
power of up to 10 watts.

Please also refer to the operating instructions of the mobile phones and two-way 
radio systems.

Basic information

Driving the safe way
Passive safety measures reduce the risk of injury in accident situa-
tions.

In this section you will find important information, tips and notes on the subject of 
passive safety in your vehicle. We have combined everything here which you 
should be familiar with, for example, regarding seat belts, airbags, child seats and 
safety of children. It is therefore important, in particular, to comply with the notes 
and warnings in this section for your own interest and in the interest of  those trav-
elling with you.

WARNING

• This chapter contains important information on how to use the vehicle 
for the driver and his occupants. You will find further information on safety, 
which concerns you and those travelling with you, in the following chapters 
of this Owner's Manual.
• The complete on-board literature should always be in the vehicle. This 
applies in particular, if you rent out or sell the vehicle.

Safety equipment
The safety equipment is part of the occupant protection and it can 
reduce the risk of injuries in accident situations.

“Do not put at risk” your safety and the safety of those travelling with you . In the 
event of an accident, the safety equipment can reduce the risk of injuries. The 
following list contains part of the safety equipment in your vehicle:

Passive Safety

Before setting off
The driver is always fully responsible for his occupants and for the 
operating safety of the vehicle.

For your own safety and the safety of the people travelling with you, please pay 
attention to the following points before setting off.
• Ensure that the lighting and the turn signal system are functioning properly.
• Inspect the tyre inflation pressure.
• Ensure that all the windows offer a good visibility to the outside.
• Safely attach the items of luggage ⇒ page 67, “Loading the luggage compart-
ment”.
• Ensure that no objects can obstruct the pedal.
• Adjust the mirror, the front seat and the head restraint to match your body size.
• Point out to your occupants that the head restraints must be adjusted to match 
their body size.
• Protect the children in suitable child seats with correctly fastened seat belts 
⇒ page 146, “Transporting children safely”.
• Adopt the correct seated position ⇒ page 127. Also inform your occupants to 
adopt the correct seated position.
• Fasten the seat belt correctly. Also inform your occupants to properly fasten the 
seat belts ⇒ page 132, “How are seat belts correctly fastened?”.

What influences the driving safety?
The driving safety is primarily determined by the style of driving and 
the personal behaviour of all the occupants.

The driver is fully responsible for himself and his occupants. If your driving safety is 
effected, you place yourself and the oncoming traffic at risk. Please refer to the 
following guidelines.
• Do not get distracted from concentrating on the traffic situation, e.g. by your

• Adjust the backrest so that you are able to reach the highest point of the steering 
wheel with your arms at a slight angle.
• Adjust the head restraint so that the top edge of the head restraint is at the same 
level as the upper part of your head ⇒ fig. 136.
• Fasten the seat belt correctly ⇒ page 132, “How are seat belts correctly 
fastened?”.
Manual driver seat adjustment ⇒ page 59, “Adjusting front seats manually”.
Electrical driver seat adjustment ⇒ page 60, “Adjusting seats”.

WARNING

• The front seats and the head restraints must always be adjusted to match 
the body size of the seat occupant as well as the seat belts must always be 
correctly fastened in order to provide an optimal protection for you and your 
occupants.
• The driver must maintain a distance of at least 25 cm to the steering 
wheel ⇒ fig. 135. Not maintaining this minimum distance will mean that the 
airbag system will not be able to properly protect you - hazard!
• When driving, hold the steering wheel with both hands firmly on the 
outer edge in the 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock position. Never hold the steering 
wheel firmly in the 12 o'clock position or in another way (e.g. in the middle 
of the steering wheel or at the inner steering wheel edge). In such cases, 
injuries to the arms, the hands and the head can occur when the driver 
airbag is deployed.
• The backrests must not be angled too far back when driving otherwise 
this will affect proper operation of the seat belts and of the airbag system - 
risk of injury!
• Ensure that there are no objects in the footwell as any objects may get 
behind the pedals during a driving or braking manoeuvre. You would then 
no longer be able to operate the clutch, to brake or accelerate.

Passive Safety

Correct seated position for the front passenger
The front passenger must maintain a distance of at least 25 cm from 
the dash panel so that the airbag offers the greatest possible safety 
when an airbag is deployed.

For the safety of the front passenger and to reduce the risk of injury in the event of 
an accident, we recommend the following setting.
• Adjust the front passenger seat as far as possible to the rear.
• Adjust the head restraint so that the top edge of the head restraint is at the same 
level as the upper part of your head ⇒ page 127, fig. 136.
• Fasten the seat belt correctly ⇒ page 132.
In exceptional cases the front passenger airbag can be deactivated ⇒ page 144, 
“Deactivating an airbag”.
Manual front passenger adjustment ⇒ page 59, “Adjusting front seats manually”.
Electrical front passenger seat adjustment ⇒ page 60, “Adjusting seats”.

WARNING

• The front seats and the head restraints must always be adjusted to match 
the body size of the seat occupant as well as the seat belts must always be 
correctly fastened in order to provide an optimal protection for you and your 
occupants.
• The front passenger must maintain a distance of at least 25 cm to the 
dash panel. Not maintaining this minimum distance will mean that the 
airbag system will not be able to properly protect you - hazard!
• Always keep your feet in the footwell when the car is being driven - never 
place your feet on the instrument panel, out of the window or on the 
surfaces of the seats. You will be exposed to increased risk of injury if it 
becomes necessary to apply the brake or in the event of an accident. If an 
airbag is deployed, you may suffer fatal injuries when adopting an incorrect 
seated position!

WARNING (continued)

• The backrests must not be angled too far back when driving otherwise 
this will affect proper operation of the seat belts and of the airbag system - 
risk of injury!

Correct seated position for the occupants on the rear seats
Occupants on the rear seats must sit upright, keep the feet in the 
footwell and must have their seat belts correctly fastened.

To reduce the risk of injury in the event of a sudden braking manoeuvre or an acci-
dent, the occupants on the rear seats must observe the following.
• Adjust the head restraints so that the top edge of the head restraints are at the 
same level as the upper part of your head ⇒ page 127, fig. 136.
• Fasten the seat belt correctly ⇒ page 132, “How are seat belts correctly 
fastened?”.
• If you are transporting ⇒ page 146, “Transporting children safely” children in 
the vehicle, please use a suitable child restraint system.

WARNING

• The head restraints must always be adjusted to match the body size, in 
order to offer an optimal protection for you and your occupants.
• Always keep your feet in the footwell when the car is being driven - never 
put your feet out of the window or on the surfaces of the seats. You will be 
exposed to increased risk of injury if it becomes necessary to apply the brake 
or in the event of an accident. If an airbag is deployed, you may suffer fatal 
injuries when adopting an incorrect seated position!
• If the occupants on the rear seats are not sitting upright, the risk of injury 
is increased due to incorrect routing of the seat belt.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 129  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

Examples of an incorrect seated position
An incorrect seated position can lead to severe injuries or death for 
the occupants.

Seat belts offer their optimum protection only if the webbing of the seat belts is 
properly routed. Incorrect seated positions considerably reduce the protective 
functions of the seat belts and therefore increase the risk of injury due to an incor-
rect routing of the seat belt. The driver is fully responsible for himself and the occu-
pants, in particular for the children. Do not permit an occupant to adopt an incor-
rect seated position when the car is moving.

The following list contains the examples of seated positions which are dangerous 
for the occupants. This list is not complete, however we would like you to get inter-
ested in this subject.

Passive Safety

129

WARNING

• If the occupant adopts an incorrect seated position, he is exposed to life-
threatening injuries, in case he is hit by a deployed airbag.
• Before setting off, please adopt the correct seated position and do not 
change this seated position while the car is moving. Also advise your occu-
pants to adopt the correct seated position and not to change this seated 
position while the car is moving.

Therefore, while the car is moving never:
• stand up in the vehicle,
• stand up on the seats,
• kneel onto the seats,
• tilt the backrest fully to the back,
• lean against the dash panel,
• lie on the rear seats,
• only sit on the front area of the seat,
• sit to the side,
• lean out of the window,
• put the feet out of the window,
• put the feet on the dash panel,
• put the feet on the seat upholstery,
• occupy the footwell,
• have the seat belt not fastened,
• occupy the luggage compartment.

Seat belts

Seat belts

Why seat belts?

It is important that you pay attention to safety measures, particularly when trans-
porting children in the vehicle ⇒ page 146, “Transporting children safely”.

WARNING

• Fasten your seat belt each time before setting off, also when driving in 
town! This also applies to the people seated at the rear - risk of injury! 
• Expectant women must also always wear a seat belt. This is the only way 
of ensuring optimal protection for the unborn child ⇒ page 132, “Fastening 
three-point seat belts”.
• It is important for the belt webbing to be properly routed if the seat belts 
are to offer the maximum protection. You can see a description of how safety 
belts should be fitted properly on the next pages.

Fig. 137  Driver wearing 
seat belt

Note

Please comply with any differing legal requirements when using the seat belts.

It is a proven fact that seat belts offer good protection in accidents ⇒ fig. 137. Thus 
wearing a seat belt is a legal requirement in most countries.

Seat belts which have been correctly fastened and adjusted hold the occupants of 
the car in the correct seated position ⇒ fig. 137. The belts reduce the kinetic energy 
(energy of motion) to a considerable extent. They also prevent uncontrolled move-
ments which, in turn, may well result in severe injuries.

The occupants of a vehicle who have fastened and correctly adjusted their seat belt, 
profit to a major extent from the fact that the kinetic energy is optimally absorbed 
by the belts. The structure of the front end of the vehicle and other passive safety 
measures, such as the airbag system, also contribute to reducing the kinetic energy. 
The energy produced is thus absorbed and there is less risk of injury.

Accident statistics prove that seat belts which are fastened and properly adjusted 
reduce the risk of an injury and enhance the chance of survival in a major accident 
⇒ page 131.

the greater the amount of energy which has to be absorbed in the event of an acci-
dent.

The speed of the vehicle is, nevertheless, the most important factor. Doubling the 
speed of the vehicle from 25 km/h up to 50 km/h increases the kinetic energy four 
times.

The common opinion that it is possible to support your body in a minor accident 
with your hands, is incorrect. Even in a collision at only a low speed, the forces 
acting on the body are such that it is no longer possible to support your body.

Even if you only drive at a speed within the range from 30 km/h to 50 km/h, the 
forces which are produced on your body in the event of an accident can easily 
exceed 10.000 N (Newton). This equals a weight of one tonne (1 000 kg).

In the event of a frontal collision, occupants of the car not wearing a seat belt, are 
thrown forward and strike in an uncontrolled way parts of the interior of the car, 
such as steering wheel, dash panel, windscreen,⇒ fig. 138. The occupants of a 
vehicle who have not fastened their seat belts may even be thrown out of the 
vehicle. This can result in fatal injuries.

It is also important that rear seat occupants fasten their seat belts as they will other-
wise be thrown through the vehicle in an uncontrolled manner in the event of an 
accident A rear seat passenger who has not fastened the seat belt is a danger not 
only to himself but also for those seated at the front ⇒ fig. 139.

Important safety information regarding the use of 
seat belts
The correct use of the seat belts considerably reduces the risk of 
injury!

The physical principle of a frontal accident can be explained quite simply:

Motion energy, so-called kinetic energy, is produced as soon as the vehicle is 
moving, both for the vehicle and its occupants. The magnitude of this kinetic energy 
depends essentially on the speed at which the vehicle is travelling and on the 
weight of the vehicle and the occupants. The greater the speed and weight increase, 

• The belt webbing must not be jammed in-between at any point or 
twisted, or chafe against any sharp edges.
• It is important that the belt webbing is properly routed if the seat belts 
are to offer their maximum protection ⇒ page 132, “How are seat belts 
correctly fastened?”.

Seat belts

WARNING (continued)

• No two persons (also not children) should ever use a single seat belt 
together.
• The maximum protection which seat belts can offer is only achieved if 
you are correctly seated ⇒ page 127, “Correct seated position”.
• The belt webbing must not run across solid or fragile objects (e.g. spec-
tacles, ball-point pens, keys etc.) as this may be a cause of injuries.
• Bulky, loose clothing (e.g. a winter coat over a jacket) does not allow you 
to be correctly seated and impairs proper operation of the seat belts.
• It is prohibited to use clamps or other objects to adjust seat belts (e.g. for 
shortening the belts for smaller persons).
• The lock tongue should only be inserted into the lock which is the correct 
one for your seat. Wrong use of the safety belt will reduce its capacity to 
protect and the risk of injury increases.
• The backrests of the front seats must not be tilted too far to the rear 
otherwise the seatbelts can lose their effectiveness.
• The belt webbing must always be kept clean. Soiled belt webbing may 
impair proper operation of the inertia reel ⇒ page 179, “Seat belts”.
• The slot of the belt tongue must not be blocked by paper or similar 
objects otherwise the belt tongue will not lock in place properly.
• Inspect the seat belts regularly to ensure they are in good condition. If 
you find seat belts which have damage to the seat belt webbing, seat belt 
connections, to the inertia reels or to the lock, the relevant safety belt must 
be replaced by a specialist garage.
• The seat belts must not be removed or changed in any way. Do not make 
an attempt to repair the seat belts yourself.
• Damaged seat belts which have been subjected to stress in an accident 
and were therefore stretched, must be replaced - this is best done by a 
specialist garage. The anchorage points of the belts must also be inspected. 
The anchorage points for the belts should also be checked. 
• In certain countries it is possible to use seat belts which differ in terms of 
their operation from the seat belts which are described on the pages which 
follow.

How are seat belts correctly fastened?

mother

– Correctly adjust the front seat and the head restraint before fastening 

your seat belt ⇒ page 127, “Correct seated position”. 

NKO B5 20.book  Page 133  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

– Slowly pull the belt webbing at the tongue of the lock over your chest 

and pelvis ⇒ .

– Insert the tongue of the lock into the seat belt buckle belonging to the 

seat until it is heard to lock in place.

– Pull on the belt to check that it has also reliably engaged in the lock.

Each three-point seat belt is equipped with an inertia reel. This inertia reel offers 
you complete freedom of movement if the belt is unreeled slowly. If the brakes are 
applied suddenly, the inertia reel will block. It also blocks the belts when the car 
accelerates, when driving uphill and when cornering.
Expectant mothers must also wear the seat belt ⇒ .

WARNING

• The shoulder part of the seat belt must never run across your neck but 
must run approximately over the middle of the shoulder and fit snugly 
against the chest. The lap part of the belt must run across the hip and must 
never be routed across the stomach. It must always fit snugly ⇒ page 132, 
fig. 140. Adjust the belt webbing as required.
• The lap part of the belt should be positioned as low as possible at the 
pelvis of an expectant mother in order to avoid exerting any pressure on the 
lower abdomen.
• Always ensure that the webbing of the seat belts is properly routed. Seat 
belts which are not correctly adjusted can themselves cause injuries even in 
minor accidents.
• A seat belt which is hanging too loose can result in injuries as your body 
is moved forward by the kinetic energy produced in an accident and is then 
suddenly held firm by the belt.
• Only insert the lock tongue into the lock which is the correct one for your 
seat. This will affect the protection which the belt offers and increase the risk 
of an injury!

Seat belt height adjuster

The seat belt height adjuster makes it possible for you to adapt the 
routing of the three-point seat belt in the area of the shoulder to match 
your body size.

– Move the height adjuster in the desired direction up or down 

⇒ fig. 142.

– Then pull firmly on the belt to ensure that the seat belt height adjuster 

has correctly locked in place.

WARNING

Adjust the height of the belt in such a way that the shoulder part of the belt 
is positioned approximately across the middle of your shoulder - on no 
account across your neck.

Note

It is also possible to adapt the routing of the belt webbing at the front seats by 
adjusting the height of the seat.

Blocking seat belts

The three-point seat belts for the front passenger and for the rear seats can be 
blocked for attaching a child safety seat ⇒ page 152, “Attaching child safety seat”. 
Blocking the belt in this way ensures that the child seat is held firmly in position in 
the car.

WARNING

Never attach a child safety seat on the front passenger seat if the child is 
seated with its back facing in direction of travel when the front passenger 
airbag is still activated ⇒ page 147, “Use of child safety seats on the front 
passenger seat”. Risk of severe or even fatal injuries!

– Press the red button in the belt lock ⇒ fig. 143. The spring force causes 

the tongue of the lock to jump out.

Belt tensioners

– Guide the belt back with your hand to enable the inertia reel to wind 

up the belt webbing more easily.

A plastic knob in the belt webbing holds the belt tongue in a position which is easy 
to get hold of.

Three-point safety belt for the middle rear seat

Your car is equipped as standard with the three-point seat belt in the middle rear 
seat. It is used in the same way as the three-point seat belts on the left and right (at 
front and rear). The three-point seat belt for the rear middle seat must be put on 
first to allow the pelvic part of the belt to run between the belt lock for the right 
three-point seat belt and the backrest, while avoiding crossing the belt webbing of 
the right and middle seat belts.

Safety for the driver and passengers wearing their seat belts, is enhanced by the 
belt tensioners fitted to the inertia reels of the front and rear side three-point seat 
belts, in addition to the protection afforded by the airbag system.

The fastened three-point seat belts are automatically tensioned in the event of a 
frontal collision of a certain severity. The rear outside belt tensioners are also 
deployed if the seat belt is not fastened.

The belt tensioner is deployed in the event of a frontal collision of major severity. A 
powder charge is ignited in the inertia reels during deployment. The belt webbing 
is pulled into the inertia reels by a mechanical system and the belt is tensioned.

Belt tensioners are not activated in the event of minor frontal collisions, side and 
rear-end collisions, in the case of a rollover and also not in accidents in which no 
major forces are produced from the front.

WARNING

The three-point safety belt for the rear middle seat can only fulfil its function 
reliably when the backrests are correctly locked into position ⇒ page 70.

WARNING

• The service life of seat belts and belt tensioners is 15 years from the date 
of manufacture of the vehicle. It is then necessary to have the seat belts 
replaced by a specialist garage.

WARNING (continued)

• Any work on the belt tightener system, including removal and installa-
tion of system components because of other repair work, must only be 
carried out by a specialist garage.
• The protective function of the system is only adequate for a single acci-
dent. If the belt tensioners have been deployed, it is then necessary to 
replace the entire system.
• The Owner's Manual must also be handed over to the new owner if the 
vehicle is sold.

Note

• Smoke is generated when the belt tensioners are deployed. This is not an indi-
cation of a fire in the vehicle.
• It is essential to pay attention to relevant safety regulations if the vehicle or indi-
vidual parts of the system are scrapped. Škoda Service Partners are familiar with 
these regulations and will be able to provide you with detailed information in this 
respect.
• When disposing of vehicle or parts of the system, it is important to comply with 
the national legal requirements.

Airbag system

Airbag system

Description of the airbag system

General information on the airbag system

The front airbag system is complementary to the three-point seat belts and offers 
additional protection for the head and chest area of the driver and passenger in the 
event of a frontal collision.

In the case of a violent side crash, the side and head airbags* reduce the risk of inju-
ries to the occupants on the part of the body facing the side of the accident ⇒ .

The airbag system is only functional after the ignition has been switched on.

The operational readiness of the airbag system is monitored electronically. The 
airbag warning light comes on for a few seconds each time the ignition is switched 
on.

The airbag system (according to vehicle equipment) essentially consists of:
• an electronic control unit,
• the two front airbags,
• the side airbags,
• Head airbags*
• an airbag warning light in the instrument cluster,
• a front passenger airbag switch* ⇒ page 144,
• an indicator light for a switched off front seat passenger airbag* in the middle 
of the dash panel ⇒ page 144.

A fault in the airbag system exists if:
• the airbag indicator light does not light up when the ignition is switched on,
• the warning light does not go out after about 3 seconds after the ignition is 
switched on,
• the airbag indicator light goes out and comes on again after the ignition is 
switched on,
• the airbag indicator light comes on or flickers when driving,

• an airbag indicator light showing a switched-off front passenger airbag* in the 
middle of the dash panel flashes.

WARNING

• To enable the occupants of a car to be protected with the greatest 
possible effect when the airbag is deployed, the front seats must be 
⇒ page 127, “Correct seated position” correctly adjusted to match the body 
size of the occupant.
• If you do not fasten the seat belts when driving, lean too far forward or 
adopt an incorrect seated position, you are exposing yourself to increased 
risk of injury in the event of an accident.
• Have the airbag system checked immediately by a specialist garage if a 
fault exists. Otherwise, there is a risk of the airbag not being activated in the 
event of an accident. 
• No modifications of any kind may be made to parts of the airbag system.
• It is prohibited to manipulate individual parts of the airbag system as this 
might result in the airbag being deployed.
• The protective function of the airbag system is sufficient for only one 
accident. The airbag system must then be replaced if the airbag has been 
deployed.
• The airbag system needs no maintenance during its working life.
• If you sell your car, please hand over the complete vehicle documenta-
tion to the new owener. Please note that the documents relating to the 
possibility of deactivating the front passenger airbag are also part of the 
vehicle documents!
• If the vehicle or individual parts of the airbag system are scrapped, it is 
essential to observe the relevant safety precautions. Škoda Service Partners 
are familiar with these regulations.
• When disposing of vehicle or parts of the airbag system, it is important 
to comply with the national legal requirements.

Airbag system 137

• The dash panel must be replaced after the front passenger airbag has been 
deployed.
• In the event of an accident in which the airbags are deployed:

− The interior lighting comes on (if the switch for the interior light is in the door 
contact position),
− The hazard warning light is switched on,
− All the doors are unlocked.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 137  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

When are the airbags deployed?

The airbag system is designed in such a way that the driver and the front passenger 
airbag are deployed in the event of a frontal collision of major severity.

In the case of a violent side crash, the side airbags on the side of the car at which 
the collision occurs, are deployed together with the head airbag*.

In certain accident situations it is possible that both the front as well as the side 
airbags and the relevant head airbag are deployed at the same time.

The airbags are not deployed in the case of minor frontal and side collisions, in the 
case of rear-end collisions and vehicle rollover.

Deployment factors
It is not possible to state globally which deployment conditions apply to the airbag 
system in every situation as the circumstances which exist in the case of accidents 
vary greatly. An important role in this case, for example, is played by factors such as 
the type of object against which the vehicle impacts (hard, soft), the angle of impact, 
the vehicle speed etc.

A decisive factor for the deployment of the airbags is the deceleration which occurs 
during a collision. The control unit analyses the nature of the collision and activates 
the relevant restraint system. If the vehicle deceleration which occurs and is meas-
ured during the collision remains below the prescribed reference values specified 
in the control unit, the airbags are not deployed although the vehicle may well 
suffer severe damage to the bodywork as a consequence of the accident.

The airbags are not deployed if:
• ignition off,
• a minor frontal collision,
• a minor side collision,
• a rear-end collision,
• rollover.

Note

• A grey white, non harmful gas is released when airbag is inflated. This is 
perfectly normal and is not an indication of a fire in the vehicle.

Airbag system

Front airbag

Description of the front airbags
The airbag system is not a substitute for the seat belt!

The front airbag system, in combination with three-point safety belts, offers addi-
tional protection for the head and chest area of the driver and front passenger in 
the event of a frontal collision of major severity ⇒  in “Important safety informa-
tion regarding the front airbag system” on page 139.

The airbag is not a substitute for the seat belt, but is part of the complete passive 
vehicle safety concept. Please note that an airbag can only offer you optimal 
protection in combination with a seat belt which is fastened.

Apart from their normal protective function, a further task of the seat belts is to 
also hold the driver and front passenger in a correct seated position in the event of 
a frontal collision so as to enable the front airbags to offer the maximum protection.

You should therefore always fasten the seat belts, not only because this is required 
by law, but also for safety reasons and for your own protection ⇒ page 130, “Why 
seat belts?”.

Function of the front airbags
Risk of injury to the head and chest area is reduced by fully inflated 
airbags.

The airbag develops enormous forces when triggered, which can lead to injuries if 
the sitting position or seated position is not correct ⇒  in “Important safety 
information regarding the front airbag system”.

Airbag system 139

Important safety information regarding the front airbag system
Correct use of the airbag system considerably reduces the risk of

Fig. 146  Inflated airbags

The airbag system is designed in such a way that the driver and front passenger 
airbag are deployed in the event of a frontal collision of major severity.

In certain accident situations both the front airbags as well as the head* and side 
airbags may be deployed together.

If the airbags are deployed, the airbags are filled with a propellant gas and inflated 
in front of the driver and front passenger ⇒ fig. 146. The airbags inflate in fractions 
of a second and at a high speed in order to be able to offer that additional protec-
tion in the event of an accident. The forward movement of the driver and of the 
front passenger is cushioned when they make contact with the fully inflated airbag 
and the risk of injury to head and chest is thus reduced.

The specially developed airbag allows the gas to flow out of the inflated airbag in a 
controlled manner (depending on the load of the particular car occupant) in order 
to cushion head and chest areas. The airbag then deflates subsequently to such an 
extent, after an accident, to again provide a clear view forward.

A grey white, non harmful gas is released when airbag is inflated. This is perfectly 
normal and is not an indication of a fire in the vehicle.

Fig. 147  Safe distance to 
steering wheel

WARNING

• Never transport children on the front seat of a vehicle without using a 
proper restraint system. If airbags are deployed in the event of an accident, 
the child might suffer severe or even fatal injuries!
• For the driver and front passenger it is important to maintain a distance 
of at least 25 cm from the steering wheel or dash panel ⇒ fig. 147. Not main-
taining this minimum distance will mean that the airbag system will not be 
able to properly protect you - hazard! The front seats and the head restraints 
must always also be correctly adjusted to match the body size of the occu-
pant.
• It is essential to always switch off ⇒ page 144, “Deactivating an airbag” 
the front passenger airbag when attaching a child safety seat on the front 
passenger seat where the child is seated with its back facing in direction of 
travel (in some countries also when the child is facing the direction of travel).

airbags be deactivated. When transporting a child on the front passenger 
seat, please comply with the appropriate national regulations regarding the 
use of child safety seats.
• There must not by any further persons, animals or objects positioned 
between the front seated occupants and the deployment area of the airbag.
• The steering wheel and the surface of the airbag module in the dash 
panel on the passenger side must not be stuck onto, covered or modified in 
any other way. These parts should only be cleaned with a dry cloth or a cloth 
moistened with water. No objects such as cup holders, mobile phone 
mounts, etc. may be attached to the covers of the airbag modules or be 
located within the immediate area.
• No modifications of any kind may be made to parts of the airbag system. 
Any work on the airbag system including installing and removing system 
components because of other repair work (e.g. removing the steering 
wheel) must only be carried out by a specialist garage.
• Never carry out changes on the front bumper or on the body.
• Never place any objects on the surface of the front passenger airbag in

Side airbag

Description of side airbags
The side airbag together with the head airbag offers enhanced occu-
pant protection in the event of a side collision.

The side airbags are housed in the upholstery of the backrests of the front seats and 
are marked ⇒ fig. 148 with the lettering “AIRBAG” on the middle part.

The side airbag system in combination with the three-point seat belts, offers addi-
tional protection for the upper area of the body (chest, stomach and pelvis) of the 
occupants of the car in the event of a side collision of major severity ⇒  in 
“Important safety information on the side airbag” on page 141.

Apart from their normal protective function, a further task of the seat belts is to 
also hold the driver and front passenger in a correct seated position in the event of

Each time the side airbag is deployed, the head airbag* on the relevant side is auto-
matically deployed at the same time in order to provide the occupant with 
enhanced protection ⇒ page 142.

In the case of a violent side crash the side airbag on the front seat on the side on 
which the collision occurs is deployed ⇒ fig. 149.

In certain accident situations both the front airbags as well as the head and side 
airbags may be deployed together.

If an airbag is deployed, the airbag is filled with propellant gas. The airbags inflate 
in fractions of a second and at a high speed in order to be able to offer that addi-
tional protection in the event of an accident.

A grey white, non harmful gas is released when airbag is inflated. This is perfectly 
normal and is not an indication of a fire in the vehicle.

The load of the occupants is cushioned when plunging into the fully inflated airbag 
and the risk of injury to the entire upper body (chest, stomach and pelvis) is 
reduced on the side facing the door.

WARNING

• It is essential to always switch off ⇒ page 144, “Deactivating an airbag” 
the front passenger airbag when attaching a child safety seat on the front 
passenger seat where the child is seated with its back facing in direction of 
travel (in some countries also when the child is facing the direction of travel). 
If this is not done, there is a risk of the child suffering severe or even fatal 
injuries if the front passenger airbag is deployed. In certain countries 
national legal provisions also require that the side or head passenger 
airbags be deactivated. When transporting a child on the front passenger 
seat, please comply with the appropriate national regulations regarding the 
use of child safety seats.
• Your head should never be positioned in the deployment area of the side 
airbag. You might suffer severe injuries in the event of an accident. This 
applies in particular to children who are transported without using a suit-
able child safety seat ⇒ page 148, “Child safety and side airbag”.
• If children adopt an incorrect seated position when travelling, they may 
be exposed to an increased risk of injury in the event of an accident. This can 
result in serious injuries ⇒ page 146, “What you should know about trans-
porting children!”.
• There must not be any further persons, animals as well as objects posi-
tioned between the occupants and the deployment area of the airbag. There 
must also be no accessories such as cup holders, attached to the doors to 
enable the side airbags to activate properly.
• Only hang light items of clothing on the clothes hooks to the vehicle. 
Never leave any heavy or sharp-edged objects in the pockets of the items of 
clothing.
• Ensure that there are no excessive forces, such as violent knocks, kicks 
etc., impact on the backrests of the seats otherwise the system may be 
damaged. The side airbags would not be deployed in such a case!

WARNING (continued)

• Any seat or protective covers which you fit to the driver or front 
passenger seats must only be of the type expressly authorized by Škoda 
Auto. In view of the fact that the airbag inflates out of the backrest of the 
seat, use of non-approved seat or protective covers would considerably 
impair the protective function of the side airbag.
• Any damage to the original seat covers in the area of the side airbag 
module must be repaired without delay by your specialist garage.
• The airbag modules in the front seats must not display any damage, 
cracks or deep scratches. It is not permissible to use force in order to open 
the modules.
• Any work on the side airbag system including removing and installing 
system components because of other repair work (e.g. removing seats) must 
only be carried out by a specialist garage.

Head airbags*

Description of the head airbags
The head airbag together with the side airbag offers enhanced occu-
pant protection in the event of a side collision.

The head airbags are positioned above the doors on both sides in the interior of the 
car ⇒ fig. 150. The installation positions are each marked with the “AIRBAG” logo.

The head airbag together with the three-point seat belts and the side airbags, offers 
additional protection for the head and neck area of the occupants in the event of a 
side collision of major severity ⇒  in “Important safety information on the head 
airbag” on page 143.

Apart from their normal protective function, a further task of the seat belts is to 
also hold the driver and the occupants in a correct seated position in the event of a 
side collision so as to enable the head airbags to offer the maximum protection.

You should therefore always fasten the seat belts, not only because this is required 
by law, but also for safety reasons and for your own protection ⇒ page 130, “Why 
seat belts?”.

Together with other elements (such as cross bars in the seats, stable vehicle struc-
ture) the head airbags are the consequent further development of occupant 
protection in the case of side collisions.

Function of the head airbags
The risk of injury to the head and neck area is reduced in the event of 
a side collision by fully inflated head airbags.

In the case of a side collision the head airbag is deployed together with the side 
airbag on the side of the car on which the accident occurs ⇒ fig. 151.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 143  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

If the head airbag is deployed, the airbag is filled with propellant gas and extends 
over the entire area of the side window including the door pillars ⇒ fig. 151. 

The protection offered by the head airbags is thus available simultaneously both to 
the front occupants of the car seated on the side on which the accident occurs, as 
well as to the rear occupants. Any impact of the head against parts of the interior or 
objects outside of the car, is cushioned by the inflated head airbag. The reduction 
in any impact to the head and the resultant minimizing of any movements of the 
head additionally reduce the risk of injuries to the neck area. The head airbag also 
offers additional protection in the case of an offset impact by covering the front 
door pillar.

In certain accident situations both the front airbags as well as the side and head 
airbags may be deployed together.

The airbags inflate in fractions of a second and at a high speed in order to be able 
to offer that additional protection in the event of an accident. A grey white, non 
harmful gas is released when airbag is inflated. This is perfectly normal and is not 
an indication of a fire in the vehicle.

If this is not done, there is a risk of the child suffering severe or even fatal 
injuries if the front passenger airbag is deployed. In certain countries 
national legal provisions also require that the side or head passenger 
airbags be deactivated. When transporting a child on the front passenger 
seat, please comply with the appropriate national regulations regarding the 
use of child safety seats.

WARNING (continued)

• There must not be any objects in the deployment area of the head 
airbags which might prevent the airbags from inflating properly.
• Only hang light items of clothing on the clothes hooks to the vehicle. 
Never leave any heavy or sharp-edged objects in the pockets of the items of 
clothing. In addition, it is not permitted to use clothes hangers for hanging 
up items of clothing.
• There must not be any other persons (e.g. children) or animals between 
the car occupant and the deployment area of the head airbag. In addition, 
none of the occupants should lean their head out of the window when 
driving, or extend their arms and hands out of the window.
• The sun visors must not be swivelled to the side windows into the 
deployment area of the head airbags if any objects, such as ball-point pens 
etc. are attached to them. This might result in injuries to the occupants if the 
head airbag is deployed.
• Installing impermissible accessories in the area of the head airbags may 
considerably impair the protection offered by the head airbag in the event of 
it being deployed. When the deployed head airbag is inflated, parts of the 
accessories fitted may in certain circumstances be thrown into the interior 
of the car and cause injuries to the occupants ⇒ page 205, “Accessories, 
changes and replacement of parts”.
• Any work on the head airbag system including installing and removing 
system components because of other repair work (e.g. removing headliner) 
must only be carried out by a specialist garage.

Airbag system

Deactivating an airbag

Deactivating airbags
If any airbags have been deactivated, switch them on again as soon 
as possible so that they are able to again provide their proper protec-
tion.

There is the technical means installed within your vehicle to switch off the front, 
side or head airbag (take out of commission).

This is why you should have the deactivation of the airbags carried out by a 
specialist garage.

On vehicles equipped with the switch for deactivation of the airbags, you can deac-
tivate the front and side passenger airbag by means of this switch ⇒ page 144.

Deactivation of airbags is envisaged only for particular instances, such as if:
• you must in exceptional cases use a child seat on the front passenger seat 
where the child has its back to the direction of travel of the vehicle (in some coun-
tries this must be in the direction of travel due to other legal regulations applying) 
⇒ page 146, “Important safety information regarding the use of child safety seats”
• you are not able to maintain the distance of at least 25 cm between middle of 
steering wheel and chest, despite the driver seat being correctly adjusted,
• special attachments are required in the area of the steering wheel because of a 
physical disability,
• you have installed other seats (e.g. orthopaedic seats without side airbags).
Monitoring the airbag system
The functionality of the airbag system is also monitored electronically, when one 
airbag has been switched off

If the airbag was switched off using diagnostic equipment:
• The warning light for the airbag system lights up for 3 seconds after switching 
on the ignition and then flashes for 12 seconds afterwards in 2 second intervals.

Front passenger airbags switched off using the switch for front passenger 
airbags* in stowage compartment on the front passenger side:

• The airbag warning light comes on in the instrument cluster for about 3 seconds 
each time the ignition is switched on.
• Switching off airbags is indicated in the middle of the dash panel by the lighting 
up of the indicator light   ⇒ fig. 153.

Note

Your Škoda Service Partner will be able to advise you whether national legislation in 
your country allows airbags in your vehicle to be deactivated, and which ones.

Transporting children safely

Transporting children safely

What you should know about transporting children!

WARNING

An introduction to the subject
Accident statistics have revealed that children are generally more 
safely transported on the rear seats than on the front passenger seat.

Always comply with national legal provisions and instructions from the rele-
vant child safety seat manufacturer when installing and using a child seat 
⇒  in “Important safety information regarding the use of child safety 
seats”.

Children younger than 12 years of age should normally travel on the rear seat of the 
vehicle (take note of any national legal provisions which differ from this). They 
should be secured there by means of a child restraint system or by using the existing 
seat belts depending on their age, body size and weight. The child seat should be 
mounted behind the front passenger seat for safety reasons.

The physical principle of an accident does, of course, also apply to children 
⇒ page 131, “The physical principle of a frontal collision”. They differ from adults in 
that their muscles and bone structure of children are not yet fully developed. Thus 
children are exposed to increased risk of injury.

Children should be transported by using special child safety seats in order to 
reduce this risk of injury.  

Use only child safety seats which are officially approved and are suitable for chil-
dren and which comply with the ECE-R 44 Standard, which classifies child safety 
seats into 5 groups ⇒ page 149, “Classification of child seats into groups”. Child 
restraint systems which have been tested for conformity with ECE-R 44 have a non-
detachable test seal (a large E within a circle and below this the test number) 
attached to the seat.

We recommend that you use child safety seats from the Škoda genuine accessories. 
These child seats were developed and also tested for use in Škoda vehicles. They 
fulfil the standard ECE-R 44.

Note

Any national legal provisions which vary from the information contained in this 
Owner's Manual take precedence over the information contained herein.

Important safety information regarding the use of child safety 
seats
Correct use of child safety seats considerably reduces the risk of 
injury!

WARNING

• All the occupants of the car - in particular children - must wear a seat belt 
when the car is moving!
• Children less than 1.50 m in height or younger than 12 years must not use 
a normal seat belt without a child restraint system otherwise this may result 
in injuries to the stomach and neck areas. Comply with the national legal 
requirements.
• One should never carry children, and also not babies! - on one's lap.
• You can transport a child safely in a suitable child safety seat ⇒ page 149, 
“Child seat”!
• Only one child may be fastened with a seat belt into a child safety seat.
• Never leave the child sitting unattended in the seat.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 147  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

WARNING (continued)

• Certain outside climatic conditions can cause life-threatening tempera-
tures in the vehicle.
• Never allow your child to be transported in a vehicle without the use of a 
suitable restraint system.
• Children should also never stand up in a vehicle or kneel on the seats 
when the vehicle is moving. In the event of an accident the child will be 
thrown through the vehicle and may as a result suffer fatal injuries, and also 
injure other occupants.
• Children are exposed to an increased risk of injury in the event of an acci-
dent if they lean forward or adopt an incorrect seated position when the 
vehicle is moving. This particularly applies to children who are transported 
on the front passenger seat if the airbag system deploys in the event of an 
accident. This can result in severe or even fatal injuries.
• It is important that the belt webbing is properly routed if the seat belts 
are to offer their maximum protection ⇒ page 132, “How are seat belts 
correctly fastened?”. Pay particular attention to the information provided by 
the manufacturer of the child safety seat regarding correct routing of the 
belt. Seat belts which are not correctly adjusted can themselves cause inju-
ries even in minor accidents.
• Safety belts must be checked to ensure that they are running properly. 
One should also ensure that the belt is not damaged by sharp-edged fittings.
• It is essential to always switch off ⇒ page 144 the front passenger airbag 
when attaching a child safety seat on the front passenger seat where the 
child is seated with its back facing in direction of travel (in some countries 
also when the child is facing the direction of travel). If this is not done, there 
is a risk of the child suffering severe or even fatal injuries if the front 
passenger airbag is deployed. In certain countries national legal provisions 
also require that the side and head airbags be deactivated. When trans-
porting a child on the front passenger seat, please comply with the appro-
priate national regulations regarding the use of child safety seats.

Use of child safety seats on the front passenger seat
Child safety seats should always be attached to the rear seats.

Fig. 154  Sticker on the 
centre column of the 
body on the front 
passenger side.

We recommend, for safety reasons, that you always mount a child restraint systems 
on the rear seats whenever possible. If you still decide, however, to use a child 
safety seat on the front passenger seat then you must pay attention to the following 
warnings in connection with the use of the airbag system on the front passenger 
seat.

WARNING

• Warning - particular hazard! Never use a child safety seat on the front 
passenger seat in which the child is seated with its back facing the direction 
of travel. This child safety seat is positioned in the deployment area of the 
front passenger airbag. The airbag may cause the child severe, or even fatal 
injuries, in the event of it being deployed.
• This is also clearly stated on the sticker which is located on the centre 
column of the body on the front passenger side ⇒ fig. 154. The sticker is 
visible upon opening the front passenger door. The next warning sticker is 
located on the windscreen near the front passenger seat.

WARNING (continued)

• It is essential to always switch off ⇒ page 144, “Deactivating an airbag” 
the front passenger airbag when attaching a child safety seat on the front 
passenger seat where the child is seated with its back facing in direction of 
travel (in some countries also when the child is facing the direction of travel). 
If this is not done, there is a risk of the child suffering severe or even fatal 
injuries if the front passenger airbag is deployed. In certain countries 
national legal provisions also require that the side or head passenger 
airbags be deactivated. When transporting a child on the front passenger 
seat, please comply with the appropriate national regulations regarding the 
use of child safety seats.
• If the front passenger airbag has been switched off by a specialist garage 
using the vehicle system tester, the side and head passenger airbag* 
remains switched on. In certain countries national legal provisions require 
that besides the front passenger airbag also the side or head passenger 
airbags are deactivated. Please comply with any differing national legal 
regulations regarding the use of child safety seats.
• If a child safety seat in which the child faces in the direction of travel is 
used on the front passenger seat, the front passenger seat must be moved 
back fully. For vehicles with height adjustable front passenger seat, the seat 
must be put in the highest position.
• You should have the front passenger airbag (or airbags) reactivated just 
as soon as you no longer use a child safety seat on the front passenger seat.

Child safety and side airbag
Children must never be seated in the deployment area of the side 
airbags and head airbags.

Fig. 155  Seated position 
of an unprotected child at 
risk from side airbag

Fig. 156  Child properly 
protected by safety seat

In the event of a side collision, the side airbags offer the vehicle occupants 
enhanced protection.

The side airbags are inflated in fractions of a second in order to be able to provide 
this protection ⇒ page 141, “Function of the side airbags”.

An airbag inflating develops such a strong force that an occupant who has not 
adopted a correct seated position may suffer injuries. Also exposed objects which 
are located within the area of the side airbag can cause injuries.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 149  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

This applies particularly to children if they are not transported in accordance 
with legal requirements.

The child is protected when seated in a child safety seat matching its age. Adequate 
room is available between the child and the deployment area of the side airbag and 
head airbag. The airbag offers optimal protection.

Child safety seats which have been tested for conformity with ECE-R 44 have a non-
detachable test seal (a large E within a circle and below this the test number) 
attached to the seat.

Child safety seats are classified in 5 groups:

Attaching child safety seat

Child seat protection
You can block the three-point seat belt in order to attach a child 
safety seat.

You can permanently block the three-point seat belt in order to attach a 
child safety seat. Blocking the belt in this way ensures that the child seat 
is held firmly in position in the car.

Activating child seat protection
– Attach the child safety seat with the three-point seat belt as stated in 

the instructions of the manufacturer of the child seat.

– Now, pull the shoulder part of the belt out fully.

– Insert the tongue of the lock into the seat belt buckle belonging to the 

seat until it is heard to lock in place.

– Reel up the belt webbing until it is fitted snugly against the child seat. 
When the belt is reeled up, this can be detected by a “clicking” noise. 

– Pull on the belt in order to check that it is no longer possible to pull out 

the webbing. The child seat protection is now switched on.

Deactivating child seat protection
– Press the red button on the seat belt buckle. The tongue of the lock 

jumps out of the buckle as a result of the spring force when this is 
done.

– Guide the belt back with your hand to enable the inertia reel to wind 
up the belt webbing more easily. The child safety lock is deactivated 
after the full reeling up of the belt.

Fig. 163  ESP switch

General
The ESP aids you maintain control of your vehicle in situations in borderline driving 
situations such as when negotiating a curve too fast. The risk of skidding is reduced 
and your car thus offers greater driving stability depending on the conditions of the 
road surface. This occurs at all speeds.

The following systems are integrated into the electronic stability programme:
• Electronic Differential Lock (EDL),
• Traction control system (TCS),
• Antilock brake system ABS,
• Brake Assist.

Intelligent Technology

155

Operating principle
The ESP switches on automatically when the engine is started and then conducts a 
self-test. The ESP control unit processes data from the individual systems. It also 
processes additional measurement data which are supplied by highly sensitive 
sensors: the rotational velocity of the vehicle about its vertical axis, the lateral accel-
eration of the vehicle, the braking pressure and the steering angle.

The direction which the driver wishes to take is determined based on the steering 
angle and the speed of the vehicle and is constantly compared with the actual 
behaviour of the vehicle. If differences exist, such as the car beginning to skid, the 
ESP will automatically brake the appropriate wheel.

The car is stabilised again by the forces which take effect when the wheel is braked. 
Intervention into the brake system takes place primarily on the outer front wheel of 
a vehicle which tends to oversteer (tendency for the rear of the vehicle to break 
away) while occurs this is on the inner rear wheel of a vehicle which tends to under-
steer (tendency to shift out of the curve). This braking control cycle is accompanied

The ESP operates in combination with the ABS ⇒ page 159, “Antilock brake system

then you should switch on the ESP again.

Traction control system (TCS)*
The traction control system prevents the driven wheels from spinning 
when accelerating.

WARNING

It is also not possible for the ESP to overcome the physical limits of the 
vehicle. Even if a vehicle fitted with ESP you should still always adapt your 
style of driving to the condition of the road surface and the traffic situation. 
This particularly applies when driving on slippery and wet roads. The 
increased safety offered must not tempt you to take greater risks than other-
wise - risk of an accident!

Note

• All four wheels must be fitted with the same tyres in order to achieve problem-
free operation of the ESP. Differing rolling circumferences of the tyres can lead to an 
undesirable reduction in the engine output.
• Changes to vehicle (e.g. on engine, on the brakes, on chassis or other assign-
ment of tyres and wheels) can influence the function of the ESP ⇒ page 205.

General
The TCS makes it much easier, and sometimes at all possible, to start off, accelerate 
and climb a steep hill when the conditions of the road surface are unfavourable.

Operating principle
The TCS switches on automatically when the engine is started and then conducts a 
self-test. The system monitors the speeds of the driven wheels with the aid of the 
ABS sensors. If the wheels are spinning, the force transmitted to the road surface is 
automatically adapted by reducing the engine speed. This occurs at all speeds.
The TCS operates in combination with the ABS ⇒ page 159, “Antilock brake system 
(ABS)”. The TCS will not function if a fault exists in the ABS system.
The TCS warning light ⇒ page 28 lights up in the instrument cluster when there is a

You can switch the TCS off and on again as you wish by pressing the button 
⇒ fig. 164. The TCS warning light ⇒ page 28 lights up in the instrument cluster 
when the TCS is switched off.

• when driving in deep snow or on a loose surface,
• when it is necessary to rock a car free when it has become stuck.
then you should switch on the TCS again.
The EDL ⇒ page 157, “Electronic Differential Lock (EDL)” is a part of the TCS. THE 
EDL operates independently of the TCS (also when the TCS has been switched off 
using the TCS button).

WARNING

You should always adjust your style of driving to the conditions of the road 
surface and the traffic situation. The increased safety offered must not tempt 
you to take greater risks than otherwise - risk of an accident!

Note

• All four wheels must be fitted with the same tyres in order to achieve problem-
free operation of the TCS. Differing rolling circumferences of the tyres can lead to

• Changes to vehicle (e.g. on engine, on the brakes, on chassis or other assign-
ment of tyres and wheels) can influence the function of the TCS ⇒ page 205, 
“Accessories, changes and replacement of parts”.

Electronic Differential Lock (EDL)
The electronic differential lock prevents an individual wheel from 
slipping.

General
The EDL makes it much easier, and sometimes at all possible, to start off, accelerate 
and climb a steep hill when the conditions of the road surface are unfavourable.

Intelligent Technology

157

Operating principle
The EDL is activated automatically, that is without any action on the part of the 
driver. It monitors the speeds of the driven wheels with the aid of the ABS sensors. 
Should only one drive wheel begin spinning on a slippery surface there will be an 
appreciable difference in the speed of the driven wheels. The EDL function brakes 
the slipping wheel and the differential transmits a greater driving force to the other 
driven wheel. This control process is also accompanied by noises.

Overheating of the brakes
The EDL switches off automatically if unusually severe stresses exist in order to 
avoid excessive heat generation in the disc brake on the wheel which is being 
braked. The vehicle can continue to be driven and has the same characteristics as a 
vehicle not fitted with EDL.

The EDL switches on again automatically as soon as the brake has cooled down.

WARNING

• Depress the accelerator carefully when accelerating on uniformly slip-
pery road surfaces, such as ice and snow. The driven wheels might still spin 
despite the EDL and affect the stability of the vehicle - risk of an accident!
• You should always adapt your style of driving to the condition of road 
surface and to the traffic situation even when your vehicle is fitted with EDL. 
The increased safety offered must not tempt you to take greater risks than 
otherwise - risk of an accident!

Note

• If the ABS warning light comes on, this may also indicate a fault in the EDL. 
Please have the car inspected as soon as possible by a specialist garage.
• Changes to vehicle (e.g. on engine, on the brakes, on chassis or other assign-
ment of tyres and wheels) can influence the function of the EDL ⇒ page 205,

Brakes
What has a negative effect on braking efficiency?

Low brake fluid level
An insufficient level of brake fluid may result in problems in the brake system. The 
level of the brake fluid is monitored electronically ⇒ page 29, “Brake system ”.

Wear-and-tear
Wear-and-tear to the brake pads is greatly dependent on the operating conditions 
of the vehicle and your style of driving. Particularly if you drive a great deal in towns 
and over short distances or if you adopt a sporty style of driving, it may be neces-
sary to have the thickness of the brake pads inspected at a specialist garage 
between the service inspections.

Wet roads or road salt
There may be a certain delay before the brakes take full effect under certain condi-
tions such as when driving through water, during heavy rain showers or after the 
vehicle has been washed in an automatic vehicle wash, since the brake discs and 
brake pads may be moist or even have a coating of ice on them in winter. You 
should dry the brakes as soon as possible (by applying and releasing the brakes 
several times, if the road conditions and the traffic situation allows it).

There also may be a certain delay before the full braking efficiency is available when 
driving on roads which have been treated with road salt if you have not used the 
brakes for some considerable time beforehand. The layer of salt on the brake discs 
and brake pads must first be rubbed off when you apply the brakes.

Corrosion
Corrosion on the brake discs and dirt on the bake pads occur if the vehicle has been 
parked for a long period and if you do not make much use of the braking system.

We recommend cleaning the brake discs by firmly applying the brakes at a fairly 
high speed if you do not make much use of the braking system or if surface corro-
sion is present ⇒ .

Faults in the brake surface
If you notice that the braking distance has suddenly become longer and that the 
brake pedal can be depressed further, it is possible that a brake circuit of the dual-
circuit brake system has failed. Drive, in such cases, to the nearest specialist garage 
without delay in order to have the problem rectified. Drive at a reduced speed while 
on your way to the dealer and adapt your style of driving to the higher brake pedal 
pressure required.

WARNING

• Only apply the brakes for the purpose of drying and cleaning the brake 
discs if the traffic conditions permit this. Do not place any other road users 
in jeopardy.
• When retrospectively mounting a front spoiler, solid wheel hubs etc. one 
must ensure that the air supply to the front wheel brakes is not reduced 
otherwise the braking system could run too hot.
• Allow for the fact that new brake pads do not achieve their full braking 
efficiency until approximately 200 kilometres. New brake pads must be first 
“run in” before they develop their optimal friction force. You can, however, 
compensate for this slightly reduced braking force by increasing the pres-
sure on the brake pedal. This guideline also applies to any new brake pads 
installed at a future date.

Caution

• Never allow the brakes to rub by applying slight pressure if you do not wish to 
brake the vehicle. This causes the brakes to overheat and can also result in a longer 
braking distance and excessive wear.
• Before negotiating a steep downhill section, please reduce your speed, shift 
down into the next lower gear (manual gearbox) or select a lower driving stage 
(automatic gearbox). This enables you to make full use of the braking power of the 
vehicle and reduces the strain on the brakes. Any additional braking should be done 
intermittently, not continuously.

Brake booster

The brake booster boosts the pressure which you generate with the brake pedal. 
The necessary pressure is only generated when the engine is running.

WARNING

WARNING

• Never switch off the engine before the vehicle is stationary.
• The brake booster only operates when the engine is running. Greater 
physical effort for braking is required when engine is switched off. Because 
if you do not stop as normal, this can cause an accident and severe injuries.

Antilock brake system (ABS)
ABS prevents the wheels locking when braking.

General
The ABS contributes significantly to enhancing the active safety of your vehicle. 
Compared to a car not fitted with the ABS brake system, you are able to retain 
optimal steering ability even during a full brake application on a slippery road 
surface because the wheels do not lock up.

You must not expect, however, that the braking distance will be shorter under all 
circumstances as a result of the ABS. The braking distance for example on gravel 
and fresh snow, when you should anyway be driving slowly and cautiously, will be 
longer.

Operating principle
As soon as the vehicle speed has increased to about 6 km/h an automatic test 
procedure is conducted during which you will be able to hear a pumping noise for 
about 1 second.

The brake pressure will be reduced on a wheel which is rotating at a speed which is 
too low for the speed of the vehicle and tending to lock. This control cycle is notice-
able from a pulsating movement of the brake pedal which is accompanied by 
noises. This is consciously intended to provide the driver with the information that 
the wheels are tending to lock (ABS control range). You must always keep the brake 
pedal depressed to enable the ABS to optimally control the brake application in this 
braking range. Never interrupt the application of the brakes!

• The ABS can also not overcome the physical limits of your vehicle. Please 
do not forget this, particularly when driving on icy or wet road surfaces. If the 
ABS is operating within the control range, adapt your speed immediately to 
the conditions of the road surface and the traffic situation. The increased 
safety offered by the ABS must not tempt you to take greater risks than 
otherwise - risk of an accident!
• The normal braking system is still fully functional if there is an ABS fault. 
Visit a specialist garage as quickly as possible and adjust your style of driving 
to take account of the ABS fault in the meantime since you will not know how 
great the damage is.

Note

• A warning light comes on if a fault occurs in the ABS system ⇒ page 29.
• Changes to vehicle (e.g. on engine, on the brakes, on chassis or other assign-
ment of tyres and wheels) can influence the function of the ABS ⇒ page 205, 
“Accessories, changes and replacement of parts”.

Brake Assist*

During a severe brake application (e.g. if a hazard exists), the Brake Assist increases 
the braking force and thus makes it possible to rapidly produce the pressure 
required in the brake system.

The majority of drivers do apply the brakes in good time in dangerous situations, 
but do not depress the brake pedal with sufficient pressure. Consequently, it is not 
possible for the car to achieve its maximum deceleration and the car covers a 
greater distance than necessary.

The Brake Assist is activated by the very quick operation of the brake pedal. In such 
cases, a much greater braking pressure exists than during a normal brake applica-
tion. This makes it possible, even with a relatively low resistance of the brake pedal, 
to produce an adequate pressure in the brake system in the shortest possible time, 
which is required for maximum deceleration of the car. You must apply the brake

pedal firmly and hold it in this position in order to achieve the shortest possible 
braking distance.

The Brake Assist is able to help you achieve a shorter braking distance in emergency 
situations by rapidly producing the pressure required in the brake system. It fully 
exploits the attributes of the ABS. After you release the brake pedal, the function of 
the Brake Assist is automatically switched off and the brakes operate in the normal 
way.

Note

• Have the steering inspected as soon as possible by a specialist garage if there is 
a leak or fault in the system.
• The power steering requires a special hydraulic oil. The oil reservoir is located 
at the front left of the engine compartment ⇒ page 186. The correct hydraulic oil 
level is important for proper operation of the power steering system.

WARNING

• The Brake Assist is also not able to overcome the physical limits of your 
car in terms of the braking distance required.
• Adapt your speed to the conditions of the road surface and to the traffic 
situation.
• The increased safety offered by the Brake Assist must not tempt you to 
take a greater safety risk than otherwise.

Power steering

Power steering assists the driver in steering the vehicle and reduces the physical 
force needed for steering.

The steering characteristics can be changed by a specialist garage.

It is still possible to fully steer the vehicle if the power steering fails or if the engine 
is not running (vehicle being towed in). The only difference is that greater physical 
effort is required.

If the steering is turned to full lock when the car is stationary, you will place great 
stresses on the power steering system. Turning the steering to full lock in such a 
situation will be accompanied by noises. In addition, the idling speed of the engine 
will drop briefly.

Caution

Do not leave the steering at full lock for more than 15 seconds when the engine is 
running - risk of damaging the power steering!

Diesel particle filter* (diesel engine)
In the diesel particle filter the resulting soot particles are collected 
and burnt during the combustion of diesel fuel.

Fig. 165  Vehicle data 
sticker

Code 7GG on the vehicle data sticker ⇒ fig. 165 indicates that your 
vehicle is equipped with a diesel particle filter. The vehicle data sticker is 
located on the floor of the luggage compartment and is also stated in the 
Service schedule.

The diesel particle filter filters the soot particles completely from the exhaust. The 
soot is collected in the diesel particle filter and burnt regularly. To assist this proce-
dure, we recommend not to drive regularly over short distances.

Intelligent Technology

161

NKO B5 20.book  Page 161  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

If the diesel particle filter is clogged or there is a fault, it is indicated by the warning 
light  ⇒ page 25, “Diesel particle filter*  (diesel engine)”.

WARNING

• The diesel particle filter achieves very high temperatures. Therefore do 
not park at points where the hot filter comes into direct contact with dry 
grass or other combustible materials - risk of fire!
• Never use additional underbody protection or corrosion-protection 
agents for the exhaust pipes, catalytic converters, diesel particle filter or 
heat shields. When the engine reaches its operating temperature, these 
substances might ignite - risk of fire.

Note

• When using diesel fuel with high sulphur content the life of the diesel particle 
filter is clearly reduced. A specialist garage will be able to tell you which countries 
use only diesel fuel with high sulphur content.

Driving and the Environment

Driving and the Environment

The first 1 500 kilometres and then afterwards

Caution

A new engine
The engine has to be run in during the first 1 500 kilometres.

All the speed and engine revolution figures apply only when the engine is at its 
normal operating temperature. Never rev up an engine which is cold, neither when 
the vehicle is stationary nor when driving in individual gears.

Up to 1 000 kilometres
– Do not drive faster than 3/4 of the mamimum speed of the gear in use, 

that is 3/4 of the maximum permissible engine speed.

– Do not use full throttle.

– Avoid high engine revolutions.

– Do not tow a trailer.

From 1 000 up to 1 500 kilometres
– Increase the power output of the engine gradually up to the full 

speed of the gear engaged, that is up to the maximum permissible 
engine revolutions.

For the sake of the environment

Not driving at unnecessarily high engine revolutions and shifting to a higher gear as 
early as possible are ways to minimise fuel consumption and operating noise levels 
and protects the environment.

New tyres

New tyres have to be “run in” since they do not offer optimal grip at first. You should 
take account of this fact for the first 500 kilometres and drive particularly carefully.

New brake pads

During the first operating hours the engine has higher internal friction than later 
until all of the moving parts have harmonized. The driving style which you adopt 
during the first 1 500 kilometres plays a decisive part in the success of running in 
your car.

Allow for the fact that new brake pads do not achieve their full braking efficiency 
until approximately 200 kilometres. New brake pads must be first “run in” before 
they develop their optimal friction force. You can, however, compensate for this 
slightly reduced braking force by increasing the pressure on the brake pedal.

You should not drive at unnecessarily high engine revolutions even after the 
running-in period is complete. The maximum permissible engine speed is marked 
by the beginning of the red zone on the scale of the revolutions counter. Shift up 
into the next higher gear on a vehicle fitted with manual gearbox before the red 
zone is reached. Extremely high engine revolutions are automatically governed, by 
the way.

For a vehicle fitted with a manual gearbox the converse situation also applies: Do 
not drive at engine revolutions which are too low. Shift down as soon as the engine 
is no longer running smoothly.

This guideline also applies to any new brake pads installed at a future date.

During the running-in period, you should avoid excessive stresses on the brakes. 
This includes, for example, violent braking, particularly from very high speeds, and 
also when crossing mountain passes.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 163  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

Catalytic converter
Proper operation of the emission control system (catalytic converter) 
is of major significance for driving your vehicle in an environmen-
tally conscious way.

Please refer to the following guidelines:

– For vehicles with petrol engine only refuel with unleaded petrol 

⇒ page 181, “Grades of petrol”.

– Never run the fuel tank completely empty.

– Do not switch off the ignition while you are driving the vehicle.
– Do not pour too much oil into the engine ⇒ page 188, “Replenishing 

engine oil”. 

– Do not tow-start the vehicle over a distance of more than 50 metres 

⇒ page 218, “Tow-starting a vehicle”.

If you drive your vehicle in a country in which unleaded petrol is not available, you 
must have the catalytic converter replaced later when driving the vehicle into a 
country in which use of a catalytic converter is mandatory.

WARNING

• In view of the high temperatures which may be produced in the catalytic 
converter, one should always park a vehicle in such a way that the catalytic 
converter cannot come into contact with easily flammable materials below 
the vehicle - a risk of fire!
• Never use additional underbody protection or corrosion-protection 
agents for the exhaust pipes, catalytic converters or heat shields. Such 
substances might ignite when driving - risk of fire!

Caution

• Vehicles fitted with catalytic converter should never be allowed to let the fuel 
tank to run completely empty. An irregular fuel supply can result in poor ignition or 

Driving and the Environment

163

misfiring. Unburnt fuel may get into the exhaust system and damage the catalytic 
converter.
• Filling the tank even only once with leaded petrol will result in the catalytic 
converter being destroyed.
• If you detect misfiring, a drop in performance or irregular engine running when 
driving, reduce your speed immediately and have the vehicle inspected by the 
nearest specialist garage. The symptoms described may be caused by a fault in the 
ignition system. Unburnt fuel may get into the exhaust system and damage the 
catalytic converter.

For the sake of the environment

Even if the exhaust system is operating properly, a sulphur-like exhaust odour may 
be produced under certain operating conditions of the engine. This depends on the 
sulphur content of the fuel. It is often sufficient to refuel with unleaded premium-
grade petrol of a different brand or at a different filling station.

Driving in an economical and environmentally 
conscious manner

General
Your personal style of driving is a major factor.

Your fuel consumption, any pollution of the environmental and the wear-and-tear 
to the engine, brakes and tyres, depend essentially on three factors:
• your personal style of driving,
• the conditions under which your vehicle is operated,
• technical aspects.
You can easily improve your fuel economy by 10 - 15 percent by driving in an 
economical way with foresight. This section is intended to provide you with a 
number of tips on how to protect the environment and at the same time save 
money.

Driving and the Environment

The fuel consumption can naturally also be influenced by factors which are beyond 
the driver's control. It is, for example, normal for the fuel consumption to increase 
in winter and under worsened conditions such as poor road conditions, towing a 
trailer, etc.

The technical requirements for low fuel usage and economic efficiency of the 
vehicle have already been built into the vehicle at the works. Special attention has 
been given to minimising negative effects on the environment. It is necessary to 
take note of the guidelines given in this chapter in order to make best use of these 
characteristics and to maintain their effectiveness.

Looking ahead when driving
A vehicle's highest fuel consumption occurs it accelerates.

Avoid accelerating and braking unnecessarily. If you drive with forsight you will not 
need to brake so often and will also then not have to accelerate so much. Let your 
vehicle coast to a stop, for example, if this is possible, when you see that the next 
set of traffic lights is at red.

Shifting gears and saving energy
Shifting up early saves on fuel.

Manual gearbox
– Drive no more than about one length of your vehicle in first gear. 

Always shift up into the next higher gear at approx. 2 000 to 2 500 revs.

Automatic gearbox
– Depress the accelerator pedal slowly. Do not depress it beyond the 

kickdown position, however.

An effective way of achieving good fuel economy is to shift up early. You will 
consume more fuel if you drive at unnecessarily high revolutions in any given gear.
The ⇒ fig. 166 shows the ratio of fuel consumption to the speed of your vehicle in 
the relevant gears. Fuel consumption in 1st gear is the highest, while that in 5th or 
the 6th gear is the lowest.

Only depress the accelerator pedal slowly if your vehicle is fitted with an automatic 
gearbox in order to automatically select an economic driving programme. You will 
achieve good fuel economy by shifting up early and shifting down late. This applies 
in particular if you make use of the manual mode (Tiptronic) for shifting gears.

Note

Also use the information supplied by the multi-functional indicator ⇒ page 15.

tion in litres/100 km. and 
speed in km/h.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 165  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

Avoiding full throttle
Driving more slowly means saving fuel.

Fig. 167  Fuel consump-
tion in litres/100 km. and 
speed in km/h.

Sensitive use of the accelerator will not only significantly reduce fuel consumption 
but also positively influence environmental pollution and wear of your vehicle.

You should avoid fully exploiting the top speed of your vehicle wherever possible. 
Fuel consumption, pollutant emissions and vehicle noises increase disproportion-
ally at high speeds.
The ⇒ fig. 167 shows the ratio of fuel consumption to the speed of your vehicle. 
You will cut your fuel consumption by half if you only make use three-quarters of 
the possible top speed of your vehicle.

Reducing idling
Idling also costs fuel.

It is worthwhile switching off the engine in a traffic jam or when waiting at a level 
crossing or at traffic lights with a lengthy red phase. Even after just 30 - 40 seconds 
you will have saved more fuel than that is needed when you start the engine up 
again.

If an engine is only idling it takes much longer for it to reach its normal operating 
temperature. Wear-and-tear and pollutant emissions, though, are particularly high 

Driving and the Environment

165

in the warming-up phase. This is why you should drive off right after starting the 
engine. Do avoid high engine revolutions at this time, however.

Regular servicing
A poorly tuned engine consumes an unnecessarily high amount of 
fuel.

Having your vehicle serviced regularly at a specialist garge enables you to satisfy 
one of the requirements for economical motoring even before you set off on your 
journey. Keeping your vehicle properly serviced not only has a positive effect on the 
safety of your vehicle and maintaining its value, but also saves on fuel.

A poorly tuned engine can result in a fuel consumption which is 10% higher than 
normal.

The foreseen maintenance work should be undertaken exactly according to the 
Service schedule by a specialist garage.

Also check the oil level after refueling. Oil consumption is dependent to a consid-
erable extent on the load and speed of the engine. Oil consumption could be as 
high as 0.5 litres/1 000 km depending on your style of driving.

It is quite normal that a new engine has a higher oil consumption at first, and 
reaches its lowest level only after a certain running in time. It is therefore not 
possible to correctly assess the oil consumption of a new vehicle until after you 
have driven about 5 000 km.

For the sake of the environment

• You can achieve additional improvements in your fuel economy by using high-
lubricity oils.
• Check the ground below your car at regular intervals to detect any leakages in 
good time. Please have your vehicle inspected by a specialist garge if you find any 
stains caused by oil or other fluids on the floor.

Driving and the Environment

Avoid driving short distances
Short distances result in an above-average high fuel consumption.

Fig. 168  Fuel consump-
tion in litres/100 km at 
different temperatures

– Avoid driving a distance of no more than 4 km if the engine is cold.

The engine and catalytic converter must first have reached their optimal operating 
temperature in order to effectively reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emis-
sions.

The cold engine vehicle consumes approx. 20 - 30 litres/100 km of fuel immediately 
after starting. Fuel consumption drops to 15 litres/100 km after just 1 kilometre. The 
engine reaches its operating temperature (outside temperature and engine 
dependent) only after about 4 to 10 kilometres and the fuel consumption then 
stabilizes. You should therefore avoid driving short distances whenever possible.

An important factor in this connection is also the ambient temperature. The 
⇒ fig. 168 shows the different fuel consumptions for the same distance, on the one 
hand at +20°C and on the other hand at -10°C. Your vehicle has a higher fuel 
consumption in winter than in summer.

Checking tyre inflation pressures
Tyres which are correctly inflated save fuel.

Always ensure that your tyres are inflated to the correct pressure at all times. The 
rolling resistance will be increased if the tyre filling pressure is too low. This will not 

only increase fuel consumption but also tyre wear and the driving behaviour will 
worsen.

Always check the inflation pressure of the tyres when cold.

Do not drive with winter tyres all year round for this costs about 10 % more fuel. 
Winter tyres are also louder.

No unnecessary ballast
Transporting ballast costs fuel.

The fact that every kilogram of extra weight increases your fuel consumption 
means that it is worth taking a look in the luggage compartment to avoid trans-
porting any unnecessary ballast.

It is particularly in town traffic, when one is accelerating quite often, that the vehicle 
weight will have a significant effect upon the fuel consumption. A rule of thumb 
here is that an increase in weight of 100 kilograms will cause an increase in fuel 
consumption of about 1 litre/100 kilometres.

You may frequently also leave a roof rack fitted on just out of convenience, 
although you no longer need it. The increased aerodynamic drag of your vehicle 
causes it to use about 1 l more fuel than normal at a speed of 100 - 120 km/h, even 
when you are not carrying a load on the roof.

Saving electricity
Generating electricity costs fuel.

– Switch off electrical components as soon as you no longer need them.

When the engine is running, the alternator generates and supplies electrical power. 
The greater the load on the alternator as a result of having a large number of elec-
trical components switched on, the more fuel will be consumed for operating the 
alternator.

Keeping a log of your fuel consumption

If you really wish to keep a close check on your fuel consumption, it is best to enter 
the figures in a logbook. This does not take much time but is a very worthwhile exer-
cise. It enables you to detect any change (positive and negative) at an early stage 
and to take any appropriate action.

If you find that your fuel consumption is too high, you should reflect on how, where 
and in what conditions you have driven the vehicle since you last refuelled.

Environmental compatibility

Environmental protection has played a major role in the design, selection of mate-
rials and manufacture of your new Škoda. Particular emphasis has been paid to a 
number of aspects, including:

Design measures
• Joints designed to be easily detached
• simplified disassembly due to the modular structure system
• improved purity of different classes of materials
• Identification of all plastic parts in accordance with VDA Recommendation 260
• Reduced fuel consumption and exhaust emission CO2
• Minimum fuel leakage during accidents
• Reduced noise
Choice of materials
• extensive use of recyclable material
• Air conditioning filled with CFC-free refrigerant
• no cadmium
• no asbestos
• Reduction in the “vaporisation” of plastics
Manufacture
• solvent-free cavity protection

• solvent-free protection of the vehicle for transportation from the production 
plant to the customer
• The use of solvent-free adhesives
• No CFCs used in the production process
• without use of mercury
• Use of water-soluble paints
Trade-in and recycling of old cars
Škoda Auto meets the requirements of the brand and its products regarding envi-
ronment and ressource protection. All new Škoda vehicles can be utilized up to 
95 % and always 3) be returned. In a lot of countries sufficient trade-in networks 
have been created, where you can trade-in your vehicle. After you trade-in your 
vehicle, you will receive a confirmation stating the recycling in accordance with 
environmental regulations.

Vehicles with special built-on types
Technical documents regarding changes carried out on the vehicle must be kept by 
the vehicle user, in order to hand over later to the old car user. This ensures the 
recycling in accordance with environmental regulations.

Motoring abroad

General
Other circumstances may exist abroad.

It is also possible, in certain countries, that the Škoda Service Partner network is 
limited or has not been established yet. This is the reason why obtaining certain 
spare parts may be somewhat complicated and specialist garage personnel may 
only be able to make limited repairs. Škoda Auto a.s. in the Czech Republic and rele-
vant importers are happy to provide information about technical aspects of the 
vehicle, required maintenance work and possibilities for getting repairs done.

Driving and the Environment

Unleaded petrol

A vehicle fitted with a petrol engine must always be refuelled with unleaded petrol 
⇒ page 163. The automobile associations can provide you with information 
regarding the locations of filling stations which offer unleaded petrol.

Headlight

The low beam of your headlights is set asymmetrically. It illuminates the side of the 
road on which you are driving to a greater extent. If you drive abroad on the other 
side of the road, you will dazzle oncoming traffic.

It is necessary in order to avoid dazzling oncoming traffic to stick a sticker over a 
certain part of the headlights.

Headlight stickers can be obtained as a spare part from the Skoda Service Partners.

Headlights with Xenon lamps are designed for driving in countries with traffic on 
the right or on the left. Have this done always at a Škoda Service Partner.

Note

You can obtain further information regarding masking over or converting the head-
lights from your Škoda Service Partner.

Avoiding damage to your vehicle

When driving on poor roads and lanes or when driving over kerbstones, steep 
ramps etc., you must pay particular attention to ensuring that any low-slung parts 
of the vehicle, such as spoiler and exhaust, do not touch the ground and get 
damaged.

This particularly applies to models with a lowered suspension (sport suspension) 
and also when your vehicle is fully laden.

Towing a trailer

Towing a trailer

Technical requirements
The towing device must satisfy certain technical requirements.

Your vehicle is designed primarily for transporting persons and luggage. It can, 
however, also be used for towing a trailer - provided certain technical equipment is 
fitted.

If your vehicle has already been supplied with a factory-fitted towing device then 
everything that is necessary for towing a trailer in technical terms, and in terms of 
the law, has already been taken into account.

Your vehicle is fitted with a 13-pin power socket for the electrical connection 
between the vehicle and trailer. If the trailer which you wish to tow has a 7-pin 
connector, you can use a suitable adapter 4) from Škoda original accessories.
This work must be carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications 
if a towing device is retrofitted.

Škoda Service Partners are familiar with details relating to retrofitting a towing 
device and for any necessary modifications to the cooling system.

WARNING

We recommend that you have the towing device from Škoda original acces-
sories installed by a Škoda Service Partner. He is familiar with all the relevant 
details relating to retrofitting such equipment. There is a risk of an accident 
if the towing device is not properly fitted!

Towing a trailer

169

General Maintenance
There are a number of points to pay attention to when towing a 
trailer.

Trailer load
The permissible trailer load must on no account be exceeded.

You can negotiate appropriately steeper inclines and descents if you do not make 
full use of the permissible trailer load.

The trailer loads specified only apply for altitudes up to 1 000 metres above mean 
sea level. The fact that the engine power output drops with increasing height due to 
a lowering of air pressure and thus the ability to climb, means that the towed weight 
must be reduced by 10% for every further increase of 1 000 metres in height above 
sea level. The towed weight is the weight of the (laden) vehicle and the (laden) 
trailer together. One should take this into account before driving up to higher alti-
tudes.

The trailer and drawbar load information on the type plate of the towing 
device are merely test data for the towing device The data relating to your 
vehicle, which is often less than this test data, can be found in your vehicle 
registration documents.

Distribution of the load
Distribute the load in the trailer in such a way that any heavy items are located as 
close as possible to the axle. Secure the items to prevent them slipping.

Tyre pressure
Select the tyre inflation pressure on your vehicle for that of “fully laden”, 
⇒ page 200. The inflation pressure of the tyres fitted to the trailer adjust in accord-
ance with the manufacturer's recommendation.

Exterior mirrors
You have to have additional exterior mirrors fitted if you are not able to see the 
traffic behind the trailer with the standard rear-view mirrors. Both exterior mirrors

should be attached to folding arms. Adjust the mirrors so that they provide you with 
an adequate field of view to the rear.

Headlights
Before starting off with a hitched trailer, also check the setting of the headlights. 
Alter the setting as necessary with the aid of the headlight beam adjuster 
⇒ page 48.

Detachable ball head
The ball rod is detachable on vehicles which feature a factory-fitted towing device. 
It is stowed together with separate fitting instructions in the spare wheel well in the 
luggage compartment of the vehicle.
Further information on the towing device ⇒ page 171.

Note

• We recommend that you also have your vehicle inspected between service 
intervals if you tow a trailer frequently.
• The handbrake on the towing vehicle must be put on when coupling and 
decoupling the trailer.

Driving Tips
Particular caution is required when towing a trailer.

– Do not, as far as possible, drive with your vehicle unladen and the 

trailer laden.

– Do not make full use of the legal maximum speeds. This applies in 

particular to downhill sections.

– Apply the brakes in good time.

– Keep a check on the coolant temperature gauge if the outside temper-

ature is high.

Distribution of weight
The distribution of the weight is very poor if your vehicle is unladen and the trailer 
is laden. Maintain a particularly low speed if you cannot avoid driving with this 
combination.

Driving speed
Do not drive faster than 80 km/h for safety reasons. This also applies for countries 
in which higher speeds are allowed.

The fact that the driving stability of the vehicle + trailer combination reduces with 
increasing speed means that the legally allowed speed should not be used when 
there are unfavourable road, weather or wind conditions, particularly near accident 
black spots.

You must always reduce your speed immediately as soon as you detect even just 
the slightest swaying of the trailer. On no account attempt to stop the trailer from 
“swaying” by accelerating.

Apply the brakes in good time! If the trailer is fitted with a trailer brake, apply the 
brakes gently at first and then brake firmly. This will avoid brake jolts resulting from 
the trailer wheels locking. Shift down gears in good time before negotiating a down-
hill section to allow the engine to also act as a brake.

Engine overheating
Please keep a check on the coolant temperature gauge if you have to negotiate a 
lengthy slope in a low gear at a high engine speed when the outside temperature is 
very high ⇒ page 12. 

If the needle of the coolant temperature gauge moves into the right-hand area or 
even the red area of the scale, reduce your speed immediately. Stop and switch off 
the engine if the warning light  in the instrument cluster begins flashing. Wait a 
few minutes and check the level of coolant in the coolant expansion bottle 
⇒ page 190, “Inspecting the coolant level”.
Please refer to the following guidelines ⇒ page 26, “Coolant temperature, Coolant 
quantity ”.
The coolant temperature can be reduced by switching on the heating.

Any increase in the cooling effect of the coolant fan through shifting down a gear 
and increasing the engine speed is not possible since the fan speed is independent 

NKO B5 20.book  Page 171  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

of the engine speed. One should also not drop a gear for this reason when towing 
a trailer as long as the engine can manage the slope without any drop in speed.

Note

• Do not carry out any modifications or repairs to the ball head or to any other 
components on the towing device.
• Contact a specialist garage if you encounter any problems using the device.
• Never unlock the ball head with a trailer coupled to it.
• You should take off the ball head if you drive without towing a trailer. Inspect 
whether the end cover properly seals off the mounting shaft.
• Remove the ball head beforehand if you wish to clean your vehicle using a 
steam jet. Ensure that the end cover properly seals the mounting shaft.
• It is recommended to wear gloves when installing and removing.

Fig. 169  Detachable ball 
head

The detachable ball head of the towing device is stowed in the spare wheel well in 
the luggage compartment. 

An instruction for correct installation and removal of the ball head of the towing 
device is supplied with the ball head

Inspect the ball head to ensure that it is properly locked each time before setting off. 
The inspection is performed by turning the closed locking lever downwards. If the 
locking lever can only be turned around a small angle (approx. 5°), the locking 
mechanism is O.K. After the inspection pull the locking lever back again to its stop. 
The towing device must not be used, if it does not wish to close or the locking lever 
turns slightly in the closed position.

WARNING

Do not use any aids or tools for installing or removing the ball head. This 
might result in damage to the locking mechanism to the extent that the 
safety of the towing device is no longer assured - risk of an accident.

General Maintenance

Taking care of your vehicle and cleaning the vehicle

General
Proper care retains the value of your vehicle.

Regular and proper care retains the value of your vehicle. It may also be one of the 
requirements for the acceptance of warranty claims relating to corrosion damage 
and paint defects on the bodywork.

We recommend using a preservative from Škoda genuine accessories offered by 
your Škoda dealer. Please follow the instructions for use on the package.

WARNING

• Care products may be harmful to your health if not used according to the 
instructions.
• Always store care products in a safe place, out of the reach of children - 
risk of poisoning!

For the sake of the environment

• Always select environmentally-friendly products when purchasing vehicle care 
products.
• Do not dispose of residues of care products in domestic waste.

Care of the exterior of vehicle

Washing the vehicle
Frequent washing protects your vehicle.

The best protection for your vehicle against harmful environmental influences is 
frequent washing and wax treatment. How often you should wash your vehicle 
depends on a wide range of factors, such as:
• Frequency of use,
• The parking situation (garage, below trees etc.),
• Season of the year,
• Weather conditions,
• Environmental influences.
The longer insect residues, bird droppings, tree sap, road and industrial dust, tar, 
soot particles, road salt and other aggressive deposits remain adhering to the paint-
work of your vehicle, the more detrimental their destructive effect can be. High 
temperatures, such as those caused by intensive sun's rays, accentuate this caustic 
effect.

It may therefore be necessary, in certain circumstances, to wash the car once a 
week. It may also be sufficient, however, to wash the car once a month followed 
by appropriate wax treatment.

It is essential to also thoroughly wash the underside of your vehicle at the end of 
the winter road salting and gritting period.

WARNING

When washing your vehicle in the winter: Water and ice in the brake system 
can affect the braking efficiency - risk of accident!

Taking care of your vehicle and cleaning the vehicle

Automatic vehicle wash systems

Rinse off the vehicle well after giving it a wash and dry it off using a chamois leather.

The paintwork of the vehicle is sufficiently resistant that the vehicle can be washed 
normally in automatic vehicle wash plants without any problem. The actual stress 
to which the paintwork is subjected, however, depends greatly on the design of the 
vehicle wash system, the filtering of the water and the type of washing and care 
products used. If the paintwork of your vehicle appears mat after being washed or 
even has scratches, point this out to the operator of the vehicle wash plant. Use a 
different vehicle wash plant, if necessary.

There are no particular points to note before washing your vehicle in such a plant 
other than the usual precautionary measures (closing windows and sliding/tilting 
roof, moving any factory-fitted aerials down flat against the bodywork, etc.).

If you have any particular attached parts fitted to your car - such as spoiler, roof rack 
system, two-way radio aerial - it is best to first of all consult the operator of the car 
wash plant.

It is important to degrease the lips of the windscreen wiper rubbers after passing 
through the automatic vehicle wash system.

Caution

Do not screw the swivelling down roof aerial tight before washing the vehicle in an 
automatic vehicle wash system - risk of damage!

Washing vehicle by hand

It is important to first soften the dirt with plenty of water and rinse it off as thor-
oughly as possible before washing your vehicle by hand.

One should then clean the vehicle using a soft washing sponge, washing glove or 
a washing brush and only slight pressure. Work from the top to the bottom - 
beginning with the roof. Only place slight pressure on the vehicle paintwork during 
cleaning Only use a car shampoo for stubborn dirt.

Wash out the sponge or washing glove thoroughly at short intervals.

Clean wheels, door sills and similar parts last. Use a second sponge for such areas.

WARNING

• The ignition should always be switched off when you wash your vehicle - 
risk of accident!
• Protect your hands and arms from sharp-edged metal parts when you 
are cleaning the underfloor, the inside of the wheel housings or the wheel 
trims - risk of cuts.

Caution

• Do not wash your vehicle in bright sunlight - risk of paint damage.
• Ensure that the jet of water is not aimed directly at the locks or at the door and 
panel joints if you spray your vehicle in winter down with a hose - risk of freezing.
• Do not use any insect sponges, rough kitchen sponges or similar cleaning prod-
ucts - risk of damage to the surface of paintwork.

For the sake of the environment

Only wash your vehicle at washing bays specifically reserved for this purpose. This 
ensures that no water which may be contaminated by oil flows into the sewage 
system. It is not even permitted to wash your vehicle in certain areas except at such 
specific washing bays.

Washing with a high-pressure cleaner

When you wash your vehicle with a high-pressure cleaner, it is essential to comply 
with the instructions for use of the cleaning equipment. This applies in particular to 
the pressure used and to the spraying distance. Maintain a sufficiently large 
distance to soft materials such as rubber hoses or insulation material.

On no account use circular spray nozzles or so-called dirt cutters!

Taking care of your vehicle and cleaning the vehicle

175

WARNING

It is particularly important that you do not clean tyres with circular spray 
jets. Visible but also invisible damage to tyres may occur even at a relatively 
large spraying distance and if sprayed only for a short time - risk of accident!

Caution

• You must not treat mat painted parts or plastic with polishing products or hard 
wax.
• Do not polish the paintwork of the vehicle in a dusty environment, otherwise 
the paintwork can be scratched.

Caution

The water containing wax must be no hotter than 60°C, otherwise the vehicle can 
be damaged.

Chrome parts

Wax treatment

First clean the chrome parts with a damp clotch and then polish them with a soft, 
dry cloth. If it does not prove to be adequate, use a chrome care product from 
Škoda original accessories.

Good wax treatment is an effective way of protecting the paintwork from harmful 
environmental influences and minor mechanical damage.

Caution

The vehicle must be treated with a high-quality hard wax polish at the latest, when 
no more drops form on the clean paintwork.

A new layer of a high-quality hard wax polish can be applied to the clean bodywork 
after it has dried thoroughly. Even if you use a wax preserver regularly we still 
recommend that you treat the paintwork of the vehicle at least twice a year with 
hard wax.

Caution

Never apply wax to the windows.

Polishing

Polishing is only necessary if the paintwork of your vehicle has become unattractive 
and if it is no longer possible to achieve a gloss with wax preservers.

You must treat the paintwork with a wax preserver if the polish you use does not 
contain any preserving elements ⇒ page 175, “Wax treatment”.

We recommend using a preservative from Škoda genuine accessories offered by 
your Škoda dealer.

Do not polish the chrome parts in a dusty environment, otherwise they can be 
scratched.

Paint damage

Slight damage to paintwork such as scratches, scuffs or traces of chip damage must 
be touched up immediately with paint (Škoda painting pen) before any corrosion 
can result. You can of course have this work carried out by a Škoda Service Partner.

Škoda Service Partners have a range of matching touch-up pens or spray cans 
available in the colour of your vehicle.

The paint number of the original paintwork of your vehicle is indicated on the 
vehicle data sticker ⇒ page 227.

Any corrosion which has already have formed must be removed thoroughly. Apply 
a corrosion protection primer and then the paint to the affected point. You can of 
course have this work carried out by a Škoda Service Partner.

Taking care of your vehicle and cleaning the vehicle

Plastic parts

The headlight lenses

External plastic parts are cleaned by normal washing. Plastic parts and synthetic 
leather can also be treated with special solvent-free plastic cleaning agents if a 
damp cloth is not sufficient. Paint care products are not suitable for plastic parts.

Please do not use any aggressive cleaning or chemical solvent products - risk of 
damage to the plastic lenses Please use soap and clean warm water.

Caution

Solvent-free cleaners attack the material and can damage it.

Windows

Only use a plastic ice scraper for removing snow and ice from the windows and 
mirrors. You should not move the ice scraper forward and backward but in one 
direction on the window which you are cleaning in order to avoid any damage to 
the surface of the glass. 

You can best remove residues of rubber, oil, grease, wax or silicone by using a 
special window cleaner or a special silicone remover.

You should also clean the windows regularly from the inside.

Do not use window leathers which you have used to polish the vehicle body to dry 
off the windows. Residues of preservatives in the window leather can dirty the 
window and reduce visibility.

Do not affix any stickers over the inside of the rear window to avoid damage to the 
heating elements of the rear window heater.

We recommend using a preservative from Škoda genuine accessories offered by 
your Škoda dealer.

Caution

Never remove snow or ice from the glass parts with warm or hot water - risk of 
formation of cracks in the glass!

Caution

Never wipe the headlights dry and do not use any sharp objects for cleaning the 
plastic lenses, this may result in damage to the protective paintwork and conse-
quently in formation of cracks on the headlight lenses, e.g through effect of chem-
ical products.

Door and window seals

The rubber seals on the doors, boot lid, bonnet and windows remain supple and 
last longer if you treat them from time to time with a rubber care product (e.g. with 
a spray with silicone-free oil). You also avoid premature wear of the seals and 
prevent leakages in this way. It is also easier to open the doors. Rubber seals which 
are well cared for also do not stick together in cold winter weather.

Locks

We recommend that you use the spray from Škoda original accessories with 
regreasing and anticorrosive effect for de-icing locks.

Note

When washing your vehicle, ensure that as little water as possible gets into the 
locks.

Wheels

Underbody protection

Steel wheels
You should also thoroughly wash the wheels and wheel trims when giving your 
vehicle its regular wash. This prevents any brake dust, dirt and road salt from 
sticking to the wheel hubs. You can remove stubborn brake abrasion adhering to 
the wheels with an industrial cleaner. Touch up any damage to the paintwork on the 
wheels before rust is able to form.

Light alloy wheels
Regular care of light alloy wheels is necessary in order to retain their decorative 
appearance over long periods. It is particularly important to remove any road salt 
and brake abrasion from light alloy wheels every two weeks, otherwise the surface 
will suffer. Wash thoroughly and then treat the wheels with a protective product for 
light alloy wheels which does not contain any acidic components. You should 
provide the wheel hubs with a hard wax layer every three months. You must not use 
any products which cause abrasion when treating the wheel hubs. Any damage to 
the paint layer on the wheel hubs must be touched up immediately.

We recommend using a preservative from Škoda genuine accessories offered by 
your Škoda dealer.

WARNING

One should remember when cleaning the wheels that moisture, ice and road 
salt may adversely affect braking efficiency - risk of an accident!

Note

Severe layers of dirt on the wheels can also result in wheel imbalance. This may 
show itself in the form of wheel vibration which is transmitted to the steering wheel 
which, in certain circumstances, can cause premature wear of the steering. It is 
therefore important to clean dirty wheels.

The underside of your vehicle is protected for life against chemical and mechanical 
influences.

One cannot, however, completely rule out damage to the protective layer when 
driving so we recommend that you inspect the protective layer on the underside of 
your vehicle and on the chassis at certain intervals - this is best done at the begin-
ning and end of the winter - and to touch up any damaged areas.

Škoda Service Partners have suitable spray products available as well as the neces-
sary equipment and are familiar with the instructions for use. It is therefore best to 
have such touch-up work or additional corrosion protection measures carried out 
by a Škoda Service Partner.

WARNING

Never use additional underbody protection or corrosion-protection agents 
for the exhaust pipes, catalytic converters, diesel particle filter or heat 
shields. When the engine reaches its operating temperature, these 
substances might ignite - risk of fire!

Protection of hollow spaces

All the cavities of your vehicle which are at risk from corrosion are protected for life 
by a layer of protective wax applied in the factory.

This wax protection does not require to be inspected or re-treated. Please remove 
any small amount of wax which flows out of the cavities at high temperatures with 
a plastic scraper and clean the spot using petroleum cleaner.

WARNING

Safety and environmental protection regulations should observed when 
using petroleum cleaner to remove wax - a risk of fire!

Taking care of your vehicle and cleaning the vehicle

Engine compartment

Good corrosion protection is very important, particularly in winter when one often 
drives over its salt-strewn roads. One should therefore clean the entire engine 
compartment before and after the salt spreading period, in order to prevent the salt 
from being destructive.

Škoda Service Partners have the cleaning agents recommended by the manufac-
turer and also the required equipment.

WARNING

• It is necessary to observe the guidelines given in the chapter before 
working on the engine compartment ⇒ page 185.
• Let the engine cool down before cleaning the engine compartment.

Caution

• Engine cleaning may be only be undertaken when the ignition is off.
• It is recommended to cover the generator before washing the engine compart-
ment.

For the sake of the environment

The dirty water produced by washing the engine has washed away petrol, and resi-
dues of grease and oil and should therefore be cleaned by an oil separator. This is 
why engine washing should only be undertaken in a garage or at a fueling station 
(when these are fitted with the required equipment).

Care of the interior of vehicle

Plastic parts, artificial leather and cloths

Upholstery cloth and cloth trim on the doors, luggage compartment cover, head-
liner etc. are best treated with special cleaning products, using if necessary a dry 
foam and a soft sponge or brush.

We recommend using a cleaning product from Škoda genuine accessories offered 
by your Škoda dealer.

Caution

Solvent-free cleaners attack the material and can damage it.

Fabric covers of electrically heated seats

Do not clean the seat covers moist as this may result in damage to the seat heating 
system.

Clean such covers using special agents, for example dry foam.

Natural leather
Natural leather requires quite particular care and attention.

Leather should be treated from time to time according the following 
guidelines depending on how much it is used.

Normal cleaning
– Clean soiled areas of the leather with slightly moistened cotton or 

woollen cloth.

Severe soiling
– Clean severely soiled areas with a cloth dipped in a mild soapy solu-

tion (2 spoonfuls of natural soap to 1 litre of water).

– Ensure that the leather is not soaked through at any point and that no

water gets into the stitching of the seams.

– Dry off the leather with a soft, dry cloth.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 179  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

Removing stains
– Remove fresh stains which are water-based (e.g. coffee, tea, juices, 

blood etc.) with an absorbent cloth or household paper or use the 
cleaner from the care set for a stain which has already dried in.

– Remove fresh stains on a fat base (e.g. butter, mayonnaise, chocolate 
etc.) with an absorbent cloth or household cleaning paper or with the 
cleaner from the care set if the stain has not yet penetrated into the 
surface.

– Use a grease dissolver for grease stains which have dried in.

– Eliminate special stains (e.g. ball-point pens, felt pen, nail varnish, 
dispersion paint, shoe cream etc.) with a special stain remover suit-
able for leather.

Leather care
– Treat the leather every six months with the leather care product avail-

able from Škoda Service Partners.

– Apply only a small amount of the care product.

– Dry the leather off with a soft cloth

It is best to consult your Škoda Service Partner if you have any questions regarding 
cleaning and care of the leather interior.

Caution

• You must on no account treat the leather with solvents (e.g. gasoline, turpen-
tine), floor wax, shoe cream or such like.
• Avoid leaving your vehicle for lengthy periods in bright sunlight in order to 
avoid bleaching the leather. If you leave your vehicle parked in the open for lengthy 
periods, protect the leather from the direct rays of the sun by covering it over.
• Sharp-edged objects on items of clothing such as zip fasteners, rivets, sharp-
edged belts may leave permanent scratches or signs of rubbing on the surface.

Taking care of your vehicle and cleaning the vehicle

179

Note

• Use a care cream with light blocker and impregnation effect regularly and each 
time after cleaning the leather. The cream nourishes the leather, allows it to breathe 
and keeps it supple and also provides moisture. It also creates surface protection.
• Clean the leather every 2 to 3 months, remove fresh soiling each time this 
occurs.
• Remove fresh stains such as those from ball-point pens, ink, lipstick, shoe 
cream etc., as quickly as possible.
• Care also for the leather dye. Refreshen areas which have lost their colour with 
a special coloured leather cream as required.

Alcantara upholstery

Do not use any leather care products for cleaning Alcantara upholsteries.

Eliminating dust and dirt
Wipe the Alcantara upholstery with a slightly moistened, soft cloth or clean the 
covers with a suitable shampoo.

Removing stains
Moisten a soft cloth with lukewarm water or diluted methylated spirits and dab the 
stain from the edges toward the middle.

Caution

• Do not use any leather care product on the Alcantara upholsteries.
• Avoid leaving your vehicle for lengthy periods in bright sunlight in order to 
avoid bleaching the Alcantara upholsteries. If you leave your vehicle parked in the 
open for lengthy periods, protect the Alcantara upholstery from the direct rays of 
the sun by covering it over.

Taking care of your vehicle and cleaning the vehicle

– Wash seat belts which have become soiled using a mild soapy solu-

tion.

– Inspect the seat belts regularly to ensure they are in good condition.

Belt webbing which has become severely soiled may prevent the inertia reel from 
reeling up the belt properly.

WARNING

• The seat belts must not be removed for cleaning.
• Never clean the seat belts chemically as dry cleaning may destroy the 
fabric. The seat belts must also not be allowed to come into contact with 
corrosive liquids (such as acids etc.).
• Seat belts which have damage to the webbing, the connections, the 
inertia reel or the lock should be replaced by a Škoda Service Partner.
• Inertia reel belts must be completely dried before being reeled up.

Fuel

Petrol

Grades of petrol

There are various grades of petrol. Please read ⇒ page 227 in order to know which 
grade of petrol your vehicle requires. You will also find the same information affixed 
to the inside of the fuel filler flap of your vehicle ⇒ page 182, fig. 170.

A distinction is made between unleaded and leaded petrol. All Škoda vehicles with 
petrol engines are equipped with a catalytic converter and must therefore be only 
driven with unleaded petrol. Unleaded petrol complies with the standard 
DIN EN 228. 

The individual grades of petrol are distinguished by their octane number (RON). 
Please adopt the following procedure if the grade of petrol which you normally use 
is not be available in exceptional circumstances:
• Engines which need unleaded premium petrol 95 RON can also be run on 
unleaded regular petrol 91 RON. This does, however, result in a slight loss in 
performance.
• Engines which need unleaded premium plus petrol 98 RON can also be run 
on unleaded regular petrol 95 RON. This does, however, result in a slight loss in 
performance. You can in exceptional circumstances also use unleaded regular 
petrol of 91 RON in the event that neither unleaded premium petrol of 98 RON nor 
95 RON is available. Refuel as soon as possible with unleaded premium plus of 98 
RON or unleaded premium petrol of 95 RON.

If, in an emergency, the only fuel available is one which has a lower octane number 
than that required by the engine then only drive at medium engine speeds and 
lower engine loadings.

You can make unlimited use of fuel which has a higher octane number than that 
required by the engine. There will, however, be no advantages gained by this in 
terms of engine performance and fuel consumption!

Fuel

181

The handling, performance and life of your engine are determined to a significant 
extent by the quality of the fuel. Do not use any petrol additives. Use a fuel 
complying with the standard.
You can find further information on refuelling ⇒ page 182, “Refuelling”.

Caution

• Filling the tank even only once with leaded petrol will result in the catalytic 
converter being destroyed.
• Operating the engine with petrol of a low octane number can result in engine 
damage at high revolutions or severe engine loading.

Diesel

Type of diesel

Your vehicle can be operated with diesel fuel, which complies with the standard 
DIN EN 590.

Fuel additives
You must not use fuel additives, so-called “flow improvers” (petrol and similar 
products) in diesel fuel.

If the quality of the diesel fuel is poor, it is then necessary to drain the fuel filter 
more often than stated in the Service schedule.
You can find information on refuelling ⇒ page 182, “Refuelling”.

Caution

• Use a fuel complying with the standard. Filling the tank even only once, which 
does not comply with the standard, can result in damage to the fuel system.
• Water which has collected in the fuel filter can result in engine problems.

Fuel

Operation in winter

Winter-grade diesel fuel
A different grade of diesel fuel is available at filling stations in winter than during the 
summer. Using “summer-grade diesel fuel” at temperatures below 0°C can result in 
operational problems because the diesel becomes viscous as a result of paraffin 
separation.

It is therefore the case that DIN EN 590 prescribes diesel fuel class for certain 
periods of the year which can also be purchased at the corresponding time during 
the year. “Winter-grade diesel fuel” will still operate properly even at a temperature 
of -20°C.

It is often the case in countries with different climatic conditions that diesel fuels 
available have a different temperature characteristic. Škoda Service Partners and 
filling stations in the country concerned will be able to provide you with informa-
tion regarding the diesel fuels available.

Prewarming fuel
The vehicle is fitted with a fuel filter prewarming system. This secures operation of 
a vehicle using diesel fuel down to an environmental temperature of -25°C.

Caution

It is not permitted to add the various fuel additives on the market, including petrol, 
to diesel fuel in order to improve its flow properties.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 183  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

WARNING

Pay attention to any legal requirements if you do carry a spare canister in the 
vehicle. We do not recommend carrying any fuel canisters in your vehicle for 
safety reasons. The canister can be damaged in the event of an accident and 
fuel may leak out.

Caution

• Remove any fuel which has spilled onto the paintwork of your vehicle immedi-
ately - risk of paint damage!
• Vehicles fitted with catalytic converter should never be allowed to let the fuel 
tank to run completely empty. An irregular supply of fuel to the engine can result in 
misfiring and unburnt fuel may get into the exhaust system, which may result in 
overheating and damage to the catalytic converter.
• Make sure that the valve is not pressed into the filler tube when inserting the 
pump nozzle into the filler tube. Otherwise you are unintentionally filling up the 
volume, which in case of heat can cause an expansion of the fuel. This can lead to 
an overflow of fuel or damage to parts of the fuel reservoir.
• The fuel tank is full just as soon as the pump nozzle switches off for the first time, 
provided the nozzle has been operated properly. Do not continue refuelling - 
otherwise the expansion volume is filled up.

WARNING

• Never open the bonnet if you see that steam or coolant is flowing out of 
the engine compartment - risk of scalding! Wait long enough until the steam 
or coolant has stopped escaping.
• For safety reasons, the bonnet must always be properly closed when 
driving. One should therefore check that the lock has in fact engaged prop-
erly after closing the bonnet.
• Stop your vehicle immediately while driving if you notice that the lock is 
not properly engaged and close the bonnet properly - risk of an accident!

Caution

• Before opening the bonnet, ensure that the arms of the windscreen wipers are 
correctly in place against the windscreen. Otherwise, there is a risk of damage to the 
paintwork.

Working in the engine compartment
Particular care is required when carrying out any work in the engine 
compartment!

There is a risk of injuries, scalding, accidents and fire when working in the 
engine compartment, e.g. inspecting and replenishing oil and other fluids. For 
this reason, it is essential to comply with the warning instructions stated 
below and with the general applicable rules of safety. The engine compart-
ment of your car is a hazardous area ⇒ .

WARNING

• Never open the bonnet if you see that steam or coolant is flowing out of 
the engine compartment - risk of scalding! Wait long enough until the steam 
or coolant has stopped escaping.
• Switch off the engine and pull out the ignition key.
• Apply the handbrake firmly.

WARNING (continued)

• If your vehicle is fitted with a manual gearbox, move the gearshift lever 
into Neutral, or if it is fitted with automatic gearbox, move the selector lever 
into position P.
• Allow the engine to cool down.
• Keep children clear of the engine compartment.
• Do not touch any hot engine parts - risk of burns!
• Never spill oil and other fluids over the hot engine. Such fluids (e.g. the 
antifreeze contained in the coolant) may ignite!
• Avoid short circuits in the electrical system - particularly on the battery.
• Never place your hand into the radiator fan as long as the engine is still 
warm. The fan might suddenly start running!
• Never open the cap of the coolant expansion bottle as long as the engine 
is still warm. The cooling system is pressurized!
• Cover over the cap of the coolant expansion reservoir with a large cloth 
when opening it as protection for your face, hands and arms from hot steam 
or hot coolant.
• Do not let objects, such as e.g cleaning cloth or tools lie in the engine 
compartment.
• If you wish to work under the vehicle, you must secure the vehicle from 
rolling away and support it with suitable supporting blocks: the car jack is 
not sufficient for this - risk of injury!
• In cases where it be necessary to carry out inspection work when the 
engine is running there is an additional risk from rotating parts (e.g. the V-
ribbed belt, alternator, radiator fan) and from the high-voltage ignition 
system. Please observe in addition the following:

− Never touch the electrical cables of the ignition system.
− Absolutely avoid any jewellery, loose items of clothing or long hair 
from getting into the rotating parts of the engine - Hazard! Therefore 
remove any jewellery beforehand, tie up your hair and wear tight fitting 
clothing.

Engine oil specifications
The grade of engine oil should be selected in accordance with 
precise specifications.

The engine of your vehicle has been factory-filled with a high-grade oil which you 
can use throughout the year - except in extreme climatic regions.

You can mix various oils together with each other when refilling with oil. This does 
not, however, apply for models with flexible service intervals (QG1).

Engine oils are, of course, undergoing continuous further development. Thus the 
information stated in this Owner's Manual is only correct at the time of publication.

Škoda Service Partners are informed by Škoda Auto a.s. about current changes. This 
why you should always have engine oil changed by your Škoda Service Partner.

The specifications (VW standards) stated in the following must be indicated sepa-
rately or together with other specifications on the bottle.

Caution

Only the above-mentioned oils may be used on vehicles with flexible service inter-
vals (QG1). We recommend always refilling with oil of the same specification since 
this will maintain the properties of the oil. In exceptional cases, you must top up 
only once engine oil complying with Specification VW 502 00 (only for petrol 
engines) or Specification VW 505 01 (only for diesel engines) to maximum 0.5 litres. 
You must not use other engine oils - risk of engine damage!

Note

• Before a long drive we recommend that you purchase and carry with you 
engine oil which complies with the specification for your vehicle. Consequently, 
you will always have the correct engine oil for refilling.
• We recommend using a preservative from the Škoda original accessories 
offered by your Škoda dealer.
• For further information - see Service shedule.

Changing engine oil

Cooling system

The engine oil must be changed at the intervals stated in the Service schedule or 
according to the service interval indicator ⇒ page 14.

Coolant
The job of the coolant is to cool the engine.

WARNING

• Only carry out the engine oil change, if you have the required profes-
sional knowledge!
• Read and observe the warning notes ⇒ page 185, “Working in the engine 
compartment” before working in the engine compartment.
• Let the engine cool down - risk of burning from hot oil.
• Wear an eye protection - risk of caustic burns due to oil splashes.
• Oil is toxic! Store old oil in a safe place out of the reach of children and 
unauthorized persons until you dispose of it properly.

Caution

You must not pour any additives into the engine oil - risk of engine damage! 
Damage, which results from such product, are excluded from the warranty.

For the sake of the environment

• You must on no account pour oil into the ground or into the sewage system.
• In view of the problems involved in properly disposing of old oil, the material, 
equipment and the knowledge required for such work, we recommend that you 
have the oil and oil filter change carried out by your Škoda Service Partner.

Note

After your skin has come in contact with the oil, you must thoroughly wash your 
skin.

The cooling system does not require any maintenance under normal operating 
conditions. The coolant consists of water with a concentration of coolant additive 
of 40 %. This mixture not only provides antifreeze protection down to -25°C but 
also protects the cooling and heating system from corrosion. It also prevents the 
formation of scale and significantly increases the boiling point of the coolant.

You must therefore not reduce the concentration of antifreeze agent in the coolant 
by adding water, also not during the summer months or in countries with a warm 
climate. The concentration of coolant additive in the coolant must be at least 
40%.

You can increase the amount of antifreeze in the coolant if a higher concentration 
of antifreeze is necessary for climatic reasons but only up to 60% (antifreeze 
protection down to approx. -40°C). The antifreeze protection tails off above that 
concentration.

Vehicles exported to countries with a cold climate (e.g. Sweden, Norway, Finland) 
are already factory-filled with a coolant which offers antifreeze protection down to 
about -35°C. In these countries the concentration of coolant additive should be at 
least 50 %.

Coolant
The cooling system is filled at the works with coolant (purple in colour), which 
complies with the specification TL-VW 774 F.

We recommend that you use the antifreeze agent - G12 PLUS (purple in colour).

Please contact your Škoda Service Partner if you have any questions regarding the 
coolant or if you wish to fill up with a different coolant.

Your Škoda Service Partner can also supply you with the correct coolant additives.

Inspecting and Replenishing

Caution

• Other coolant additives may cause operational problems which, in partic-
ular, involves significantly reducing the anticorrosion effect.
• Any faults or problems resulting from corrosion may cause a loss of 
coolant and, as a consequence of this, result in major engine damage.

Inspecting the coolant level

Fig. 176  Engine 
compartment: Coolant 
expansion bottle

B1Z-0042H
B1Z-0042H

The coolant expansion bottle is located in the engine compartment on 
the left.

– Switch the engine off.
– Open the bonnet ⇒  in “Working in the engine compartment” on 

page 185.

– Check the level of coolant in the coolant expansion bottle ⇒ fig. 176. 
The coolant level when the engine is cold must lie between the “MIN” 
and “MAX” markings. The level may also rise slightly above the “MAX” 
marking when the engine is warm.

If the coolant level in the reservoir is too low, this is indicated by the warning light 
in the instrument cluster  ⇒ page 22. We nevertheless recommend inspecting 
the coolant level directly at the reservoir from time to time.

Loss of coolant
A loss of coolant is first and foremost an indication of a leak in the system. You 
should not merely top up the coolant in the reservoir. It is also important to have 
the cooling system inspected without delay by a specialist garage.

Losses can only occur through the pressure relief in the cap of the coolant expan-
sion bottle which is completely free of leaks if the coolant boils as a result of over-
heating and is forced out of the cooling system.

WARNING

Read and observe the warning notes ⇒ page 185, “Working in the engine 
compartment” before working in the engine compartment.

Caution

One should contact a specialist garage as soon as possible if the source of over-
heating itself cannot be determined and removed, since there may be grave 
damage to the engine.

Replenishing the coolant

– Switch the engine off.

– Allow the engine to cool down.

– Place a cloth over the cap of the coolant expansion reservoir 

⇒ fig. 176 and unscrew the cap carefully by turning it to the left 
⇒ .

– Top up the coolant.

– Screw the cap tight until it is heard to lock.

The coolant which you use for replenishing the system, must comply with one 
specific specification ⇒ page 189, “Coolant”. Do not use an alternative additive if 
the coolant additive G12 PLUS is not available in exceptional cases. Just top up the 

NKO B5 20.book  Page 191  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

system with water and as soon as possible arrange adjustment to correct the mixing 
ratio of water and coolant additive again by a specialist garage.

Only use fresh coolant for topping up the system.

Do not fill up over the “MAX” marking! Excess coolant which is heated up is forced 
out of the cooling system through the pressure relief valve in the cap of the coolant 
compensation bottle.

Wait until the engine has cooled down for a system which has suffered a major loss 
of coolant before pouring in coolant. This is necessary to avoid engine damage.

WARNING

• The cooling system is pressurized! Do not open the cap of the coolant 
expansion bottle if the engine is still hot - risk of scalding!
• The coolant additive and thus all of the coolant is harmful to your health. 
Avoid contact with the coolant. Coolant vapours are also harmful to the 
health. It is important, therefore, to always safely store any coolant additive 
in its original container out of the reach of children - risk of poisoning!
• If any splashes of coolant get into your eyes, rinse out your eyes immedi-
ately with clear water and contact a doctor as soon as possible.
• You should also consult a doctor without delay if you have inadvertently 
swallowed coolant.

Caution

Do not continue your journey if for some reason it is not possible under the 
conditions prevailing to top up with coolant. Switch the engine off and obtain 
professional assistance from a specialist garage, otherwise it could lead to severe 
engine damage. 

For the sake of the environment

Do not re-use coolant if it is necessary to drain the coolant in the system. It should 
be collected and disposed of in compliance with environmental protection 
regulations.

Inspecting and Replenishing

191

Radiator fan
The radiator fan may switch on suddenly.

The radiator fan is driven by an electric motor and controlled by a thermostat 
according to the coolant temperature.

The radiator fan may continue running for up to 10 minutes after the engine has 
been switched off - even if the ignition is also off. It may also switch on suddenly 
after a certain time, if
• the coolant temperature has risen because of an accumulation of heat or
• the warm engine compartment is heated up additionally by strong sunlight.

WARNING

You must therefore be aware when working in the engine compartment that 
the fan may switch on suddenly - risk of injury!

WARNING

• Using old brake fluid can result in severe stress on the brakes because of 
the formation of vapour bubbles in the brake system. This greatly impairs 
the braking efficiency and thus also the safety of your vehicle.
• Brake fluid is toxic! It must therefore be kept safely in closed original 
containers and well away from children and unauthorized persons.

Caution

Brake fluid damages the paintwork of the vehicle.

For the sake of the environment

In view of the problems involved with proper disposal of brake fluid, the special 
tools and the professional knowledge required, you should have the brake fluid 
replaced by a Škoda Service Partner.

– Pull off the rubber seal

 slightly.

AB

 ⇒ page 191, fig. 177 partially away and lift 

– Inspect the brake fluid level at the reservoir 

AA

. The level must be 

between the “MIN” and “MAX” markings. The markings are indicated 
on the side of the reservoir.

A slight drop in the fluid level results when driving due to normal wear-and-tear 
and automatic adjustment of the brake pads, and is perfectly normal.

There may be an indication of a leak in the brake system, however, if the fluid level 
drops significantly within a short time or if it drops below the “MIN” marking. A situ-
ation where the brake fluid level is too low is indicated by the warning light  
lighting up in the instrument cluster ⇒ page 29. In this case stop the car immedi-
ately and do not drive any further! Contact a Škoda Dealer to obtain profes-
sional assistance.

WARNING

• Read and observe the warning notes ⇒ page 185, “Working in the engine 
compartment” before working in the engine compartment.
• If the fluid level has dropped below the MIN marking, do not drive any 
further - risk of accident! Contact a Škoda dealer to obtain professional 
assistance.

Replacing brake fluid

Brake fluid absorbs moisture. This causes the fluid to absorb moisture from the 
surrounding air over a period of time. Excessive water in the brake fluid may be the 
cause of corrosion in the brake system. The water content also lowers the boiling

The battery is located in the engine compartment in the plenum chamber 
below a cover.

Taking off cover
– Press the cover in direction of arrow ⇒ fig. 178.

There is a risk of injuries, scalding, accidents and burns when carrying out any work 
on the battery and on the electrical system. For this reason, it is essential to comply 
with the warning instructions ⇒  stated below and with the general applicable 
rules of safety.

WARNING

• The battery acid is strongly corrosive and must, therefore, be handled 
with the greatest of care. Always wear protective gloves, eye and skin 
protection when handling batteries. Corrosive fumes in the air irritate the 
air passages and lead to conjunctivitis and inflammation of the air passages 

Inspecting and Replenishing

WARNING (continued)

in the lungs. Battery acid corrodes dental enamel and creates deep wounds 
after contact with the skin which take a long time to heal. Repeated contact 
with diluted acids causes skin diseases (inflammations, ulcers, slin cracks). 
Acids coming into contact with water are diluted accompanied by significant 
development of heat.
• Do not tilt the battery otherwise battery electrolyte may flow out of the 
battery vent openings. Protect the eyes with safety glasses or a shield! There 
is the danger of suffering blindness! If any battery electrolyte gets into your 
eye, rinse out your eye immediately with clear water for several minutes. 
Contact a doctor without delay.
• Splashes of acid on your skin or clothes should be neutralised as soon as 
possible using soap suds and then rinsed with plenty of water. Contact a 
doctor immediately if you swallow battery electrolyte.
• Keep batteries out of the reach of children.
• Hydrogen is released when you charge a battery and a highly explosive 
gas mixture is produced. An explosion can be caused through sparkling over 
during unclamping or loosening of the cable plug while the ignition is on.
• Bridging of the poles will create a short circuit (e.g. through metal 
objects, cables). Possible consequences of a short circuit: Melting of lead 
struts, explosion and burning of the battery, jets of acid spurting out.
• It is prohibited to work with a naked flame and light, to smoke or to carry 
out any activities which produce sparks. Avoid creating sparks when 
working with cables and electrical devices. Strong sparking represents a risk 
of injury.
• Before carrying out any work on the electrical system, switch off the 
engine, the ignition as well as all electrical components and disconnect the 
negative cable (-) on the battery. If you wish to replace a bulb it is sufficient 
to switch off the appropriate light.
• Never charge a frozen or thawed battery - risk of explosion and caustic 
burns! Replace a frozen battery.
• Never use a battery which is damaged - risk of explosion! Immediately 
replace a damaged battery.

Inspecting and Replenishing

Caution

• You must only disconnect the battery if the ignition is switched off, otherwise 
the electrical system (electronic components) of the vehicle may be damaged. 
When disconnecting the battery from the electrical system of the vehicle, first 
disconnect the negative terminal (-) of the battery. Then disconnect the positive 
terminal (+).
• When reconnecting the battery, first connect the positive terminal (+) and only 
then the negative terminal (-) of the battery. You must on no account connect the 
cables wrongly - risk of a cable fire!
• Ensure that battery acid does not come into contact with the vehicle body 
otherwise damage could occur to the paintwork.
• Do not place the battery in direct daylight in order to protect the battery 
housing from the effects of ultra-violet light.

For the sake of the environment

A removed battery is a special type of waste which is harmful to the environment - 
contact your specialist garage regarding disposing of the battery.

Note

Please also refer to the guidelines ⇒ page 196, “Disconnecting and reconnecting 
the battery”, also after connecting the battery.

Battery with a charge level indicator, the so-called magic eye

Fig. 179  Engine 
compartment: Battery 
with magic eye

There is a so-called magic eye ⇒ fig. 179 located on the top of the battery. The 
“magic eye” changes its colour in line with the charge state of and electrolyte level 
in the battery.

Air bubbles can influence the colour of the “magic eye”. For this reason carefully 
knock on the “magic eye” before carrying out the check.
• Green colour - the battery is adequately charged
• Dark colour - the battery has to be charged
• Colourless or yellow colour. Have the battery checked by a specialist garage
Batteries, which are more than 5 years old, must be replaced. We recommend you 
have the electrolyte level inspected and adjusted to the correct level or the battery 
replaced if necessary by a specialist garage.

Caution

If the vehicle has not been driven for more than 3 to 4 weeks, the battery will 
discharge because certain electrical components consume electricity (e.g. control 
units) also in idle state. You can prevent the discharging of the battery by discon-
necting the negative terminal or charging the battery constantly with a very low 
charging current. Please also refer to the notes when working on the battery 
⇒ page 193, “Working on the battery”.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 195  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

Inspecting the electrolyte level

The battery is practically maintenance-free under normal operating conditions. 
We do, however, recommend that you have the electrolyte level inspected from 
time to time by a specialist garage when outside temperatures are high or when 
driving on long trips. You should also check the electrolyte level ⇒ page 195 each 
time the battery is charged.

The battery acid level will also be checked as part of the Inspection Service.

Operation in winter

The battery has to provide greater amounts of electricity during the winter. It also 
has only part of the initial power output at low temperatures that it has at normal 
temperatures.

A discharged battery may already freeze at temperatures just below 0°C.

We therefore recommend that you have the battery checked by a specialist garage 
before the start of the winter, and recharged if necessary.

Note

If the vehicle is not going to be driven for a period of some weeks when there is very 
severe frost one should remove ⇒ page 196 the battery and store it in a place 
which is protected from frost. This prevents the battery from freezing up and 
thereby being destroyed.

Charging the battery
A properly charged battery is essential for reliably starting the 
engine.

– Read the warning notes ⇒  in “Working on the battery” on 

page 193 and ⇒ .

– Switch the ignition and all electrical components off.

Inspecting and Replenishing

– Only for “quick-charging”: Disconnect both battery cables (first of all 

“negative”, then “positive”).

– Carefully attach the terminal clamps of the charger to the battery 

terminals (red = “positive”, black = “negative”).

– You can now plug the mains cable of the charger into the power socket 

and switch on the charger.

– When charging is completed: switch the charger off and unplug the 

mains cable from the power socket.

– Only then should you disconnect the terminal clamps of the charger.

– Reconnect the cables to the battery (first of all “positive”, then “nega-

tive”).

It is not normally necessary to disconnect the cables of the battery if you recharge 
the battery using low amperages (as for example from a mini-charger). Please also 
refer to the instructions from the charger manufacturer.

A charging current of 0.1 of the total battery capacity (or lower) is that which should 
be used until full charging is achieved.

It is, however, necessary to disconnect both cables before charging the battery with 
high amperages, so-called “quick-charging”.
“Quick-charging” a battery is dangerous ⇒  in “Working on the battery” on 
page 193. It requires a special charger and appropriate knowledge. We therefore 
recommend that you have your battery quick-charged only by your specialist 
garage.
A discharged battery may already freeze at temperatures just below 0°C. ⇒ . We 
recommend that you no longer use a battery which has thawed out because the 
casing of the battery may be cracked through the formation of ice and this would 
allow battery electrolyte to flow out.

The vent plugs of the battery should not be opened for charging.

The windshield washer reservoir contains the cleaning fluid for the windscreen and 
for the headlamp cleaning system*. The reservoir is located in the front left of the 
engine compartment ⇒ fig. 182.
The reservoir has a capacity of 4 liters.

Clear water is not sufficient to intensively clean the windscreen and headlights. We 
therefore recommend using clean washing water together with the screen cleaner 
from Škoda genuine accessories (in winter additionally with antifreeze) which is 
capable of removing stubborn dirt. Follow the instructions for use on the packaging 
when using screen cleaning products.

You should always add antifreeze to the cleaning water in winter even if your 
vehicle is fitted with heated windscreen washer nozzles*.

It is also possible in exceptional cases to use methylated spirits when no screen 
cleaner with antifreeze is available. The concentration of methylated spirits must 
not be more than 15 %. Please note, however, that the antifreeze protection at this 
concentration is only adequate down to -5°C.

General comments

• New tyres do not offer optimal grip at first and should therefore be run in for 
about 500 km at a moderate speed and an appropriately cautious style of driving. 
You will also profit from longer tyre life.
• The tread depth of new tyres may differ because of design features and the 
configuration of the tread (depending on the type of tyre and the manufacturer).
• Drive over curbs on the side of the road and other such obstacles slowly and, 
where possible, at a right angles in order to avoid damage to tyres and wheel trims.
• Inspect your tyres from time to time for damage (punctures, cuts, splits and 
bulges). Remove foreign bodies from the tyre profile.
• Damage to tyres and wheels is frequently not visible. Unusual vibrations or 
pulling of the vehicle to one side could be a sign of tyre damage. Please reduce 
your speed immediately and stop if you suspect that a wheel is damaged. 
Inspect the tyres for signs of damage (bulges, splits, etc.) If no visible damage is 
present, please drive at an appropriately slow speed and carefully to the nearest 
specialist garage in order to have your vehicle inspected.
• Also protect your tyres from contact with oil, grease and fuel.
• Immediately replace any dust caps of the valves which have got lost.
• Mark wheels before removing them so that their previous direction of running 
can be maintained when mounted them again.
• Always store wheels or tyres which been removed in a cool, dry and, where 
possible, dark place. Tyres which are not fixed to a wheel trim should be stored 
upright.

Unidirectional tyres*
The direction of rotation of the tyres is marked by arrows on the wall of the tyre. This 
indicates the direction of rotation of the tyre, and it is essential that the tyres are 
fitted on to run in this direction. Only then are the tyres able to provide the optimal 
properties in terms of grip, low noise, wear-and-tear and aquaplaning.

Tyre life

filler flap with the tyre 
inflation pressure table

B1Z-0042H
B1Z-0042H

Fig. 184  Wheel with full 
trim and extended valve

The life of your tyres very much depends on the following points:

Tyre pressure
The working life of tyres will be shortened considerably if the tyres are insufficiently 
or over-inflated and this will have an adverse effect on the handling of your vehicle.

Correctly inflated tyres are of particular importance when travelling at high speeds. 
It is therefore good to check the pressure at least once a month and also before 
setting off on a long trip. Please do not forget the spare wheel when checking the 
tyres.

The tyre inflation pressures for summer tyres are indicated on the inside of the fuel 
filler flap ⇒ fig. 183. The inflation pressures for winter tyres are 20 kPa (0.2 bar) 
higher than those for summer tyres ⇒ page 203.

The tyre pressure should be at the highest pressure specified for your vehicle at all 
times.

On cars with full wheel trim, valve extensions are fitted in place of dust caps 
⇒ fig. 184. It is not necessary to unscrew the valve extensions in order to check and 
alter the inflation pressure of the tyre.

Always check the inflation pressure of tyres when cold. Do not reduce the higher 
pressure of warm tyres. Adapt the inflation pressure of the tyres accordingly if your 
vehicle is carrying a significantly higher payload.

Driving style
Fast cornering, sharp acceleration and braking (squealing tyres) increase wear-and-
tear on your tyres.

Balancing wheels
The wheels of a new vehicle are balanced. There are a wide range of influences 
when driving which may result in an imbalance and which makes themselves felt 
through vibration in the steering.

You should have the wheels rebalanced since any imbalance increases wear-and-
tear on the steering, the suspension and tyres. A wheel must also be rebalanced 
when a new tyre is fitted and each time a tyre is repaired.

Wheel alignment errors
Incorrect wheel alignment at the front and rear will not only increase wear-and-tear 
on the tyres but will also has an adverse effect on vehicle safety. Contact your 
specialist garage if you notice any unusual tyre wear.

WARNING

• If the inflation pressure is too low, the tyre must perform a greater flexing 
work. At higher speeds the tyre will warm up as a result of this. This can 
result in tread separation and even a tyre blowout.
• Immediately replace the damaged rims or tyres.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 201  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

For the sake of the environment

Tyres which are insufficiently inflated increase your fuel consumption.

Wear indicators

Changing wheels around

Wheels and Tyres

201

Fig. 185  Tyre tread with 
wear indicators

The base of the tread of the original tyres has wear indicators 1.6 mm high, installed 
at right angles to the direction of travel. These wear indicators are located at 6 - 8 
points depending on the make and are evenly spaced around the circumference of 
the tyre ⇒ fig. 185. Markings on the walls of the tyres through the letters “TWI”, 
triangular symbols or other symbols identify the position of the wear indicators.

A remaining tread of just 1.6 mm, measured in the grooves of the tread next to the 
wear indicators, means that your tyres have reached their legally permissible 
minimum tread depth.

WARNING

• You must have your tyres replaced with new ones at the latest when the 
wear indicators have been worn down. The legally permissible minimum 
tread depth should be observed.
• Worn tyres do not provide the necessary adhesion to the road surface at 
high speeds on wet roads. One could experience “aquaplaning” (uncon-
trolled movements of the vehicle - “swimming” on a wet road surface).

Fig. 186  Changing 
wheels around

If significantly greater wear is present on the front tyres, we recommend changing 
the front wheels around with the rear wheels as shown in the diagram ⇒ fig. 186. 
You will then obtain approximately the same life for all the tyres.

It may be advantageous to swap the tyres over “crosswise” when certain types of 
wear characteristic arise on the running surface of the tyres (but not in the case of 
unidirectional tyres). Škoda Service Partners can provide you with details.

We recommend that you change the wheels around every 10 000 km in order to 
achieve even wear on all wheels and to obtain optimal tyre life.

New tyres and wheels

Tyres and wheel rims are important design elements. One should therefore use the 
tyres and wheel rims which have been released for use by Škoda Auto. They are 
exactly matched to the vehicle type and therefore contribute significantly to good 
road holding and safe driving characteristics ⇒ .

Only fit radial tyres of the same type on all 4 wheels, size (rolling circumference) 
and, if possible, the same tread pattern on one axle.

The Škoda Service Partners have access to the most current information about 
which tyres we have released for use on your vehicle.

Wheels and Tyres

We recommend that you have any work relating to tyres or wheels carried out by 
your Škoda Service Partner. Your dealer has all of the necessary special tools and 
replacement parts available plus the required specialist knowledge and is also in a 
position to properly dispose of the old tyres. A large number of Škoda Service Part-
ners also have an attractive range of tyres and wheels available.

The tyre/wheel combinations which are approved for your vehicle are indicated in 
your vehicle documents. Approval and licensing may differ according to the legis-
lation prevailing in individual countries.

Proper knowledge of the tyre data makes it easier for you to select the correct type 
of tyre. Tyres do, for example, have the following inscription on their walls:

The date of manufacture is also stated on the tyre wall (possibly only on the inside 
of wheel):

DOT ... 20 04...

means, for example, that the tyre was manufactured in the 20th week of the year 
2004.

Any spare wheel which differs from the tyres fitted to the vehicle (e.g. winter tyres 
or low-profile tyres) should only be used only for a short time in the event of a 
puncture and when adopting an appropriately cautious style of driving. It should be 
replaced as quickly as possible by a normal wheel.

WARNING

• Only use those tyres or wheel rims which have been approved for your 
model of Škoda Auto a.s. vehicle. Failure to observe this instruction will 
adversely affect the road safety of your vehicle - risk of accident! Approval 
and licencing of your vehicle on public roads may also become void as a 
result.
• You must on no account drive at a higher speed than is permissible for 
your tyres - risk of an accident resulting from tyre damage and loss of control 
over your vehicle.
• Tyres which are 6 years old or more should only be fitted in exceptional 
cases and when adopting an appropriately cautious style of driving.
• Never fit tyres which have already been used without having adequate 
knowledge of their previous history. Tyres age even if they have not been 
used at all or only very little. A spare tyre must only be used in exceptional 
cases and only then when adopting an appropriately cautious style of 
driving.
• Do not, where possible, replace individual tyres but at least replace them 
on both wheels of a given axle at the same time. Always fit the tyres with the 
deeper tread depth to the front wheels.

For the sake of the environment

Old tyres must be disposed of in conformity with the appropriate regulations.

NKO B5 20.book  Page 203  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

Note

It is not normally possible to fit wheels from other models of cars for technical 
reasons. This may also apply in certain circumstances to the wheels of the same 
type of vehicle.

Wheel bolts

Wheels and wheel bolts are matched to each other in terms of design. Each time 
you fit other wheels - e.g. light alloy wheels or wheels with winter tyres - you must 
therefore also use the matching wheel bolts of the correct length and shape of 
spherical cap. This is essential to ensure that the wheels are tightly fitted and that 
the brake system operates properly.

If you retrofit wheel trims (or have this done), please also ensure that an adequate 
flow of air remains assured for cooling the brake system.

The Škoda Service Partners are instructed in the technical possibilities which exist 
regarding converting or retrofitting wheels, tyres and wheel trim.

WARNING

• In case of incorrect treatment of the wheel bolts, the wheel can loosen 
when the car is moving - risk of accident!
• The wheel bolts must be clean and must turn easily. However, they must 
never be treated with grease or oil.
• If the wheel bolts are tightened to a too low tightening torque, the rim 
can lossen when the car is moving - risk of accident! A tightening torque 
which is too high can damage the bolts and threads and this can result in 
permanent deformation of the contact surfaces on the rims.

Caution

The prescribed tightening torque of the wheel bolts for steel and light alloy wheels 
is 120 Nm.

Wheels and Tyres

Winter tyres

The handling of your vehicle will be significantly improved when driving on wintry 
roads if you fit winter tyres. Summer tyres do not offer the same grip on ice, snow 
and at temperatures below 7 °C because of their construction (width, rubber blend, 
tread pattern). This applies in particular to vehicles which are equipped with low-
profile tyres or high-speed tyres (code index V, W or Y on wall of tyre).

Winter tyres must be mounted on all four wheels to obtain the best handling char-
acteristics.

You must only fit those types of winter tyre which are approved for your vehicle. The 
permissible sizes of winter tyres are stated in your vehicle documents. Approvals 
may differ because of national legislation.

Please remember that the tyres should be inflated to 20 kPa (0.2 bar) more than is 
the case for summer tyres ⇒ page 200.
Winter tyres no longer offer the same winter performance once the tyre tread has 
worn down to a depth of about 4 mm.

Ageing also causes winter tyres to lose most of their winter performance properties 
- even in cases where the remaining tread depth is still clearly more than 4 mm.
Speed restrictions apply to winter tyres as well as to summer tyres ⇒ page 201, 
⇒ .

You can fit winter tyres of a lower speed category to your vehicle provided that you 
also do not drive faster than the permissible maximum speed for such tyres, even 
if the possible maximum speed of your vehicle is higher. The corresponding tyre 
category can damage the tyres when exceeding the permissible maximum speed.
Please pay attention to the notes if you decide to fit winter tyres ⇒ page 199.

You can also fit so-called “all-year tyres” instead of winter tyres.

Please contact your specialist garage if there are any points which are not clear who 
will be able to provide you with information regarding the maximum speed for your 
tyres.

Wheels and Tyres

WARNING

You must on no account drive your car at more than the permissible 
maximum speed for your winter tyres - risk of an accident resulting from 
tyre damage and loss of control over your car.

For the sake of the environment

Fit your summer tyres on again in good time since summer tyres offer you better 
grip and handling on roads which are free of snow and ice as well as ar tempera-
tures below 7 °C - the braking distance is shorter, there is less tyre noise, tyre wear 
is reduced and fuel consumption is reduced.

Note

Please observe the various differing legal requirements regarding tyres.

Unidirectional tyres*

The direction of rotation of the tyres is marked by arrows on the wall of the tyre. 
This indicates the direction of rotation of the tyre, and it is essential that the tyres 
are fitted on to run in this direction. Only then are the tyres able to provide the 
optimal properties in terms of grip, low noise, wear-and-tear and aquaplaning.

Should it be necessary to fit on a spare wheel in exceptional cases with a tyre not 
dedicated to the running direction or in opposite running direction, please adopt a 
cautious style of driving as the tyre is no longer able to provide optimal grip and 
handling in such a situation. This particularly important on wet roads. Please refer 
to the notes ⇒ page 209, “Spare wheel”.

You should have the defective tyre replaced as soon as possible and restore the 
correct direction of rotation on all tyres

Snow chains

Snow chains can be used only for wheel sizes 6J x 16 ET 40 or 6J x 16 ET 37. Your 
Škoda Service Partner can provide you with more detailed information.

Snow chains must only be mounted on the front wheels.

When driving on wintry roads, snow chains improve not only traction, but also the 
braking performance.

Only use fine-link snow chains. They must not project more than 15 mm - 
including the chain lock.

Remove the full wheel trims if you wish to fit snow chains to the wheels. 

Observe the national legal requirements relating to the maximum vehicle speed 
with snow chains.

WARNING

Please pay attention to the information in the supplied fitting instructions of 
the snow chain manufacturer.

Caution

You must take the chains off as soon as you drive on roads which are free of snow. 
They adversely affect the handling of your vehicle, damage the tyres and are rapidly 
destroyed.

Note

We recommend that you use snow chains from the Škoda genuine accessories.

Accessories and replacement parts

WARNING (continued)

Škoda vehicles have been built according to the latest discoveries in safety engi-
neering. Thus one should not change the condition in which the vehicle was deliv-
ered from the manufacturer without some thought.

The following guidelines should be observed when a vehicle is to be retrofitted with 
accessories, have technical changes made to it or a part has to be replaced at some 
time in the future.
• Advise should always be obtained from a Škoda Service Partner before buying 
any accessories and before making any technical changes ⇒ .
• This is particularly the case when accessories are bought in a foreign country.
• Škoda Genuine Accessories which have been released for use and Skoda orig-
inal parts can be obtained from Škoda Service Partners. They will install them 
professionally and correctly.
• All Škoda original accessory which is listed in the catalogue such as tilting roofs, 
spoilers, wheels etc. must have an official stamp of approval.
• Radios, aerials and other electrical accessories should only be installed by an 
authorised workshop.
• The guidelines issued by Škoda Auto a.s. must be observed when making tech-
nical changes.
• This is to ensure that no technical damage occurs to the vehicle, that travelling 
and operating safety are maintained and that the chnages are permissible. Škoda 
Service Partners undertake this work professionally or refer it to an specialist 
company in special cases.

Any damage which is done caused by technical changes made without 
consulting a Skoda a.s. dealer is excluded from the guarantee.

WARNING

• We advise you, in your own interest, to only use Škoda Genuine Accesso-
ries and Škoda original parts which have been expressly approved for use on 

your Škoda. Reliability, safety and suitabiliity have been established for 
these Škoda original parts.
• We cannot guarantee suitability of installation into your vehicle of other 
products despite keeping a constant eye on market developments (also not 
in the case where there is an attestation or permission can be produced).

Technical changes

Interference on the electronic components and their software can lead to opera-
tional faults. This interference can also impair not directly affected systems because 
of the networking of the electronic components. This means that the operating 
safety of your vehicle can be considerably jeopardized, a greater wear of vehicle 
parts can occur and finally the vehicle registration documents expire.

We trust that you will understand that your Škoda Service Partner cannot be liable 
for damage resulting from unprofessional work.

We therefore recommend that you have all work carried out with Škoda original 
parts at your authorised Škoda Service Partners.

WARNING

Work or modifications on your vehicle, which have been carried out unpro-
fessionally, can cause operational faults - risk of accident!

WARNING

• Always raise the vehicle with the doors closed - risk of injury.
• Take suitable measures to prevent the base of the lifting jack from slip-
ping off - risk of injury!
• Place the lifting jack only on a solid and even surface.
• Not positioning the lifting jack at the specified points can result in 
damage to the vehicle. The jack can also slip off if it does not have sufficient 
grip - risk of injury!
• Never start the engine if the vehicle is lifted - risk of accident.
• Never lie under the vehicle if the vehicle is only lifted with the vehicle 
lifting jack.
• It is important to support the vehicle with suitable supporting blocks if 
you wish to work under the lifted vehicle - risk of injury!

– Turn the lifting jack up further until the wheel is just clear of the 

ground.

Ground below the lifting jack which is soft and slippery can cause the vehicle to 
slip off the jack. It is therefore always necessary to place the lifting jack on a solid 
surface. Use a wide, stable base, if necessary. Use a non-slip base (e.g. a rubber foot 
mat) if the surface is smooth, such as cobbled stones, a tiled floor, etc.

possible. The tightening torque must be 120 Nm.

The safety wheel bolts on vehicles fitted with them (one safety wheel bolt per 
wheel) can only be loosened or tighten up by using the adapter provided.

It is meaningful to note the code number hammered into the rear side of the 
adapter or the rear side of the safety wheel bolts. You can obtain a replacement 
adapter from a Škoda Service Partner, if necessary, by quoting this number.

We recommend that you always carry the adapter for the wheel bolts with you in 
the vehicle. It should be stowed in the vehicle tool kit.

Caution

• Damage can occur to the adapter and safety wheel bolt if the safety wheel bolt 
is tightened up too much.
• On steel wheels, the theft-deterrent wheel bolt must always be installed in the 
hole, which is close to the valve. Otherwise the full wheel trim cannot be mounted 
and the full wheel trim can be damaged during the assembly.

Note

Jump-starting

Initial steps

You can use the battery of another vehicle for jump-starting yours if the engine 
does not start because the battery on your vehicle is flat. You will require jump-start 
cables for this purpose.

Both batteries must have a rated voltage of 12 V. The capacity (Ah) of the battery 
supplying the power must not be significantly less than the capacity of the 
discharged battery in your vehicle.

Jump-start cables
Only use jump-start cables which have an adequately large cross-section and insu-
lated terminal clamps. Please pay attention to the manufacturer's instructions.

Positive cable - colour coding in the majority of cases red.

Negative cable - colour coding in the majority of cases black.

WARNING

• A discharged battery may already freeze at temperatures just below 0°C. 
In case of frozen battery carry out no jump-starting - risk of explosion! Also 
after thawing of the battery  there is a risk of caustic burns due to leaking 
acid. Replace the frozen battery.
• Please pay attention to the warning instructions relating to working in 
the engine compartment ⇒ page 185.

Note

• There must not be any contact between the two vehicles otherwise current may 
flow as soon as the negative terminals are connected.
• The discharged battery must be properly connected to the system of the 
vehicle.
• Switch off any mobile phone, pay attention to the instructions for use of the 
mobile phone in such a situation.

Tow-starting and towing vehicle

General

Please pay attention to the following instructions if you are going to use a 
tow rope:

Driver of the towing vehicle
– Do not drive off until the tow rope is taught.

– Release the clutch particularly gently when starting off or depress the 

accelerator particularly gently if your vehicle is fitted with an auto-
matic gearbox.

Driver of the towed vehicle
– Switch the ignition on so that the steering wheel is not blocked and 
you can also operate the turn signal lights, the headlight flasher, the 
windscreen wipers and windscreen washer system.

– Take the vehicle out of gear or move the selector lever into position N 

if your vehicle is fitted with an automatic gearbox.

– Note that the brake servo unit and power steering only operate if the 
engine is running. You will require significantly greater physical force 
to depress the brake pedal and to steer the vehicle if the engine is not 
running.

– Ensure that the tow rope is always kept taught.

Tow rope or tow bar
A tow bar is safest way of towing a vehicle and also minimizes any shocks. You can 
use a tow rope only if a suitable tow bar is not available.

The tow rope must be elastic to protect the vehicle. Thus one should only use 
plastic fibre rope or a rope made out of a similarly elastic material.

Breakdown assistance

217

Attach the tow rope or the tow bar only to the towing eyes provided for this 
purpose ⇒ page 218, “Front towing eye” and ⇒ page 218, “Rear towing eye”.

Driving style
Towing another vehicle requires a certain amount of practice. Both drivers should 
be familiar with the particular points about towing a vehicle. Unskilled drivers 
should not attempt to tow in another vehicle or to be towed in.

One should be constantly vigilant not to allow impermissibly high towing forces or 
jerky loadings. There is always a risk of excessive stresses and damage resulting at 
the points to which you attach the tow rope or tow bar when you attempt to tow a 
vehicle which is not standing on a paved road.

Caution

If the gearbox of your vehicle no longer contains any oil because of a defect, your 
vehicle must only be towed in with the driven wheels raised clear of the ground, or 
on a special vehicle transporter or trailer.

Note

• Please comply with any legal requirements particularly regarding the switched 
on signal systems, when towing in or tow-starting another vehicle.
• The tow rope must not be twisted as it may in certain circumstances result in the 
front towing eye being unscrewed out of your vehicle.

Caution

Vehicles which are fitted with a catalytic converter should not be tow-started over 
a distance of more than 50 metres. Unburnt fuel may get into the catalytic converter 
and damage it.

Towing in a vehicle fitted with a manual gearbox

Please refer to the notes ⇒ page 217.

The car can be towed in with a tow bar or a tow rope or with the front or rear wheels 
raised. The maximum towing speed is 50 km/h.

If the engine does not start, we generally do not recommend to tow-start 
your vehicle. One should attempt to start the engine using jump start 
cables ⇒ page 215 or call on the services of the SERVICE mobile.

If your vehicle has to be towed:
– Engage 2nd or 3rd gear with the vehicle stationary.

Towing of a vehicle with an automatic gearbox

Please refer to the notes ⇒ page 217.

The car can be towed in with a tow bar or a tow rope. Refer at the same time to the 
following guidelines:

Breakdown assistance

219

NKO B5 20.book  Page 219  Friday, March 2, 2007  1:46 PM

• Move selector lever into N.
• The maximum towing speed is 50 km/h.
• The maximum permissible towing distance is 50 km. The gear oil pump does 
not operate when the engine is not running and the gear would not be adequately 
lubricated at higher speeds and over longer towing distance.

Caution

If the vehicle is towed in by a recovery vehicle, it should only be towed in with the 
front wheels raised. If the vehicle is raised at rear, the automatic gearbox is 
damaged!

Note

The vehicle must be transported on a special vehicle or trailer if it is not possible to

– Take the plastic clip out of its fixture in the fuse cover, insert it onto the 

respective fuse and pull out this fuse.

– Defect fuses can be detected by their melted metal strips. Replace the 

defect fuse by a new fuse of the same ampere number.

– Fit on the fuse cover again.

We recommend that you carry the box of replacement fuses with you which was 
delivered in your vehicle. You can obtain replacement fuses 6) from a Škoda Service 
Partner.

Caution

• Never attempt to “repair” fuses and also do not replace them with a fuse of a 
higher amperage - risk of fire! This may also cause damage at another part of the 
electrical system.
• Have the electrical system checked as quickly as possible by a specialist garage 
if a newly inserted fuse blows again after a short time.

Note

We recommend that you have these fuses replaced by a specialist garage.

6) Replacement fuses are, on the other hand, part of the basic equipping of the vehicle in some

countries.

Bulbs

Changing bulbs

The relevant lamp must always be switched off before a light bulb is replaced.

Do not take hold of the glass bulb with naked fingers (even the smallest amount of 
dirt reduces the working life of the light bulb). Use a clean cloth, serviette or some-
thing similar.

Amperes

Defect light bulbs should only be replaced with light bulbs of the same type. The 
designation is located on the light socket or the glass bulb.

Changing certain bulbs is not something which you can do yourself, but requires to 
be done by a specialist. Other parts of the vehicle must be removed in order to 
change the light bulbs. This applies, in particular, to bulbs which can only be 
reached from the engine compartment.

We therefore recommend that you have any bulbs changed by a Škoda Service 
Partner or, in exceptional cases, by calling on other professional assistance.
Please note that the engine compartment is a hazardous area ⇒ page 185, 
“Working in the engine compartment”.

We recommend that you carry the set of light bulbs with you which was delivered 
in your vehicle. Replacement light bulbs 7) are available at specialist garages.
Fitted with a xenon headlight

Change of light bulbs on Xenon lights (low beam lights, parking lights and main 
beam lights) should be undertaken by a specialist garage.

• Bulbs H7 and H3 are pressurised and may burst when changing the bulb 
- risk of injury!
• It is recommended to wear gloves and eye protection when changing a 
light bulb.
• Gas discharge bulbs* (xenon bulbs) operate with a high voltage, profes-
sional knowledge is required - danger to life!

Note

This Owner's Manual only describes the replacement of bulbs where it is assumed 
that no major complications will arise. Other light bulbs should be changed by your 
specialist garage.

Vehicles for certain export countries do not have a type plate.

Sticker on inside of fuel filler flap
The sticker is affixed to the inside of the fuel filler flap. The sticker contains the 
following data:
• The prescribed types of fuel,

• Tyre size,
• Tyre pressure.

Fuel consumption according to the regulations 
(99/100/EU)

Depending on the range of the special equipment, style of driving, traffic situation, 
weather influences and vehicle condition, the consumption values which in prac-
tice result when using the vehicle can deviate from the indicated values.

Urban traffic
The consumption measurement in urban traffic begins with starting of the cold 
engine. Afterwards the normal urban traffic is simulated.

Non-urban traffic
For the consumption measurement in non-urban traffic the vehicle, as in daily 
motoring, is accelerated and braked several times in all gears. The vehicle speed 
changes within the range from 0 to 120 km/h.

Combined traffic
The consumption value in the combined traffic consists of 37% from the value for 
the urban traffic and of 63% from the value for the non-urban traffic.

OWNER´ S MANUAL

SIMPLY CLEVER

How you can contribute to a cleaner environment

The fuel consumption of your Škoda - and thus the level of pol-
lutants contained in the exhaust - is also determined by how 
you drive.

The noise level and wear and tear are also influenced by how 
you personally handle your vehicle.  This Owner ´s Manual tells 
you how to drive your Škoda to achieve the minimum impact 
on the environment, and how to save money at the same time. 
Look up „Environment“ in the Index to find out more.

Please also refer to all the texts identified with a ; in this 
Owner ´s Manual.

Make your contribution - for the sake of the environ-
ment.
