materials defect liability and ŠKODA warranty for new
cars

Materials defect liability
Your ŠKODA Partner, as a vendor, is liable to you for material damage to your
new ŠKODA car, ŠKODA Genuine Parts or ŠKODA Genuine Accessories in ac-
cordance with statutory regulations and the purchase agreement.

ŠKODA warranty for new cars
As well as the materials defect liability, ŠKODA AUTO grants you the ŠKODA
warranty for new cars (hereinafter referred to as “ŠKODA warranty),” accord-
ing to the conditions described below.
As part of the ŠKODA warranty, ŠKODA AUTO will provide the following serv-
ices.
▶ Free repair of faulty components or vehicle defects that occur within two

years from the start of the ŠKODA warranty.

▶ Free repair of paint work defects on your vehicle that occur within three

years from the start of the ŠKODA warranty.

▶ Free repair of corrosion caused by rust on the bodywork of your vehicle that
occurs within twelve years from the start of the warranty. Only corrosion of
body panels from the inside to the outside is included in the definition of cor-
rosion caused by rust on the bodywork and covered by the ŠKODA warranty.

The start of warranty is the date on which the new car is handed over to the
initial purchaser by the ŠKODA Partner1). This date must be noted down by the
ŠKODA Partner in the Owner's Manual for your vehicle » in the section on the
documentation of the vehicle handover.
Vehicle repairs may be carried out either by replacing the faulty part or by re-
pairing it. Replaced parts become the property of the ŠKODA Service Partner.
There shall be no further claims arising from the ŠKODA warranty. In particu-
lar, there shall be no claims for replacement, cancellation, provision of a cour-
tesy vehicle for the duration of repairs or compensation for damages.
The ŠKODA warranty is valid at any ŠKODA service partner.

1) Due to the requirements of the generally binding country-specific regula-

tions, the date of first registration can be given instead of the date of the ve-
hicle handover.

4

materials defect liability and ŠKODA warranty for new cars

A prerequisite for carrying out work under the ŠKODA warranty is that all
service work has been carried out in a timely and technically correct manner
and in accordance with the ŠKODA AUTO's provisions. It must be proven that
service work has been carried out properly and in accordance with the ŠKODA
AUTO's provisions when making a claim on the ŠKODA warranty. In the event
of a missed service or failure to carry out a service according to the ŠKODA
AUTO's provisions, you may still be entitled to warranty claims as long as you
can prove that the missed service or the failure to carry out a service accord-
ing to the ŠKODA AUTO's provisions was not the cause of the defect.
Natural wear and tear to your vehicle is not covered by the ŠKODA warranty.
The ŠKODA warranty also does not cover faults to bodywork, installations or
conversions provided by third parties, or vehicle faults caused as a result. The
same applies to accessories that were not installed and/or delivered ex-facto-
ry.
In addition, this warranty does not apply if the defect was caused by one of the
following:
▶ Unauthorised use, improper handling (e.g. use in racing competitions or over-

loading), improper care and maintenance or unauthorised modifications to
your vehicle.

▶ Non-compliance with instructions in the Owner's Manual or other factory-

supplied instructions.

▶ External causes or influences (e.g. accidents, hail, flooding etc.).
▶ Parts fitted or connected on or in the vehicle whose use has not been ap-

proved by ŠKODA AUTO, or modification of the vehicle in a manner not ap-
proved by ŠKODA AUTO (e.g. tuning).

▶ Damage caused by you that was not immediately seen to by a specialist ga-

rage or was not rectified properly.

It is the customer's responsibility to prove that s/he is not the cause of the
damage.
This ŠKODA warranty does not affect the purchaser's statutory rights from
materials defect liability from the vehicle vendor and other potential claims
from product liability laws.



Mobility warranty
The mobility warranty provides a sense of security when travelling in your ve-
hicle.
As part of the mobility warranty, if your car breaks down as a result of an unex-
pected fault when you are on the move, you can access services to ensure
your continued mobility. These services include the following: Breakdown
service at the breakdown location and towing to the ŠKODA Service Partner,
technical assistance by phone or on-site operation.
If your vehicle is not repaired on the same day, the ŠKODA Service Partner
may provide further services as required, such as replacement transportation
(bus, train etc.) or a courtesy vehicle etc.
More information regarding terms and conditions for the provision of a mobili-
ty warranty for your vehicle can be obtained from your ŠKODA Partner. They
will also provide you with detailed terms and conditions for the mobility war-
ranty with respect to your vehicle. In the event that there is no mobility war-
ranty coverage in place for your vehicle, you should check with any ŠKODA
Service Partner about the possibility of a supplementary agreement.

Optional ŠKODA extended warranty
If you opted for a ŠKODA extended warranty when purchasing your new car,
the two-year ŠKODA warranty in relation to carrying out warranty repairs free
of change is extended by the period you chose or until the chosen mileage lim-
it has been reached, whichever occurs first.
The paint warranty and the warranty against corrosion described above are
unaffected by the ŠKODA extended warranty.
The ŠKODA extended warranty does not apply to external and internal foils.
The information on the detailed conditions of the ŠKODA extended warranty is
provided by your ŠKODA partner.

Note

The ŠKODA extended warranty is only available in some countries.

WARNING

WARNING

■ The adjustable seats and all head restraints must be adjusted to match
the body size at all times and the seat belt must always be fastened proper-
ly to provide the most effective levels of protection to the passengers.
■ Each occupant must correctly fasten the seat belt belonging to the seat.
Children must be fastened » page 17, Transporting children safely with a
suitable restraint system.
■ The seat backrests must not be tilted too far back when driving, as this
will impair the function of the seat belts and of the airbag system – risk of
injury!

■ A distance of least 25 cm to the steering wheel should be maintained,
otherwise the airbag system will not be able to protect you - hazard!
■ When driving, hold the steering wheel with both hands firmly on the out-
er edge in the “9 o'clock” and “3 o'clock” position » Fig. 4. Never hold the
steering wheel in the “12 o'clock” position or in any other way (e.g. in the
middle, inner edge of the steering wheel or similar). Otherwise, you could
sustain serious injury to the arms, hands and head if the airbag is activated.
■ Ensure there are no objects in the driver's footwell as they may get be-
hind the pedals while driving. You would then no longer be able to operate
the clutch, brake or acceleration pedals.

WARNING

By sitting incorrectly, the occupant is risking life-threatening injuries.

Correct seating position for the front passenger
 Read and observe 

 on page 10 first.

For passenger safety and to reduce the risk of injury in an accident, the follow-
ing instructions must be observed.


Position the front passenger seat back as far as possible. The front pas-
senger must maintain a distance of at least 25 cm to the dash panel so
that the airbag offers the greatest possible safety if it is deployed.
Correctly fasten the seat belt » page 13.



WARNING

■ A distance of least 25 cm to the dash panel should be maintained, other-
wise the airbag system will not be able to protect you - hazard!
■ Always keep your feet in the footwell when the car is being driven – nev-
er place your feet on the instrument panel, out of the window or on the
surface of the seats! You will be exposed to increased risk of injury if it be-
comes necessary to apply the brake or in the event of an accident. If an air-
bag is deployed, you could suffer fatal injuries by adopting an incorrect
seated position!

Correct seating position for the passengers in the rear seats
 Read and observe 

 on page 10 first.

For the safety of the passengers in the rear seats, and to reduce the risk of in-
jury in an accident, the following instructions must be observed.


Adjust the head restraint so that the top edge of the head restraint is at
the same level as the upper part of your head.
Correctly fasten the seat belt » page 13.



Seat belts

Using seat belts

 Introduction

Seat belts that are fastened correctly offer good protection in the event of an
accident. They reduce the risk of an injury and increase the chance of survival
in the event of a major accident.
The seat belts reduce the kinetic energy (energy of motion) to a considerable
extent. They also prevent uncontrolled movements which, in turn, may well re-
sult in severe injuries.
When transporting a child the following instructions must be observed
» page 17, Transporting children safely.

WARNING

■ Fasten seat belts before every ride! This also applies to other passengers -
there is a danger of injury!
■ Maximum seat belt protection is only achieved if you are correctly seated
» page 9, Correct and safe seat position.
■ The seat backrests of the front seats must not be tilted too far to the rear
otherwise the seatbelts can lose their effectiveness.

WARNING

Information on dealing with the safety belts
■ The belt webbing must not be jammed in-between at any point or twis-
ted, or chafe against any sharp edges.
■ Make sure you do not catch the seat belt when closing the door.

WARNING

Information on the proper use of the safety belts
■ No two persons (also not children) should ever use a single seat belt to-
gether.
■ The lock tongue should only be inserted into the lock which is the correct
one for your seat. Wrong use of the safety belt will reduce its capacity to
protect and the risk of injury increases.



Seat belts

11

WARNING (Continued)

■ Many layers of clothing and loose clothing (e. g. a winter coat over a jack-
et) do not allow you to be correctly seated and impairs proper operation of
the seat belts.
■ Do not use clamps or other objects to adjust seat belts (e.g. for shorten-
ing the belts for smaller persons).
■ The seat belts for the rear seats can only fulfil their function reliably when
the seat backrests are correctly locked into position » page 50.

WARNING

Information on the care and maintenance of the safety belts
■ The belt webbing must always be kept clean. Soiled belt webbing may im-
pair proper operation of the inertia reel » page 106.
■ The seat belts must not be removed or changed in any way. Do not at-
tempt to repair the seat belts yourself.
■ Check the condition of all the seat belts on a regular basis. If damage to
the parts of the seat belt system (e.g. the strap, the belt connectors, the re-
tractor, the lock or similar) are detected, the seat belt in question must be
replaced immediately by a specialist.
■ Seat belts which have been subjected to stress in an accident should be
replaced by a specialist garage. Also check the seat belt anchors.

Correct routing of seat belt

 Read and observe 

 on page 11 first.

It is important that the belt is properly routed to ensure seat belts offer the
maximum protection.
The shoulder belt should be positioned approximately over the middle of your
shoulder (on no account across your neck) and lie flush to the chest » Fig. 6 -
.
The lower part of the belt should run across the pelvis (it should not lie on top
of the stomach) and must always fit snugly » Fig. 6 - .
For pregnant women, the lower part of the belt must be positioned as low
down as possible across the pelvis, to avoid exerting any pressure on the lower
abdomen » Fig. 6 - .

WARNING

■ Always ensure that the webbing of the seat belts is properly routed. Seat
belts which are not correctly adjusted can themselves cause injuries even in
minor accidents.
■ A seat belt which is hanging too loose can result in injuries as your body is
moved forward by the kinetic energy produced in an accident and is then
suddenly held firm by the belt.
■ The belt webbing must not run across solid or fragile objects (e.g. pencils,
spectacles, pens, keys etc.). Such objects can cause injury.

Safety

Fastening and unfastening seat belts

Inertia reels and belt tensioners

Fig. 7  Fastening / unfastening the seat belt

 Read and observe 

 on page 11 first.

Before fastening the belt
› Adjust the head restraint properly (does not apply to seats with integrated
head restraints).
› Adjust the seat (applies to the front seats).
Fastening
› Slowly pull the belt over the chest and pelvis.
› Insert the lock tongue into the belt buckle » Fig. 7 –  that is part of the seat
until it clicks into place.
› Pull on the belt to check that it has engaged correctly in the lock.
Releasing
› Grip the lock tongue and press the red button in the buckle » Fig. 7 - , the
lock tongue pops out.
› Guide the belt back by hand so that the seat belt does not twist and the
webbing rolls up fully.

WARNING

The reel opening for the lock tongue must not be blocked otherwise the
lock tongue will not lock into place properly.

Inertia reels

Each seat belt is equipped with an inertia reel.
When pulling slowly on the seat belt, the belt can move freely. When pulling
sharply on the seat belt, the movement is locked by the inertia reel. The belts
also lock when full braking, when the car accelerates, when driving downhill
and when cornering.

WARNING

If the seat belt does not lock when pulling sharply on it, have it inspected
immediately by a specialist garage.

Belt tensioners

Safety for the driver and front passenger wearing their seat belts is enhanced
by the belt tensioners fitted to the inertia reels of the front three-point seat
belts.
If there is a collision of a certain severity, the seat belts are tightened by the
belt tensioner so that unwanted body motion is prevented.
Belt tensioners are not activated in the event of minor collisions, in the case of
a roll-over and also not in accidents in which no major forces are produced.

WARNING

■ Any work on the belt tensioner system, including the removal and installa-
tion of system components because of other repair work, must only be car-
ried out by a specialist garage.
■ If the belt tensioners have been deployed, it is then necessary to replace
the entire system.

Note

■ The belt tensioners can also be deployed if the seat belts are not fastened.
■ Smoke is generated when the belt tensioners are deployed. This is not an in-
dication of a fire in the vehicle.

Airbag system

Description of the airbag system

 Introduction

The airbag system provides, as a supplement to the seat belts, additional occu-
pant protection during severe frontal and side-on collisions.
The airbag will only provide optimum protection in conjunction with wear-
ing the seat belt - the airbag is not a substitute for the seat belts.
The status of the airbag system is indicated by the warning light  in the in-
strument cluster » page 29.

System description

Side airbags Head-Thorax - The stress on occupants’ bodies is cushioned
when they make contact with the fully-inflated airbag and the risk of injury to
head and the entire upper body (chest, stomach and pelvis) is reduced on the
side facing the door.
The side air bags can be identified by a label with the lettering  marked on
the front seat backrests.

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the airbag system consists of the
following parts.
▶ Individual airbags.
▶ Warning light  in the instrument cluster » page 29.
▶ Key switch for the front passenger airbag » page 16.
▶ Warning light for the front passenger airbag in the middle of the dash panel

» page 16.

Front airbags - the forward thrust of the driver and of the front passenger is
cushioned when they make contact with the fully-inflated airbag, and the risk
of injury to head and chest is thus reduced.
The front airbags can be identified by the lettering  featured on the steer-
ing wheel and on the dash panel on the passenger side.

Safety

Fig. 9  Inflated airbags

The airbag system is only functional when the ignition is switched on.
When triggered, the airbag fills with gas and unfolds. The inflation of the air-
bag is carried out in a fraction of a second.
When the airbag inflates, smoke is released. This is not a sign of a fire in the
vehicle.



Triggering conditions
It is not possible to generally determine which deployment conditions apply to
the airbag system in every situation. The important factors here are the hard-
ness of the object with which the vehicle collides, the angle of impact, vehicle
speed etc.
The deceleration during impact plays an important role in the deployment of
the airbags. If the vehicle deceleration which occurs and is measured remains
below the prescribed reference values specified in the control unit, the airbags
are not deployed although the vehicle may well suffer severe damage to the
bodywork as a consequence of the accident.

The following airbags will be deployed in the event of a severe frontal
collision.
▶ Driver’s front airbag.
▶ Front passenger airbag.

The following airbags will be deployed in the event of a severe side
collision.
▶ Head-Thorax side airbag on the crash side.

When an airbag is deployed, the following events occur.
▶ The hazard warning lights are switched on.
▶ All doors are unlocked.
▶ The fuel supply to the engine is interrupted.
▶ The interior light comes on (if the automatic operation of the interior light is

switched on - position ).

When there is no air bag deployment?
With minor frontal and side collisions, rear collision, overturning of the vehicle
or vehicle roll-over there is no airbag deployment.

Safety instructions

Fig. 10 
Safe distance from the steering
wheel and dash panel

WARNING

General information
■ The seat belts and the airbag system can only offer proper protection
if the driver and passengers are seated properly » page 9.
■ The airbag unleashes enormous force when triggered, which can lead to
serious injuries or fatalities if the driver and passengers are not seated
properly. This applies in particular to children who are transported without
using a suitable child safety seat » page 19.
■ If there is a fault, have the airbag system checked immediately by a spe-
cialist garage. Otherwise, there is a risk that the airbag will not be deployed
in the event of an accident.
■ If the airbag has been deployed, the airbag system must then be replaced.
■ The surface of the steering wheel and the dash panel should only be
cleaned with a dry or slightly dampened cloth in the area of the front air-
bags.

WARNING

Information about the front airbags
■ For the driver and front passenger, it is important to maintain a distance
of at least 25 cm from the steering wheel or the dashboard » Fig. 10 -  A . If
you do not keep this distance, the airbag system cannot protect you - haz-
ard! The front seats must always be set correctly according to the body
size.
■ The front passenger airbag must be deactivated if using a rear-facing
child seat on the front passenger seat » page 16, Airbag deactivation. If
this is not done, there is a risk of the child suffering severe or even fatal in-
juries if the front passenger airbag is deployed.
■ No other persons, animals or objects should be placed in front of the oc-
cupants in the front seats in the deployment area of the front airbags.
■ The steering wheel and the surface of the dash panel on the passenger
side must not be stickered, covered or modified in any way. No parts (e.g.
cup holders, mobile phone mounts and the like) may be mounted near the
airbag installation points and in the airbag deployment area.
■ Never place objects on the surface of the dash panel on the passenger
side.

WARNING

Information about the side airbags
■ No objects (e.g. sun visors pivoted towards the windows) should be
placed in the deployment area of the side airbag, and no accessories (e.g.
cup holders and the like) should be mounted on the doors - danger of in-
jury!
■ Hang only light clothing on the hooks in the vehicle, do not leave any
heavy or sharp objects in the pockets. Do not use hangers to hang up the
clothes.
■ The airbag system operates using pressure sensors located in the front
doors. For this reason, no adjustments may be carried out to the doors or
door panels (e.g. installation of additional loudspeakers). Further informa-
tion » page 103.
■ No excessive force, e.g. through blows, kicks etc. should be applied to the
seat backrests - there is a risk of damage to the side airbags. The side air-
bags would not be deployed in such a case!
■ Any seat or protective covers which you fit to the driver or front passen-
ger seats must only be of a type expressly authorised by ŠKODA AUTO. In
view of the fact that the airbag inflates out of the backrest of the seat, use
of non-approved seat or protective covers would considerably impair the
protective function of the side airbag.
■ Any damage to the original seat covers or stitching at the installation
points for the side airbags should be immediately repaired by a specialist
company.

WARNING

Information on the use of the airbag system
■ Any work on the airbag system, including the installation and removal of
system components due to other repair work (e.g. removal of the steering
wheel), must only be carried out by a specialist garage. Further information
» page 103.
■ No changes of any sort should be made to parts of the airbag system, the
front bumper or the bodywork.
■ Do not manipulate individual parts of the airbag system, as this might re-
sult in the airbag being deployed.

Airbag deactivation

Deactivating airbags

The front passenger airbag can be switched off with the key-operated switch
» Fig. 11 on page 16 - .
We recommend that you ask a ŠKODA service partner to deactivate any other
airbags.
A warning light indicates that the airbag has been  deactivated » page 29.

Deactivating an airbag should be considered in cases such as the ones
below.
▶ A child seat is mounted on the front passenger seat, in which the child is

transported with its back to the direction of travel » page 17.

▶ Despite correct adjustment of the driver's seat, the distance of at least

25 cm between the middle of the steering wheel and chest cannot be main-
tained;

▶ Additional controls for drivers with a physical disability are installed in the ve-

hicle.

▶ Special seats (e.g. orthopaedic seats without side airbags) are installed in the

vehicle.

WARNING

If an airbag is deactivated at the time of the vehicle being sold, the purchas-
er must be informed!

Transporting children safely

Child seat

 Introduction
To reduce the risk of injury in an accident, children should only be transported
in child seats!

Please refer to the instructions in this Owner's Manual and the child seat man-
ufacturer's instructions with regard to the installation and use of the child seat.
For safety reasons, we recommend that you always transport children on the
rear seats. Only transport a child on the passenger seat in exceptional circum-
stances.
Child seats complying with the ECE-R 44 Economic Commission for Europe
standard must be used.
Child seats that comply with the ECE-R 44 standard are identified with a test
mark that cannot be removed: a large E within a circle with the test number
below.

WARNING

■ One should never carry children, and also not babies! - on one's lap.
■ When leaving the vehicle, do not leave children unattended in the vehicle.
Children might not be capable of leaving the vehicle or helping themselves
independently in the event of an emergency. Danger to life at very high or
very low temperatures!
■ The child must be secured in the vehicle during the entire journey! Other-
wise, the child would be thrown through the vehicle in the event of an acci-
dent, causing fatal injuries to both the child and other occupants.
■ Children are exposed to an increased risk of injury in the event of an acci-
dent if they lean forward or adopt an incorrect seated position when the
vehicle is moving. This particularly applies to children who are transported
on the front passenger seat as they can suffer severe, or even fatal injuries
if the airbag system is deployed!
■ Pay particular attention to the information provided by the manufacturer
of the child safety seat regarding the correct routing of the belt. Seat belts
which are not correctly adjusted can themselves cause injuries even in mi-
nor accidents.



Transporting children safely

17

WARNING (Continued)

■ Safety belts must be checked to ensure that they are running properly.
One should also ensure that the belt is not damaged by sharp-edged fit-
tings.
■ When installing the child seat on the back seat, the corresponding front
seat must be adjusted so that there is no contact between the front seat
and the child seat or the child being transported in a child seat.

CAUTION

■ When installing a child seat in which the child faces forward, adjust the head
restraints so that they are as high as possible (valid for the rear seats).
■ If the head restraints still prevent the child seat from being installed, even in
the highest position, you will need to remove them (valid for the rear seats)
» page 51. After removing the child seat, refit the head restraints.

Note

We recommend that you use child seats from ŠKODA Original Accessories.
These child seats were developed and also tested for use in ŠKODA vehicles.
They meet the ECE-R 44 standard.

Use of a child seat on the front passenger seat
Does not apply to Taiwan

 Read and observe 

 and 

 on page 17 first.

Never use a rearward-facing child restraint system on a seat which is pro-
tected by an active airbag. This could cause serious injury to the child, or
even death.
This warning is also given on stickers that are located in the following places.
▶ On the passenger sun visor » Fig. 12 - .
▶ On the B-column on the front passenger side » Fig. 12 – .
The following instructions must be followed when using a child seat on the
front passenger seat.
▶ It is essential to deactivate the front passenger airbag if using a child seat in
which the child is transported with its back facing the direction of travel » 

.
▶ If possible, adjust the front passenger seat backrest so that it is as vertical, so

as to ensure secure contact between the passenger seat backrest and the
back of the child seat.

▶ If possible, move the front passenger seat backwards so that there is no con-

tact between the front passenger seat and the child seat behind it.

▶ Set the height-adjustable front passenger seat as high up as possible.
▶ With child safety seats in groups 2 and 3, make sure that the loop-around fit-

tings attached to the child seat headrest is positioned in front of or at the
same height as the loop-around fittings on the B pillar on the passenger side.

WARNING

■ Never use a rear-facing child seat on the front passenger seat if the pas-
senger airbag is activated. This child safety seat is positioned in the deploy-
ment area of the front passenger airbag. The airbag may cause the child se-
vere, or even fatal injuries, in the event of it being deployed.
■ Once a child seat in which the child is transported with its back to the di-
rection of travel is no longer being used on the passenger seat, the front
passenger airbag should be reactivated.

Overview of driving data (depending on the vehicle equipment).
Clock - current time is displayed.
Outside temperature - If the outside temperature drops below +4 °C, the
temperature indicator appears and a snowflake symbol  (display for low tem-
perature) flashes for a few seconds, then remains displayed together with the
outside temperature.
Driving time - Driving time since last clearing the memory.

Current fuel consumption - When the vehicle is stationary or moving slowly,
the fuel consumption is displayed in l/h (in models in some countries the fol-
lowing appears --,- km/l). With G-TEC vehicles the current consumption of the
fuel currently being used is displayed ( with regards to a stationary or slow
moving vehicle, the natural gas consumption is displayed in kg/h).
Average fuel consumption - Is calculated continuously since the last clearing
of the memory. After erasing the memory, no data will appear for the first 300
m driven. With G-TEC vehicles, the average consumption of fuel currently be-
ing used is displayed.
Natural gas quality - The details of the quality of natural gas are displayed as a
percentage of between 70% to 100%. The higher the value of natural gas, the
lower is the consumption.
Range - Drive distance in km which can be covered with the existing tank ca-
pacity and with the same driving style. If you drive more efficiently this value
can increase. With G-TEC vehicles the following details are displayed - Range
with natural gas / petrol.
Distance driven - Distance driven since the memory was last cleared.
Total distance travelled - Odometer
Average speed - Value constantly recalculated, for distance since last clearing
the memory. After erasing the memory, no data will appear for the first 300 m
driven.
Current Speed - Digital speedometer.
Coolant temperature - If the coolant temperature is in the range 70-120 °C,
the engine operating temperature has been reached. If the temperature is be-
low 70 ° C, high engine speeds and straining the engine should be avoided. If
the temperature is over 120 ° C, the warning light lights up the instrument
cluster  » page 27.
Oil temperature - if the temperature is lower than 50 °C or if there is a fault in
the system for checking the oil temperature, the  symbols are displayed.
Warning of excessive speed - It is possible to set a speed limit.

WARNING

Even at temperatures of around +4 °C, black ice may still be on the road
surface! You should therefore not only rely on the outside temperature dis-
play for accurate information as to whether there is ice on the road.

regular breaks in your journey when driving long distances, so that the body
can recuperate from the stress of the journey. Please consult your doctor,
who can evaluate your specific condition.

CAUTION

The following instructions should be observed to avoid damage to the seats.
■ Do not kneel on the seats or otherwise apply concentrated pressure to them.
■ Do not switch on the heating for unoccupied seats.
■ Do not switch on the heating for seats which have objects on them (e.g. a

Transport of cargo

Luggage compartment and transporting objects

 Introduction

When transporting heavy objects, the driving characteristics change due to
the shift in centre-of-gravity. Therefore, adjust the speed and driving mode ac-
cordingly.

When transporting cargo the following instructions must be adhered to
▶ Distribute the load evenly in the luggage compartment and secure it with

suitable lashing straps to the lashing eyes or fixing nets so that they cannot
slip.

▶ Place heavy objects as far forward in the luggage compartment as possible.
▶ Tyre pressure should be adjusted for the load.
In the event of an accident, even small and light objects gain so much kinetic
energy that they can cause severe injuries.
The magnitude of the kinetic energy is dependent on the speed at which the
vehicle is travelling and the weight of the object.

Luggage compartment light
The light switches on/off when the luggage compartment lid is opened or
closed.
If the boot lid is open and the ignition switched off, the light will go out auto-
matically after 10 minutes.

WARNING

■ Never exceed the maximum permissible load of the respective fasteners,
nets, hooks etc. If heavy objects have not been suitably secured, there is a
risk of injury!
■ An unsecured dirt or improperly attached load could slip during a sudden
manoeuvre or in an accident - danger of injury!
■ Loose cargo could hit a deployed airbag and injure occupants – danger of
death!
■ When transporting loads in the luggage compartment that has been en-
larged by folding one of the rear seats forward, care should be taken to en-
sure the safety of passengers transported on the other rear seat.

60 Using the system

CAUTION

■ Never exceed the maximum permissible load for the respective fasteners,
nets, hooks etc. - these could be damaged.
■ Please ensure that the heating elements for the rear window heater are not

WARNING

The following instructions must be observed to aid road safety when trans-
porting cargo on the roof rack.
■ Always distribute the load on the roof rack evenly and secure properly
with suitable lashing straps or tensioning straps.
■ When transporting heavy objects or objects which take up a large area on
the roof rack system, the handling of the car may change as a result of the
displacement of the centre of gravity. The style of driving and speed must
therefore be adapted to the current circumstances.
■ The permissible roof load, permissible axle loads and permissible total ve-
hicle weight must not be exceeded under any circumstances – risk of acci-
dent!

CAUTION

■ Make sure that the panoramic tilt / slide sunroof or the boot lid does not col-
lide with the roof load when opened.
■ Ensure the roof aerial is not impaired by the load being transported.

Note

We recommend that you use a roof rack from ŠKODA Original Accessories.

Heating, manual air conditioning system, Climatronic

 Introduction

The heater heats and ventilates the vehicle interior. The air conditioning sys-
tem also cools and dehumidifies the vehicle interior.
The heating effect is dependent upon the coolant temperature, thus full heat
output only occurs when the engine has reached its operating temperature.
The cooling system works under the following conditions.


The cooling system is switched on.
The engine is running.
The outside temperature is above 2 °C.
The blower is switched on.







When the cooling system is switched on, it prevents misting of the windscreen
and windows.
It is possible to boost the effectiveness of the cooling system by briefly acti-
vating the air recirculation system» page 66.

Health protection
To reduce health risks (e.g. common colds), the following instructions for the
use of the cooling system are to be observed.
▶ The difference between the outside temperature and the inside temperature

should not be greater than 5 °C.

▶ The cooling system should be turned off about 10 minutes before the end of

the journey.

▶ Once a year, a disinfection of the air conditioner is to be carried out by a spe-

cialist company.

WARNING

■ The blower should always be on to prevent the windows from misting.
Otherwise there is a risk of accident.
■ Under certain circumstances, air at a temperature of about 5 °C can flow
out of the vents when the cooling system is switched on.



Heating and ventilation

63

Note

■ The air inlet in front of the windscreen must be free of e.g. ice, snow or
leaves to ensure that the heating and cooling system operates properly.
■ After switching on the cooling Condensation from the evaporator of the air
conditioning may drip down and form a puddle below the vehicle. This is not a
leak!
■ If the coolant temperature is too high, the cooling system is switched off to
ensure that the engine cools down.

Recirculation
 Read and observe 

 on page 63 first.

Air outlet vents

The recirculation mode prevents contaminated outside air getting into the in-
terior of the vehicle. In recirculated air mode air is sucked out of the interior of
the vehicle and then fed back into the interior.
› To the turn on move the slider  D  into position  or press the button  in
Climatronic.
› To turn off move the slider  D  into position  or press the button  in Cli-
matronic.

WARNING

The recirculation system cannot be switched on for a longer period of time,
because no fresh air is fed through from the outside. “Stale air” may result
in fatigue in the driver and occupants, reduce attention levels and also
cause the windows to mist up. As soon as windows mist up, turn on the re-
circulation system immediately - risk of accident!

CAUTION

We recommend not smoking in the vehicle when the recirculating air opera-
tion is switched on. The smoke sucked from the interior is deposited on the
evaporator of the air conditioner. This produces a permanent odour when the
air conditioning system is operating which can only be eliminated through con-
siderable effort and expense (replacement of compressor).

 Introduction
Applies to Swing.

This chapter covers the operation of a Bluetooth® device connected to the tel-
ephone.
To pair a telephone with the device using Bluetooth®, it is necessary to pair the
two devices.
The range of the connection to the hands-free system is limited to the passen-
ger compartment.
With the device, a phone can be connected. The telephone can also be a Blue-
tooth®player at the same time.
Up to 20 external devices can be paired with the device. After reaching the
maximum number, the pairing of the next external device will replace that of
the device that has not been used for the longest period of time.
A connection with a telephone that is already paired does not require pairing. It
is enough to find the telephone that has been paired in the list of paired
phones and make the connection.
For phones with multiple SIM cards,calls can be answered using any SIM card
from the connected phone depending on the model of the connected phone.
For outgoing calls, it depends on the type of connected telephone, either only
the primary SIM card or one of the other SIM cards can be selected.
Information on the compatibility of phones can be found on the following
ŠKODAInternet sites.

http://go.skoda.eu/compatibility

Starting-off and Driving

Starting and stopping the engine

 Introduction

It is possible, with the key in the ignition, to switch the ignition off and on and
start/stop the engine.

WARNING

■ Never switch off the engine before the vehicle is stationary – risk of acci-
dent!
■ While driving with the engine stopped the ignition must always be
switched on. Otherwise, the steering may lock - danger of an accident!
■ Do not withdraw the ignition key from the ignition lock until the vehicle
has come to a stop » page 91, Parking. Otherwise, the steering may lock -
danger of an accident!
■ Never leave the vehicle unattended with the engine running - risk of acci-
dent, theft or similar.
■ Never (e.g. in garages) run the engine in a closed place - there is the dan-
ger of poisoning and death!

CAUTION

■ Only start the engine when the engine and the vehicle are stationary - there
is a danger of starter and engine damage!
■ Do not push-start the engine – risk of damaging the engine and the catalytic
converter. The battery from another vehicle can be used as a jump-start aid.

Note

Do not warm up the engine while the vehicle is stationary. If possible, start
your journey as soon as the engine has started. Through this, the engine rea-
ches its operating temperature faster.

Electronic immobiliser and steering lock
 Read and observe 

 on page 87 first.

 and 

The electronic immobiliser (hereinafter referred to as immobiliser) makes the
theft or unauthorised use of your vehicle more difficult.

Immobiliser
The immobilizer allows the engine to be started only with the original car key.

Malfunction of the immobiliser
If the immobiliser in the key fails, it is not possible to start the engine.
Use the other vehicle key to start the engine; if necessary, seek help from a
specialist garage.

Steering lock - lock
› Remove the key and turn the steering wheel until the steering lock engages.
Steering lock - unlock
› Insert the key into the ignition and turn on the ignition. If this is not possible,
then move the steering wheel slightly back and forth, as a result of which the
steering lock should unlock.

WARNING

Never let the vehicle roll with locked steering lock - danger of accident!

Starting-off and Driving

87

Do not switch the engine off immediately at the end of your journey if the en-
gine has been working at high revs over a prolonged period, but leave it to run
at an idling speed for about 1 minute. This prevents any possible accumulation
of heat when the engine is switched off.

Note

After switching off the ignition, the radiator fan may (also intermittently) con-
tinue to operate for approx. 10 minutes.

START-STOP system

 Introduction

The START-STOP system (hereinafter referred to as: the system) reduces
CO2emissions and harmful emissions, and saves fuel.
If the system determine that the engine is not needed when the vehicle stops
(e.g. at the traffic lights), it turns off the engine and starts it again when mov-
ing off.
The system function depends on many factors. Some of them are down to the
driver, the others are systemic and can neither be influenced nor identified.
Therefore the system may react differently in situations which seem identi-
cal from the driver's perspective.
The system is automatically activated every time the ignition is switched on
(even where this has previously been manually deactivated with the button
).

Note

If the engine has stopped due to the system, the ignition remains on.

The engine is not automatically switched off.



The engine does not shut down when the vehicle stops, if e.g. the following
applies.
▶ The engine temperature for the proper function of the system has not yet

been reached.

▶ The charge state of the vehicle battery is too low.

▶ The current consumption is too high.
▶ High air conditioning or heating output (high fan speed, big difference be-

tween the desired and actual interior temperature).

If the engine has shut down automatically but the system detects that the en-
gine is required to run (e.g. if the brake pedal is pressed repeatedly) then the
system automatically starts up the engine.

Note

■ If the driver's seat belt is removed for more than 30 seconds or the driver's
door is opened after the engine has switched off automatically, the engine will
have to be restarted manually.
■ No automatic engine shut-down takes place when a vehicle with automatic
transmission is moving at low speed (e.g. during a traffic jam) and remains sta-
tionary after pressing the brake pedal lightly. Automatic engine shutdown
takes place if you press the brake pedal down with more force.
■ For vehicles with automatic transmission there is no automatic engine shut-
down when the system detects a manoeuvring action due to a large steering
angle.

Brakes and Parking

 Introduction

.

.

The wear and tear on the brake pads is dependent on the operating conditions
and driving style. In difficult conditions (e.g. urban, sporty driving), the condi-
tion of the brakes should be checked between services by a specialist garage.
Brake response can be slower if the brakes are covered in moisture or, in
winter, have a layer of ice or salt on them. The brakes should be cleaned and
dried by applying the brakes many times over » 
Corrosion on the brake discs and dirt on the brake pads can occur if the vehi-
cle has been parked for a long period and if you do not make much use of the
braking system. The brakes are cleaned by applying the brakes several times
over » 
Before negotiating a long or steep gradient, reduce speed and shift down a
gear. As a result, the braking effect of the engine will be used, reducing the
load on the brakes. If, nevertheless, there is a need for additional braking, it
should be carried out at intervals.
Emergency braking warning - If it is necessary to brake hard, the system may
cause the brake lights to automatically flash, to alert the traffic behind.
New brake pads must first be ““run in”” because these do not initially have the
best possible braking effect. Drive especially carefully for the first 200 km or
so.
If the brake fluid level is too low, it can cause faults in the braking system;
the warning light will light up in the instrument cluster  » page 26,  Braking
system. If the warning light does not light up, yet the stopping distance is per-
ceived to be longer than before, the driving style should be adapted in view of
the unknown cause of the problem, and braking kept to a minimum - seek the
help of a specialist garage without delay.
The brake booster increases the pressure generated with the brake pedal. The
brake booster only operates when the engine is running.

WARNING

■ Greater physical effort is required for braking when the engine is switch-
ed off – risk of accident!
■ When braking in a vehicle with manual transmission, when the vehicle is in
gear and at low revs, the clutch pedal must be depressed. Otherwise, the
functionality of the brake system may be impaired – risk of accident!
■ Do not depress the brake pedal, if there is no requirement to slow down.
This causes the brakes to overheat and can also result in a longer braking
distance and excessive wear - risk of accident!
■ Only brake for the purpose of drying and cleaning the brake discs if the
traffic conditions permit this. Do not place any other road users in jeopardy.
■ Recommendations for new brake pads should be followed.
■ When stopping and parking, the parking brake should always be applied
firmly, otherwise the vehicle could move off - risk of accident!
■ If a front spoiler, full wheel trim, etc. is mounted retrospectively, it must
be ensured that the air supply to the front wheel brakes is not reduced.
Otherwise, the front brakes could be in danger of overheating – risk of ac-
cident!

Handbrake

Fig. 123

button » Fig. 123 .
› Move the lever right down while pressing the lock button.
The handbrake warning light  lights up when the handbrake is applied, provi-
ded the ignition is on.
A warning signal sounds if the vehicle is inadvertently driven off with the hand-
brake applied. The handbrake warning is activated if the vehicle is driven at a
speed of over 5 km/h for more than 3 seconds.

WARNING

Disengage the handbrake completely. A handbrake which is only partially
disengaged can result in the rear brakes overheating. This can have a nega-
tive effect on the operation of the brake system – risk of accident!

Parking
 Read and observe 

 on page 90 first.

When stopping and parking, look for a place with a suitable surface » 
Only carry out the activities while parking in the specified order.
› Bring the vehicle to a stop and depress the brake pedal.
› Firmly apply the handbrake.
› For vehicles with automated gearbox shift the lever to position D or R.
› Switch off the engine.
› For vehicles with manual transmission, select 1st gear or Reverse gear R.
› Release the brake pedal.

 .

WARNING

■ The parts of the exhaust system can become very hot. Therefore, never
stop the vehicle in places where the underside of your vehicle could come
into contact with flammable materials (e.g. dry grass, leaves, spilled fuel or
the like). - Risk of fire and serious injury can occur!
■ When leaving the vehicle never leave people unattended in the car who
could, for example, lock the vehicle or release the brake - risk of accidents
and injury!

Tips on economical driving

Fuel consumption depends on the driving style, road and weather conditions,
and similar such factors.
For an economical driving style, the following instructions must be observed.
▶ Avoid unnecessary acceleration and braking.
▶ Engage the recommended gear » page 32.
▶ Avoid full throttle and high speeds.
▶ Reduce idling.
▶ Avoid short distances.
▶ Ensure the correct tyre inflation pressure is maintained » page 118.
▶ Avoid unnecessary ballast.
▶ Remove the roof rack before driving if it is not needed.
▶ Only turn on electrical consumers (e.g. seat heating) for as long as necessary.
▶ Briefly ventilate before turning on the cooling system, do not use the cooling

system with the windows open.

▶ Do not leave windows open at high speeds.

Avoiding damage to your vehicle

Driving Tips

Only drive on roads and terrain that are appropriate to the vehicle parameters
» page 141, Technical data.
The driver is always responsible for deciding whether the vehicle can cope
with the conditions and the terrain.

WARNING

■ Always adjust the speed and driving style to the visibility, weather, road
and traffic conditions applying at the time. Too high a speed or an errone-
ous manoeuvre may cause serious injury and damage to the vehicle.
■ Combustible objects such as dry leaves or twigs caught under the base of
the vehicle could ignite on hot vehicle parts - risk of fire!

94

Driving

CAUTION

■ Pay attention to the ground clearance of the vehicle! When driving over ob-
jects which are larger than the ground clearance, the vehicle can get damaged.
■ Any objects that get trapped under the vehicle floor must be removed as
soon as possible. These items can cause damage to the vehicle (e.g. to parts of
the fuel or brake system).

Driving through water

Fig. 127 
Maximum permissible water lev-
el when driving through water

The following instructions must be observed if vehicle damage is to be avoided
when driving through water (e.g. flooded roads).
› Therefore determine the depth of the water before driving through bodies of
water. The water level must not go above the web of the lower beam
» Fig. 127.
› Drive at no more than walking pace, otherwise a wave may form in front of
the vehicle, which could cause the water to enter into the vehicle’s systems
(e.g. the air intake system for the engine).
› Never stop in the water, do not reverse and do not switch the engine off.

CAUTION

■ If water gets into the vehicle’s systems (e.g. the air intake system for the en-
gine) it can cause serious damage to the vehicle!
■ Oncoming vehicles can generate water waves which can exceed the permis-
sible water level for your vehicle.
■ Do not drive through salt water, as the salt can cause corrosion. An vehicle
coming into contact with salt water is to be thoroughly rinsed with fresh wa-
ter.

Assist systems

General information

 Introduction

WARNING

■ The assistance systems serve merely to support the driver and do not re-
lieve the driver of responsibility for the operation of the vehicle.
■ The increased safety as well as the increased occupant protection of-
fered by the assistance systems must not tempt you to take safety risks -
there is a risk of an accident!
■ Adjust the speed and driving style to the current visibility, weather, road
and traffic conditions.
■ The assistance systems have physical and system-related limitations. For
this reason, the driver may experience some undesired or delayed system
responses in certain situations. You should therefore always be alert and
ready to intervene!
■ Only activate, deactivate and set the assistance systems to keep you fully
in control of the vehicle in every traffic situation - otherwise there is a risk
of an accident!

Braking and stabilisation systems

 Introduction

The brake and stabilisation systems are automatically activated each time the
ignition is switched on, unless otherwise indicated.
The error display is in Chapter » page 25, Warning lights.

Stability Control (ESC)
 Read and observe 

 on page 95 first.

ESC improves vehicle stability in critical driving situations (e.g. if the vehicle
starts to skid) by braking the individual wheels to maintain the driving direc-
tion.
If there is a TCS intervention, the indicator light  flashes in the instrument
cluster.

Anti-lock braking system (ABS)
 Read and observe 

 on page 95 first.

ABS prevents the wheels locking when braking. Thus helping the driver to
maintain control of the vehicle.
An ABS intervention can be noticed through pulsating movements of the
brake pedal and distinct noises.
When the ABS system is active, do not brake periodically or reduce the pres-
sure on the brake pedal.

Engine drag torque control (MSR)
 Read and observe 

 on page 95 first.

MSR counteracts the tendency of the drive wheels to lock during downshifts
or sudden deceleration (e.g. on icy or an otherwise slippery road surface).
If the drive wheels should lock, then the engine speed is automatically in-
creased. This reduces the braking effect of the engine and the wheels can ro-
tate freely again.

WARNING

The general information relating to the use of assistance systems must be
observed » page 95, 

 in section Introduction.

Traction control (TCS)
 Read and observe 

 on page 95 first.

TCS prevents the spinning of the wheels on the drive axle. TCS reduces the
drive power transmitted to the wheels that are spinning. Thus, for example,
driving on road surfaces with low grip is made easier.
If there is a TCS intervention, the warning light  flashes in the instrument
cluster.

Assist systems

95

Electronic Differential Lock (EDL)
 Read and observe 

 on page 95 first.

Parking aid (ParkPilot)

 Introduction

EDL prevents the turning of the respective wheel of the driven axle. EDL
brakes a spinning wheel if required and transfers the drive power force to the
other drive wheel. Driving becomes easier on road surfaces with different
traction under each wheel of the driven axle.
The EDL switches off automatically in order to avoid excessive heat generation
on the brake of the wheel being braked. Once the brakes have cooled down,
there is an automatic re-activation of EDL.

Brake Assist (HBA)
 Read and observe 

 on page 95 first.

HBA increases the braking effect and helps to shorten the braking distance.
The HBA is activated by very quick operation of the brake pedal. In order to
achieve the shortest possible braking distance, the brake pedal must be ap-
plied firmly until the vehicle has come to a standstill.
The HBA function is automatically switched off when the brake pedal is re-
leased.

Hill Start Assist
 Read and observe 

 on page 95 first.

When driving on slopes, Hill Start Assist (hereinafter referred to simply as the
system) allows you to move your foot from the brake pedal to the accelerator
pedal without the vehicle rolling downhill on its own.
The vehicle is braked by the system for about 2 seconds after releasing the
brake pedal.
The system is active as of a 5% slope, if the driver door is closed. The system is
only ever active on slopes when starting off in forward or reverse.

The parking aid (hereinafter referred to simply as the system) uses acoustic
signals and an indication in the Swing radio display to draw your attention to
obstacles in the vicinity of the vehicle when manoeuvring.

WARNING

 in section Introduction.

■ The general information relating to the use of assistance systems must be
observed » page 95, 
■ Moving persons or objects may not be recognized by the system sensors.
■ Under certain circumstances, surfaces of certain objects and types of
clothing cannot reflect the system signals. There is a danger that such ob-
jects or people may not be recognised by the system sensors.
■ External noise sources may affect the signals of the system sensors.
There is a danger that obstacles may not be recognised by the system sen-
sors.
■ Before manoeuvring, ensure that there are no small obstacles - such as
rocks, narrow posts or similar - behind your vehicle. Such obstacles may
not be recognised by the system sensors.

CAUTION

■ Keep the system sensors » Fig. 128 on page 97 clean and free from snow
and ice, and do not cover them with any objects of any kind, otherwise the
functioning of the system may be restricted.
■ In adverse weather conditions (heavy rain, water vapour, very low or high
temperatures, etc.), the functioning of the system may be impaired - “incorrect
recognition of obstacles”.
■ Accessories additionally installed on the vehicle rear, such as bicycle carriers,
can impair the system function.

City Safe Drive

 Introduction

City Safe Drive (hereinafter referred to as: the system) monitors the traffic sit-
uation ahead of the vehicle. If the system detects a risk of collision with an ob-
stacle ahead of the vehicle, then automatic braking is applied. The risk of a col-
lision is thus reduced and the consequences of an impact are minimized.

WARNING

■ The general information relating to the use of assistance systems must be
observed » page 95, 
■ The system does not respond to crossing or oncoming objects.

Component protection
 Read and observe 

 on page 102 first.

Some electronic vehicle components (such as the instrument cluster) are fac-
tory-equipped with component protection. This ensures the functional limita-
tion of these components in a non-legitimate installation in another vehicle
(e.g. after a theft) or operation outside the vehicle.

■ Modifications, repairs and technical alterations that have been carried out
unprofessionally can cause damage and operational faults, and can also se-
riously impair the effectiveness of the airbag system – risk of accident and
fatal injury!
■ A change to the vehicle's wheel suspension, including the use of non-ap-
proved wheels and tire combinations, can impair the functioning of the air-
bag system - risk of accident and fatal injury!

WARNING

■ No changes may be made to airbag system components, the front bump-
er and the bodywork.
■ Any work on the airbag system including the installation and removal of
system components due to other repair work (e.g. removal of the steering
wheel) must only be carried out by a specialist garage.
■ Do not manipulate individual parts of the airbag system, as this might re-
sult in the airbag being deployed.
■ If the airbag has been deployed, the airbag system must be replaced.

WARNING

The airbag system operates using pressure sensors located in the front
doors. For this reason, no adjustments may be carried out to the doors or
door panels (e.g. installation of additional loudspeakers). Resulting damage
can impair the functioning of the airbag system - risk of accidents and fatal
injuries! The following guidelines must therefore be observed.
■ Any work on the front doors and their door panels must be carried out by

Cleaning and care

 Introduction

Regular and thorough care helps to retain the value of your vehicle.
The instructions for use on the packaging must be observed when using care
products. We recommend that you use ŠKODA Original Accessories care
products.

WARNING

■ Vehicle care products may be harmful to your health if not used according
to the instructions.
■ Always keep the vehicle care products safe from people who are not
completely independent, e.g. children - danger of poisoning!

CAUTION

■ Do not use any insect sponges, rough kitchen sponges or similar cleaning
products – risk of damaging the paintwork surface.
■ Do not use aggressive cleaning agents or chemical solvents - danger of dam-
aging the surface to be cleaned.

Note

We recommend that the vehicle is cleaned and maintained at a ŠKODA service
partner.

The best way to protect your vehicle against harmful environmental influences
is frequent washing.
The longer insect residues, bird droppings, road salt and other aggressive de-
posits remain on the paintwork of your vehicle, the more detrimental their de-
structive effect can be. High temperatures, such as those caused by intensive
sun's rays, accentuate this caustic effect.
It is also essential to thoroughly clean the underside of the vehicle at the end
of the winter.

Washing by hand
Wash the vehicle from top to bottom, with a soft sponge or a wash mitt and
plenty of water, and, if necessary, with the appropriate detergents. Wash out
the sponge or washing glove thoroughly at short intervals.
For wheels, door sills and lower areas of the vehicle use a different sponge.
Give the vehicle a good rinse after washing it and dry it off using a chamois
leather.

Automatic Car Washes
The usual precautionary measures must be taken before washing the vehicle
(e.g. closing the windows and the tilt/slide roof etc.).
If your vehicle is fitted with any particular attached parts (e.g. spoiler, roof rack
system, two-way radio aerial etc.) it is best to consult the operator of the car
wash system beforehand.
After an automatic wash with wax treatment, the wiper blades should be
cleaned with cleaning agents specially designed for the purpose, and then de-
greased.

Pressure Washers
When washing the vehicle with a high-pressure cleaner, the instructions for
use of the equipment must be observed. This particularly applies to instruc-
tions regarding the pressure and spraying distance from the vehicle surface. 

Protection of cavities
All the cavities of your vehicle which are at risk from corrosion are protected
by a layer of long-lasting protective wax applied in the factory.



Care and maintenance

105

If any small amount of wax flow out of the cavities at high temperatures, these
must be removed with a plastic scraper and the stains cleaned using a petrole-
um cleaner.

Underbody
The underside of your vehicle is already permanently protected by the factory
against chemical and mechanical influences.
We recommend having the protective coating — preferably before the begin-
ning of winter and at the end of winter.

Product life of the films
Environmental influences (eg. sunlight, humidity, air pollution, chipping) will af-
fect the life of the films. Films will age and become brittle - this is entirely nor-
mal; this is not a fault.
The sunlight may also affect the strength of the film colour.
When transporting a load on the roof rack (e.g. roof box or similar) there is an
increased risk of film damage (e.g. of chipping from the secured load).

CAUTION
■ Vehicle paint

■ Repair damaged areas as soon as possible.
■ Matt-painted parts should not be treated with polishes or hard waxes.
■ Do not polish in a dusty environment - risk of paint scratches.
■ Do not apply any paint care products to door seals or window guides.

■ Plastic parts

■ Do not use paint polish.

■ Chromed and anodised parts

■ Films

■ Do not polish in a dusty environment - risk of surface scratches.

The following instructions must be observed, otherwise there is a risk of film
damage.
■ Do not use dirty cloths or sponges for cleaning.
■ Do not use a scraper or other means to remove ice and snow.
■ Do not polish the films
■ Do not use a high pressure cleaner on the films.

■ Rubber seals

■ Do not treat the door seals and window guides deal with anything - the
protective varnish coating could be damaged.

106 General Maintenance

■ Windows and door mirrors

■ Do not clean the inside of the windows with sharp objects - there is a risk
of damage to the filaments.
■ Do not use a cloth which has been used to polish the body - this could dirty
the window and impair visibility.

■ Head / tail lights

■ Do not wipe head/tail lamps dry, do not use any sharp objects - risk of dam-
age to the protective coating and cracks forming on the headlamp glass cov-
ers.

■ Door lock cylinders

■ Make sure that as little water as possible gets into the locking cylinder
when washing the vehicle - there is a risk of freezing the lock cylinder!

■ Wheels

■ Heavy soiling of the wheels can affect the balance of the wheels - the re-
sult can be a vibration, which can cause premature wear of the steering.

Unleaded petrol
 Read and observe 

 and 

 on page 108 first.

The correct fuel for the vehicle is specified on the inside of the fuel filler flap
» Fig. 134 on page 108.



The vehicle can only be operated with unleaded petrol containing a maximum
of 10% bioethanol (E10).
Unleaded petrol must meet European standard EN 228 (in Germany DIN
51626-1 or E10 for unleaded petrol with octane numbers 95 and 91).

Specified petrol is 95 RON / ROZ
Use min. 95 RON petrol.
In an emergency, 91. 92 or93 ROZ petrol can be used (slight loss of power,
slightly increased fuel consumption) » 

.

CAUTION

The following instructions must be observed, otherwise there is a risk of dam-
age to the engine and to the exhaust system.
■ When petrol with a lower than the prescribed octane is used, only continue
driving at mid-range engine speeds and with minimal strain on the engine. Re-
fuel using petrol of the prescribed octane number as soon as possible.
■ Lower than 91 octane petrol should not be used, even in an emergency!
■ If a fuel other than unleaded fuel which complies to the above mentioned
standards (e.g. leaded petrol) is put in the tank by mistake, do not start the en-
gine or switch on the ignition.

CAUTION

Petrol additives (additives)
■ Unleaded petrol in accordance with the prescribed standards meets all the
conditions for a smooth running engine. We therefore do not recommend mix-
ing fuel additives into the petrol - risk of engine damage or damage to the ex-
haust system.
■ The following additives may not be used - risk of engine damage or dam-
age to the exhaust system!

■ Additives with metal components (metallic additives), in particular with
manganese and iron content.
■ Fuels with metallic content (e.g. LRP - lead replacement petrol).

Note

■ Unleaded petrol that has a higher octane number than that required by the
engine can be used without limitations.
■ On vehicles using the prescribed unleaded petrol of min. 95 RON, the use of
petrol with a higher octane number than 95 RON can lead to an increase in
power and reduction in fuel consumption.

Refuelling with CNG (compressed natural gas)

Fig. 136  Natural gas filler tubes

 Read and observe 

 and 

 on page 108 first.

Natural gas refuelling may vary from station to station. When refuelling with
natural gas at a station unfamiliar to you, you should get someone to instruct
you or allow the fuelling operation carried out by the station staff.

Refuelling operation
› Switch off the ignition.
› Open the fuel filler flap.
› Remove cap  A  » Fig. 136 in the direction of the arrow and insert connector
for the refuelling system into filler neck  B .

The fuel tank is full when the compressor of the refuelling system automatical-
ly switches off.
› Check that sealing ring  C  » Fig. 136 has remained inserted in filler neck  B . If
the sealing ring has slipped on the connector, reinsert it into the filler neck.
› Insert cap  A  into the filler neck and close the fuel filler flap until it locks into
place.

The natural gas refuelling systems have an overfill protection relating to the
outdoor temperature. At very high outside temperatures, it may happen that
the gas tank may not be fully refuelled.
If the car is parked directly after a refuelling operation, on restart the pointer
of the gas gauge may not show exactly the same level as immediately after the
filling process. This is not a leak in the system, but a reduction in pressure due
to the cooling of the gas in the gas tank after refuelling.
The maximum lifetime of the gas tank is 20 years.



Inspecting and replenishing

109

The capacity of the natural gas fuel tank is about 11 kg, of which about 1.5 kg
are in the reserve tank.
The capacity of the petrol fuel tank is approximately 10 litres, of which about 5
litres is in the reserve tank.

WARNING

■ Natural gas is highly explosive and highly flammable.
■ When refuelling, never get into the vehicle. If you have to get into your
vehicle in exceptional cases, touch a metal surface before you touch the fill-
ing coupling again. Otherwise, electrostatic discharging may occur - risk of
fire!

CAUTION

LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) and hythane (mix-
ture of hydrogen and methane) must not be used - there is a risk of damaging
the engine and the exhaust system.

Note

During the filling process sounds are heard which are harmless. If you are un-
sure which service station staff to use, ask the petrol station staff.

Wheels

Wheels and tyres

Advice on tyre/wheel usage

During the first 500 km, new tyres do not offer optimum grip; appropriate
care should therefore be taken when driving.
Tyres with the deeper profiles should always be fitted to the front wheels.
Rims and wheel bolts are matched to each other in terms of design. We rec-
ommend that you use rims and wheel bolts from ŠKODA Original Accessories.
Wheels and tyres should always be stored in a cool, dry and dark place. The
tyres themselves should be stored vertically.

Tyre life
Tyres age and lose their original characteristics, even if they are not being
used. Do not use tyres that are older than 6 years.
The manufacturing date is indicated on the tyre sidewall (possibly on the in-
side). E.g. DOT ... 10 17... means that the tyres were manufactured in the 10th
week of the year 2017.

Tyre damage
We recommend checking your tyres and wheel rims for damage (punctures,
cuts, splits and bulges etc.) on a regular basis.
Remove any foreign objects in the tyre’s profile immediately (e.g. small
stones).
Foreign bodies which have penetrated into the tyre (e.g. screws or nails)
should not be removed and help should be sought from a specialist garage.

Fitting new tyres
Only fit approved radial tyres of the same type, size (rolling circumference) and
the same tread pattern on one axle on all four wheels.
When mounting new tires the tires have to be replaced axle by axle.

Unidirectional tyres
The direction of rotation of the tyres is marked by arrows on the wall of the
tyre.

118 General Maintenance

The specified running direction must be strictly adhered to, otherwise the fol-
lowing tyre characteristics may be degraded.
▶ Driving stability.
▶ Traction.
▶ Tyre noise and tyre wear.

WARNING

Never use damaged tyres or tyres that are older than 6 years, go - risk of
accident.

CAUTION

■ The tyres must be protected from contact with substances (e.g. oil, grease
and fuel) which could damage them. If the tyres come into contact with these
substances, then we recommend you have this checked out in a specialist
workshop.
■ Do not use rims with ground or polished surfaces in winter conditions - there
is a risk of rim damage (e.g through salt spreading).

The approved tyre sizes for your vehicle are listed in the vehicle's technical
documentation and in the declaration of conformity (the so-called COC docu-
ment).

Tyre wear and wheel change

Check tyre pressures
Check the tyre pressure, including that of the spare wheel, at least once a
month and also before setting off on a long journey.
Always check the inflation pressure when the tyres are cold. Do not reduce
the higher pressure on warm tyres.
In vehicles with tyre pressure monitoring, tyre pressure values must be saved
each time the pressures are changed » page 100.

WARNING

■ Do not drive with incorrect tyre pressure - risk of accident.
■ In the event of very rapid pressure loss (e.g. in the event of tyre damage)
an attempt should be made to bring the vehicle carefully to a stop without
sudden steering movements and without any hard braking - risk of acci-
dent.

Note

The declaration of conformity (the so-called COC document), can be obtained
from a ŠKODA1) partner.

Fig. 146  Tyre wear indicator / wheel change

Tyre wear increases in the following circumstances.
▶ Incorrect tyre pressures.
▶ Driving style (e.g. fast cornering, rapid acceleration / braking).
▶ Incorrect wheel balancing (you should have the wheels balanced after chang-

ing/repair tyres or if the steering “is drifting”).

▶ Wheel alignment errors.
There are wear indicator markersin the tyre profiles, indicating whether the
minimum permissible tread depth has been reached » Fig. 146 - . A tyre
should be regarded as worn out when this indicator is flush with the tread.
Markings on the walls of the tyres with the letters “TWI” or other symbols (e.g.
), identify the position of the wear indicators.
To ensure uniform wear on all tyres, we recommend that you change the
wheels every 10 000 km, in line with the schedule » Fig. 146 - .

WARNING

■ Change the tyres at the latest when they are worn down to the wear indi-
cators - risk of accident.
■ Faulty wheel alignment affects handling - risk of accident.
■ Unusual vibrations or the vehicle “pulling ” to one side could be a sign of
tyre damage. Reduce speed and stop! If there are no external signs of tyre
damage, seek the help of a specialist garage.

WARNING

Changing a wheel

Preliminary work

For safety's sake, the following instructions must be observed before
changing a wheel on the road.
› As far as possible park the vehicle as far as possible away from the traffic
flow - choose a place with a flat and firm surface.
› Switch off the engine.
› For vehicles with manual transmission select 1st gear.
› For vehicles with automated transmission shift the lever to position D or R.
› Firmly apply the handbrake.
› Switch on the hazard warning lights and set up the warning triangle at the
prescribed distance.
› Have all the occupants get out. The passengers should not stand on the
road while the wheel is being changed (they should remain behind a crash
barrier, for instance).

.

Changing a wheel
› Remove the spare wheel » page 124.
› Remove the full wheel trim » page 124 or caps » page 124.
› Loosen the wheel bolts » page 125 » 
› Jack up the vehicle until the wheel that needs changing, is clear of the
ground » page 125.
› Unscrew the wheel bolts and place them on a clean surface (cloth, paper,
etc.).
› Remove the wheel carefully.
› Attach the spare wheel and slightly screw on the wheel bolts.
› Lower the vehicle.
› Tighten the wheel bolts opposite each other using the wheel wrench (“pull-
ing crossways”) » page 125.
› Replace the wheel trim » page 124 and caps » page 124.

■ Undo the wheel bolts just a little (about one turn), provided the vehicle
has not yet been jacked up. Otherwise the wheel could come loose and fall
off – risk of injury.
■ Under no circumstances must the bolts be greased or oiled - cause an ac-
cident.

Subsequent steps

After changing the wheel, the following work must be carried out.
› Stow the replaced wheel in the well under the floor covering of the luggage
compartment and secure with a locking screw.
› Stow the tool kit in the space provided and secure using the band.
› Check tyre pressure on the mounted wheel and adjust if necessary and, with
vehicles with tyre pressure monitoring, save the tyre pressure values in the
system » page 100.
› Have the tightening torque of the wheel bolts checked as soon as possible.
The prescribed tightening torque is 110 Nm.

Replace the damaged tyre. Repairing the tyre is not recommended.

WARNING

Tightening torque which is too high can damage the threads and this can
result in permanent deformation of the contact surfaces on the rim. Where
tightening torque is too low, the wheels may become loose while driving -
risk of accident. Therefore drive cautiously and only at a moderate speed
until the tightening torque has been checked.

Emergency equipment and self-help

127

WARNING

■ If the tyre does not inflate to at least. 2.0 bar, the damage is too great.
The sealing agent cannot be used to seal the tyre.  Stop driving! Seek
help from a specialist garage.
■ The tyre inflation hose and air compressor may get hot as the tyre is be-
ing inflated – risk of burning.

CAUTION

Switch off the air compressor at the latest after the running time according to

Jump-starting

 Introduction

WARNING

■ The following instructions must be followed at all times when working on
the engine compartment » page 111.
■ When handling the vehicle battery, the following warnings must be ob-
served » page 115.
■ A discharged vehicle battery may already freeze at temperatures just be-
low 0 °C. If the battery is frozen, do not carry out a jump start with the bat-
tery of another vehicle – risk of explosion and injury!
■ Never jump-start vehicle batteries with an electrolyte level that is too low
– risk of explosion and caustic burns.

Jump-starting using the battery from another vehicle

Fig. 157  Jump-starting:  - discharged battery,  - power-supplying
battery / ground point of the engine for the START-STOP system

 Read and observe 

 on page 128 first.

If, because of a discharged battery, it is not possible to start the engine, the
battery of another vehicle can be used to start the engine. To do this, jump-
start cables are required which have a sufficiently large cross-section and insu-
lated terminal clamps.
The rated voltage of the two batteries must be 12 V. The capacity (Ah) of the
power-supplying battery must not be significantly lower than the capacity of
the discharged battery.



The jump-start cables must be attached in the following sequence.
› Attach clamp  1  to the positive terminal of the discharged battery.
› Attach clamp  2  to the positive terminal of the power-supplying battery.
› Attach clamp  3  to the negative terminal of the power-supplying battery.
› For vehicles with the START-STOPsystem, attach clamp  4  to the ground
point of the engine  A » Fig. 157.
› For vehicles without the START-STOPsystem, attach clamp  4  to a solid
metal part firmly attached to the engine block or directly to the engine block.

Starting engine
› Start the engine on the vehicle providing the power and allow it to idle.
› Initiate the starting process in the vehicle with the discharged battery.
› If the engine does not start within 10 s, then cancel the starting procedure
and repeat after half a minute.
› Remove the jump start cables in the reverse order as attachment.

WARNING

■ Never clamp the jump cable to the negative terminal of the discharged
battery - risk of explosion.
■ The non-insulated parts of the terminal clamps must never touch each
other – there is a risk of short circuit.
■ The jump-start cable connected to the positive terminal of the battery
must not come into contact with electrically conducting parts of the vehi-

Towing the vehicle

Information about the towing process

Fig. 158  Braided tow rope / Spiral tow rope

.

To tow with a tow rope, only use a braided synthetic fibre rope » Fig. 158 - 
» 
Attach the tow rope or the tow bar only to the towing eye at the front
» page 130.
Conditions for towing.


Vehicles with automated manual transmission cannot be towed with
the rear wheels raised - risk of gearbox damage!
If the gearbox has no oil, your vehicle must be towed with the front axle
raised clear of the ground or on a breakdown vehicle or trailer.
The maximum towing speed is 50 km/h.
The vehicle must be transported on a special breakdown vehicle or trailer
if it is not possible to tow in the vehicle in the way described or if the tow-
ing distance is greater than 50 km.







Driver of the towed vehicle
› If possible, the vehicle should be towed with the engine running. The brake
booster and power steering only operate if the engine is running, otherwise
much greater force has to be applied to the brake pedal and more power has
to be expended for steering.
› If it is not possible to start the engine, switch on the ignition so that the
steering wheel does not lock and so that the turn signal lights, windscreen
wipers and windscreen washer system can be used.
› Take the vehicle out of gear or move the selector lever into position N if the
vehicle is fitted with an automated transmission.

Bulbs

 Introduction

We recommend having bulbs replaced by a specialist garage or seeking other
expert help in the event of any uncertainties.
▶ Switch off the ignition and all of the lights before replacing a bulb.
▶ Faulty bulbs must only be replaced with the same type of bulbs. The designa-

tion is located on the light socket or the glass bulb.

We recommend having the headlight settings checked by a specialist garage
after replacing a bulb in the low or high beam unit or the fog lamp.
Visit a specialist garage if an LED diode is faulty.

WARNING

■ Always read and observe the warnings before completing any work in the
engine compartment » page 111.
■ Accidents can be caused if the road in front of the vehicle is not suffi-
ciently illuminated and the vehicle cannot or can only be seen with difficulty
by other road users.
■ Bulbs H4, H7 and H8 are pressurised and may burst when changed - there
is a risk of injury! We therefore recommended wearing gloves and safety
glasses when changing a bulb.

CAUTION

Do not take hold of the glass bulb with naked fingers (even the smallest
amount of dirt reduces the working life of the light bulb). Use a clean cloth,
napkin, or similar.



Note

■ This Owner's Manual only describes the replacement of bulbs where it is
possible to replace the bulbs on your own without any complications arising.
Other bulbs must be replaced by a specialist garage.
■ We recommend that a box of replacement bulbs always be carried in the ve-
hicle.

ECE Regulations and EU Directives

The data on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions were not available at the
time of going to press.
The data on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are given on the ŠKODA
websites or in the sales and technical vehicle documentation.
The measurement of the intra-urban cycle begins with a cold start of the en-
gine. Afterwards urban driving is simulated.
In the extra-urban driving cycle, the vehicle is accelerated and decelerated in
all gears, corresponding to daily routine driving conditions. The driving speed
varies between 0 and 120 km/h.
