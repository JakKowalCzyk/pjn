ON CONSTANTLY: Low engine oil pressure (red)
FLASHING: Exhausted engine oil (diesel versions
with DPF only - red)

When the ignition key is turned to MAR, the warning light
switches on, but it should go out as soon as the engine is started.
1. Low engine oil pressure
The warning light turns on constantly along with a message on the
display (for versions/markets where provided) when the system
detects that engine oil pressure is low.

If the warning light v turns on when the car is
travelling (on some versions, together with the
message on the display), stop the car immediate-

ly and contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services.

After the initial warning, each time the engine is started up, the
warning light will continue to flash in the same ways as described
above, until the oil is changed. A specific message will appear on
the display (for versions/markets where provided) in addition to
the warning light.
Flashing of the warning light is not a fault but indicates that the
oil needs to be changed as a consequence of normal use.
Note that engine oil degrades faster under the following circum-
stances:
❍ mainly urban use of the car , requiring more frequent regen-

eration of the DPF;

❍ use of the car for short drives, in which the engine does not

have time to reach its regular operating temperature

❍ repeated interruptions to the regeneration process signalled by

the DPF warning light coming on.

2. Exhausted engine oil (diesel versions with DPF only)
The warning light comes on flashing and a specific message will
appear on the display (for versions/markets where provided). The
warning light may flash in the following ways, depending on the
versions:
❍ for 1 minute every two hours;
❍ for three minute cycles with the warning light off for intervals

of five seconds until oil is changed.

Exhausted engine oil should be replaced as soon
as possible after the warning light comes on, and
never more than 500 km after it first comes on.
Failure to comply with the instructions above may result
in severe damage to the engine and invalidate the war-
ranty. Remember that the operation of this warning light
is not related to the amount of oil in the engine. There-
fore, do not simply top up when the light starts flashing.

Hot engine coolant (red)
When the ignition key is turned to MAR, the warning
light turns on but should go off after a few seconds.
The warning light turns on when the engine is over-

heated. A specific message will be shown on the display.
If the warning light comes on, proceed as follows:
❍ when driving normally: stop the car, switch off the engine and
check that the water level in the reservoir is not below the MIN
mark. If it is not, wait for a few minutes for the engine to cool
down then slowly and carefully open the cap, top-up with coolant
and check that the level is between the MIN and MAX marks.
Also visually check for leaks. If the warning light comes on again
at the next engine start-up, contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Ser-
vices.

❍ if the car is used under demanding conditions (e.g. towing trail-
ers uphill or fully loaded): slow down and, if the light stays on,
stop the car. Stop for two or three minutes with the engine run-
ning and slightly accelerated to assist better coolant circulation.
Then switch the engine off. Check correct fluid level as described
above.

IMPORTANT On particularly demanding journeys, it is advisable to
keep the engine on and slightly accelerated for a few minutes be-
fore switching it off.

´

Door open (red)
(for versions/markets, where provided)
The warning light (or symbol on the display) comes
on when one or more doors or the boot are not perfectly
closed. An acoustic signal is activated with the doors open and
the car moving. On some versions, the warning light (or symbol
on the display) also lights up when the bonnet is not perfectly
closed.

U

EOBD/injection system fault (amber)

Under normal conditions, the warning light comes on
when the ignition key is turned to MAR, but should

go off as soon as the engine is started.

If the warning light remains on or comes on whilst driving, that
means that the injection system is not working properly; in partic-
ular, if the warning light comes on constantly, this indicates a mal-
function in the supply/ignition system that could cause excessive
exhaust emissions, a possible loss of performance, poor driveabil-
ity and high fuel consumption.
A specific message is displayed on certain versions.
Under these conditions, you can continue travelling at moderate
speed without demanding excessive effort from the engine. Pro-
longed use of the car with the warning light on may cause dam-
age. Contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services as soon as possible.
The warning light goes out after the fault disappears, but the in-
dication is stored in the system.

NOTE (petrol engines only)

If the warning light is flashing, this indicates that the catalytic
converter may be damaged.
If the warning light comes on intermittently, release the accelera-
tor pedal to lower the speed of the engine until the warning light
stops flashing; continue the journey at moderate speed, trying to
avoid driving conditions that may cause further flashing and contact
an Alfa Romeo Authorised Service Provider as soon as possible.

Contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services as soon as
possible if the U warning light does not light up
or if, while travelling, the warning light comes on
either fixed or blinking (in combination with a message
on the display on some versions). The operation of the U
warning light may be checked by traffic police using ap-
propriate equipment. Follow the laws in force in the coun-
try where you are driving.

á

VDC system (amber)
(for versions/markets, where provided)
When the ignition key is turned to MAR, the warning
light turns on but should go off after a few seconds. If
the warning light does not go out, or if it remains lit up when dri-
ving, contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services. A specific message
is displayed on certain versions. The warning light will flash while
driving to indicate that the VDC system is intervening.

ASR fault
When the ignition key is turned to MAR, the warning light turns
on but should go off after a few seconds. If the warning light does
not go out, or if it remains lit up when driving, contact Alfa Romeo
Authorized Services. A specific message is displayed on certain ver-
sions. The warning light will flash while driving to indicate that
the ASR system is intervening.

Hill Holder fault
This warning light comes on, on some versions together with the

DPF (particulate trap) cleaning in
progress (diesel versions with DPF
only) (amber)

When the ignition key is turned to MAR, the warning light
turns on but should go off after a few seconds. The warning light
stays on constantly to notify the driver that the DPF system needs
to eliminate captured pollutants (particulate) by the regeneration
process.
The warning light does not come on during every DPF regenera-
tion, but only when driving conditions require notification to the dri-
ver. The warning light will go off if the car stays in motion until
regeneration has been completed.
The process normally takes about 15 minutes. Optimal conditions
for completing the process are achieved by travelling at 60 km/h
with engine revs above 2000 rpm.
Operation of this warning light does not indicate a fault and the car
does not need to be taken to a workshop. A specific message will
appear on the display when the warning light comes on (for ver-
sions/markets where provided).

Always drive at a speed appropriate to the traffic
conditions, the weather and the laws in force. The
engine may be turned off while the DPF light is on;
however, repeated interruption of the regeneration process
may result in premature degradation of the engine oil.

to go off before turning off the engine, following the in-
structions appearing above. It is not a good idea to com-
plete DPF regeneration with the vehicle stationary.

TRIP COMPUTER

GENERAL INFORMATION
The Trip Computer displays information on car operation when
the key is turned to MAR. This function is composed by separate
trips, called “Trip A” and “Trip B” which can monitor the entire mis-
sion (journey) in a reciprocally independent manner.
Both trips can be reset (start of a new journey).

“Trip B” is possible to display the figures relating to:
– Distance travelled B
– Average consumption B
– Average speed B
– Journey time B (driving time).
“Trip B” may be turned off (see “Trip B on” paragraph). “Range”
and “Instant consumption” parameters cannot be reset.

“Trip A” is used to display the figures relating to:
– Autonomy
– Distance travelled
– Average consumption
– Current consumption
– Average speed
– Travel time (driving time). With the function

SYMBOLS

ALFA ROMEO CODE SYSTEM

Some components of the car have coloured labels whose sym-
bols indicate precautions to be observed when using this compo-
nent. Under the bonnet there is also a label that summarises all
the symbols.

This is an electronic engine locking system which increases pro-
tection against attempted thefts of the car. It is automatically ac-
tivated when the ignition key is extracted.
Each key contains an electronic device which modulates the sig-
nal emitted during ignition by an antenna built into the ignition de-
vice. This signal is the ‘password’ which changes at each ignition
and which the control unit uses to recognise the key and enable
ignition.

OPERATION
The Alfa Romeo CODE system control unit sends an acknowl-
edgement code to the engine management control unit to deacti-
vate the inhibitor each time the car is started by turning the igni-
tion key to MAR.
The code is sent only if the Alfa Romeo CODE system control unit
has recognised the code transmitted from the key.
Each time the ignition key is turned to STOP, the Alfa Romeo
CODE system deactivates the functions of the engine management
control unit. Warning light Y lights up on the instrument panel
if the code is not correctly recognised during ignition.
In this case, turn the key to STOP and then to MAR; if it is still
locked, try again with the other keys that come with the car. If you
are still unable to start the engine contact Alfa Romeo Authorized
Services.

ALARM (for versions/markets, where provided)

OPERATION OF THE ALARM

The alarm intervenes in the following instances:
❍ unauthorised opening of doors/bonnet/boot (perimeter pro-

tection);

❍ unauthorised operation of ignition system (ignition key rotat-

ed to MAR);

❍ the battery cables cutting;
❍ when someone is moving inside the passenger compartment

(volumetric protection);

❍ anomalous lifting/tilting of the vehicle (for versions/markets,

where provided).

Operation of the alarm is indicated by an acoustic and visual sig-
nal (flashing of the direction indicators for several seconds). The
alarm triggering modes may vary according to the markets. There
is a maximum number of acoustic/visual cycles. When this is
reached the system returns to normal operation.
IMPORTANT The engine locking function is guaranteed by the Alfa
Romeo CODE, which is automatically activated when the ignition
key is extracted from the ignition switch.
IMPORTANT The alarm is configured to comply with the regulations
existing in different countries.

SWITCHING ON THE ALARM
With the doors and bonnet closed and the ignition key either turned
to STOP or removed, direct the key with the remote control to-
wards the car, then press and release Á button. Except specific
markets, the system produces a visual and acoustic signal and
enables door locking.
A self-diagnostic stage precedes the turning on of the alarm: In case
of faults the system will generate a further acoustic and/or visu-
al signal using the LED on the dashboard.
If after the alarm is switched on, a second acoustic signal is emit-
ted and/or the LED on the dashboard flashes, wait about 4 sec-
onds and switch off the alarm by pressing Ë button, check that the
doors, bonnet and boot are closed correctly and then reactivate the
system by pressing Á button.
If the alarm produces an acoustic signal even when the doors, bon-
net and boot are correctly closed, a fault has occurred in system
operation: in this case, go to Alfa Romeo Authorized Services.

FRONT HEAD RESTRAINTS
Head restraints are adjustable in height and they lock automati-
cally in the required position:
❍ upward adjustment: lift the head restraint until it locks
❍ downward adjustment, press the A button fig. 26 and lower

the head restraint.

Head restraints must be adjusted so that the head,
rather than the neck, rests on them. Only in this
case they can protect your head correctly.

❍ press A and B buttons fig. 26 and then remove the head re-

straints by sliding them upwards.

“Anti-Whiplash” device
The head restraints are equipped with an “Anti-Whiplash” device,
which reduces the distance between head and head restraint in the
event of a rear impact, thus mitigating the “whiplash” effect.
The head restraint may move when the backrest is pressed by
the occupant’s torso or hand: this is an effect of the system and
not a fault.

START&STOP
Manual climate control system
The system will remain set to the air flow setting made by the user
when the Start&Stop function is operated (engine off when speed
is zero). Cooling and heating in the passenger compartment is not
guaranteed in these conditions because the compressor and the
engine coolant pump are both stopped. To privilege climate con-
trol system operation, press the button on the dashboard to turn
the Start&Stop function off.
NOTA In particularly severe climate conditions it is recommended
to limit the use of the Start&Stop function to prevent the com-
pressor from continuously switching on and off, with following fa-
st window misting and accumulation of humidity with unpleasant
smells in the passenger compartment.

DESCRIPTION

The automatic dual zone climate control system regulates the tem-
perature in the passenger compartment in two areas. The system
keeps the comfort in the passenger compartment constant and
compensates for variable external conditions.
NOTE The reference temperature is 22°C for optimal comfort man-
agement.
The automatically controlled parameters and functions are:
❍ air temperature delivered to driver/front passenger vents;
❍ air distribution to driver/front passenger vents;
❍ fan speed (continuous air flow variation);
❍ switching the compressor fan on (for cooling/dehumidifying

the air);

❍ air recirculation.
All these functions can be manually adjusted by operating the sys-
tem and selecting one or more functions and modifying their pa-
rameters. Automatic control of the manually changed functions will
be suspended: the system will only override your settings for safe-
ty reasons.
Manual selections will always have higher priority over automatic
settings and will be stored until the AUTO button is pressed, except
for the cases in which the system will intervene for particular, safe-
ty-related reasons.

You can adjust one function automatically and have the automat-
ic system control all the others. The amount of air introduced into
the passenger compartment is not affected by vehicle speed; it is
electronically controlled by a fan. The air temperature is always au-
tomatically controlled according to the temperature shown on the
display (except for when the system is off or in certain conditions
when the compressor is not running).
The system can manually programme and adjuste:
❍ air temperature on driver’s/passenger’s side;
❍ fan speed (continuous variation);
❍ air distribution to 7 positions;
❍ climate control compressor enabled;
❍ fast demisting/defrosting function;
❍ air recirculation;
❍ heated rear windscreen;
❍ turning the system off.

The climate control system uses an average radi-
ating temperature sensor installed under a cover
below the inner rearview mirror. To ensure opti-
mal operation of the climate control system, do not ob-
struct the detection cone of this sensor with any object.

SWITCHING THE CLIMATE CONTROL SYSTEM ON
The system can be turned on in different ways: you are recom-
mended to press the AUTO button and turn the knobs to set the re-
quired temperatures.
In this way the system operates completely automatically to ad-
just the temperature, quantity and distribution of the air introduced
into the passenger compartment. It also manages the air recircu-
lation system and the enablement of the air conditioning com-
pressor.
During fully automatic system operation, you can change at any
time the set temperatures, air distribution and fan speed by using
the relevant buttons or knobs: the system will automatically change
its settings to adjust to the new requirements.
During fully automatic operation (AUTO), the word AUTO will dis-
appear if the air distribution and/or flow rate and/or engagement
of the compressor and/or recirculation settings are changed.
In this way the climate control system will continue to automati-
cally manage all functions except for those that have been manu-
ally adjusted. There is only one fan speed in all the areas of the
passenger compartment.

ADJUSTING THE AIR TEMPERATURE
Turn A or L knob to right or left to adjust the air temperature: A
knob for the front left-hand area, L knob for the front right-hand
area of the passenger compartment. The set temperatures are
shown on the display.
Press the MONO button to align the air temperature between the
two zones.
Turn L knob to go back to the separate management of air tem-
peratures in the two zones.
Turn the knobs fully clockwise or anti-clockwise to engage respec-
tively HI (maximum heating) or LO (maximum cooling). To de-
activate these functions, rotate the temperature knob to the de-
sired temperature.

AIR RECIRCULATION AND AQS
(Air Quality System) FUNCTION
The air recirculation is managed according to the following oper-
ating logics:
❍ automatic engagement: A word on B button on;
❍ forced engagement (air recirculation always on): LED on v

A button on and A word off;

❍ forced disengagement (air recirculation always off, air taken
from the outside): the LED on v A buttons will switch off
and the A word on B button will switch off.

Forced on/off mode can be selected by pressing button v A..
When g (E button off ) is pressed, the climate control system
automatically activates air recirculation (the LED on v A but-
ton should be on). Press v A button to turn external air recir-
culation on (LED on button lit) and vice versa.
AQS (Air Quality System) function cannot be operated when g
button is pressed (LED on button off).

Turning the AQS (Air Quality System)
function on

The AQS function automatically activates internal air recirculation
when the outside air is polluted (e.g. in traffic queues and tunnels).
IMPORTANT With the AQS function active, after the internal air
recirculation system has been running for a certain time, the cli-
mate control system enables the intake of outside air for approx-
imately 1 minute. This takes place regardless of the pollution lev-
el of the outside air.
IMPORTANT The air recirculation system makes it possible to reach
the required heating/cooling conditions faster. It is, however, in-
advisable to use it on rainy/cold days as it would considerably in-
crease the possibility of the windows misting up inside (especially
if the climate control system is off). When the outside tempera-
ture is low, recirculation is forced off (air drawn from the outside)
to prevent the windows misting up.
In automatic operation inside air recirculation will be controlled auto-
matically by the system according to outside environmental condi-
tions.

It is advisable not to use the air recirculation func-
tion when the outside temperature is low to pre-
vent the windows from rapidly misting up.

CLIMATE CONTROL SYSTEM COMPRESSOR
Press C to turn the compressor on/off (the LED on the button will
light up when the compressor is on). The system remembers that
the compressor has been switched off, even after the engine has
stopped.
When the compressor is switched off the system deactivates air re-
circulation to prevent the windows from misting up and deactivates
the AQS function. In this case, although the system is capable of
maintaining the required temperature, the AUTO LED will go out.
The temperatures will flash for a few seconds if the required tem-
perature cannot be maintained.
To restore automatic control for switching on the climate control
compressor, press C button again or press the AUTO button.
With compressor off:
❍ if the outside temperature is higher than the set one, the sys-
tem will not be able to satisfy the request. The temperature
value will then flash on the display for a few seconds;

❍ the fan speed can be manually reset.
When the compressor is on and the engine is running, manual ven-
tilation cannot drop under the maximum speed (only one LED on).
IMPORTANT With the climate control compressor off, it is not pos-
sible to admit air into the passenger compartment with a tempera-
ture below the outside temperature; moreover, under certain envi-
ronmental conditions the windows could mist up very quickly since
the air cannot be dehumidified.

RAPID WINDOW DEMISTING/DEFROSTING
(MAX-DEF function)

Press -to turn windscreen and side window demisting/defrosting
function on (LED on button lit). The climate control system carries
out the following operations:
❍ switches on the climate control compressor when climatic con-

ditions allow;

❍ turns air recirculation off;
❍ sets maximum air temperature (HI) in both zones;
❍ sets proper fan speed according to the engine coolant tem-

perature;

❍ directs air flow to the windscreen and front side windows vents;
❍ the heated rear windscreen is turned on
❍ shows fan speed (LED G lit).

IMPORTANT The MAX-DEF function will remain on for approximately
3 minutes from when the engine coolant reaches adequate tem-
perature.

The LED on the AUTO button will go out when the function is on.
With the function activated the only possible manual adjustments
are adjusting the fan speed and the turning the heated rear wind-
screen off. By pressing B, C, - or AUTO buttons, the climate
control system will turn the MAX-DEF off.

START&STOP
Automatic climate control system
The automatic climate control system manages the Start&Stop
function (engine off when speed is zero) to ensure adequate com-
fort inside the passenger compartment.
Specifically, the Start&Stop function is turned off when the weath-
er is particularly hot or cold to guarantee an adequate level of com-
fort inside the passenger compartment; therefore, the engine will
not be stopped during these transient conditions, even if the speed
is zero.
When the Start&Stop is on and the engine is off at zero speed,
the climate control system will turn the engine back on if the in-
side temperature conditions should rapidly deteriorate (or if the
user asks for maximum cooling – LO – or quick demisting –
MAX-DEF).
With the Start&Stop function on and engine off at zero speed,
air flow is reduced to the minimum to main comfort conditions in-
side the passenger compartment as long as possible when the sys-
tem is in AUTO mod (LED N on).
The climate control system attempts to manage the discomfort
caused by the engine stopping (compressor and engine coolant
pump off) but operation of the climate control system can be priv-
ileged by turning the Start&Stop off by pressing the button on
the dashboard.
NOTA In particularly severe climate conditions it is recommended
to limit the use of the Start&Stop function to prevent the com-
pressor from continuously switching on and off, with following fa-
st window misting and accumulation of humidity with unpleasant
smells in the passenger compartment.

NOTA When the Start&Stop function is active (engine off and
vehicle speed zero), the automatic recirculation management is
turned off always taking air in from outside, to reduce the proba-
bility of window misting up (as the compressor is off).

SUPPLEMENTARY ELECTRIC HEATER
(for versions/markets where provided)
This device speeds up passenger compartment warming when it is
very cold. The additional heater turns off automatically after reach-
ing the required comfort conditions.

Automatic dual zone climate control system
(for versions/markets, where provided)
The supplementary electric heater is operated automatically ac-
cording to environmental conditions and when the engine is run-
ning.

Manual climate control system
The supplementary heater is activated automatically by turning A
knob to the end of the red section and setting the fan (knob B)
to at least the 1st speed.

IMPORTANT NOTES
The heater only works if the outside temperature and engine coolant
temperature are low.
The heater will not activate if the battery voltage is too low.

erate the direction indicator stalk to select the side (right or left).

AUTOMATIC LIGHTING CONTROL (AUTOLIGHT)
(Dusk sensor) (for versions/markets, where provided)
This system consists of an infrared LED sensor combined with a rain
sensor installed on the windscreen. It can detect changes of light
intensity outside the car according to the light sensitivity setting
programmed in the set-up menu: the higher the sensitivity, the low-
er the amount of external light needed to switch the lights on.

Activation

The dusk sensor is activated by turning the A ring fig. 40 to 2A .
In this way the side lights and dipped beam headlights are both
switched on automatically according to the outside light level.

IMPORTANT The sensor is unable to detect the presence of fog. Un-
der these circumstances, these lights are therefore turned on man-
ually.

When the lights are turned on by the sensor, the fog lights (for ver-
sions/markets, where provided) and the rear fog lights may be
turned on. When the lights are automatically switched off, the front
and rear fog lights (if activated) are also switched off. The next
time the lights are switched on automatically, the fog lights must
be reactivated manually (if required).
With the sensor active, it is possible to flash the headlights but
the main beam headlights cannot be switched on. If you need to
turn these lights on, turn A ring fig. 40 to position 2 and turn
the dipped beam headlights on.
When the lights have been activated automatically and are then
switched off by the sensor, the dipped beam headlights are switched
off first, followed by the side lights a few seconds later.
If the sensor is activated but is malfunctioning, the side lights and
dipped beam headlights are switched on independently of the out-
side light level and the sensor fault is indicated on the instrument
panel display. It is also possible to deactivate the sensor and switch
on these light.

MAIN BEAM HEADLIGHTS
With A ring in position 2 pull the stalk towards the steering wheel
(stable position). The warning light 1 on the instrument panel
will come on. To turn the lights off, pull the stalk again towards
the steering wheel (dipped beam headlights will stay on). It is
not possible to switch on the main beam headlights in fixed mode
if the automatic lighting control system is active.

FLASHINGS
Pull the stalk towards the steering wheel (unstable position) re-
gardless of the position of A ring. The 1 warning light will come
on in the instrument panel.

DIRECTION INDICATORS
Put the stalk in the stable position:
❍ upward: activation of right direction indicator;
❍ downward: activation of left direction indicator.
Lights ¥ or Î will flash on the instrument panel. The direction in-
dicators are switched off automatically when the steering wheel
is straightened.

“Lane change” function
If you want to signal that you are changing lane, hold the left stalk
in the unstable position for less than half a second. The direction
indicator on the selected side flashes five times and then switch-
es off automatically.

WINDOW CLEANING

The right stalk controls windscreen wiper/washer and heated rear
windscreen wiper/washer operation.

Move the stalk up (unstable position) to limit operation to the time
for which the stalk is held in this position. When released, the stalk
will return to its default position and the wiper will be automati-
cally stopped.

WINDSCREEN WIPER/WASHER fig. 41
This only operates with the ignition turned to MAR. A Ring can take
three different positions:
O
≤ intermittent operation (low speed);
AUTO rain sensor activation (for versions/markets, where pro-
vided) (the windscreen wiper speed is automatically adapt-
ed to the intensity of the rain)

windscreen wiper off;

n intermittent operation;

≥ slow operation;
¥ fast operation.

fig. 41

A0K0097m

Do not use the windscreen wipers to remove lay-
ers of snow or ice from the windscreen. In such con-
ditions, the windscreen wipers may be subjected to
excessive stress, prompting intervention from the motor
protection which prevents operation for a few seconds. If
operation is not restored, even after turning the key and
restarting the engine, contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Ser-
vices.

Do not operate the windscreen wiper with the
blades lifted from the windscreen.

“Smart washing” function
Pull the stalk towards the steering wheel (unstable position) to op-
erate the windscreen washer jet. Keep the stalk pulled for more
than half a second, with just one movement, to operate windscreen
washer/wiper jet at the same time.
The wiper stops working three strokes after the stalk is released.
A further stroke after approximately six seconds completes the wip-
ing cycle.

RAIN SENSOR fig. 42
(for versions/markets, where provided)
This is an infrared LED sensor fitted on the windscreen. It can de-
tect the presence of rain and consequently manage windscreen wip-
ing in accordance with the amount of water on the windscreen.

Activation
The sensor is activated by turning the A ring fig. 41 to the
“automatic” position (“AUTO”): the frequency of the windscreen
wiper strokes is automatically adjusted depending on the amount
of water on the windscreen. This frequency can vary from no stroke
(no rain - windscreen dry) up to the 2nd constant speed operation
(heavy rain - windscreen wet).
Turn the A ring fig. 41 to vary the rain sensor sensitivity.

If the engine is switched off with the stalk in the automatic posi-
tion, no wiping cycle will take place when the engine is started
again even if it is raining. This prevents accidental activation of the
rain sensor when the engine is started (i.e. when the windscreen
is being washed by hand or the wipers are stuck to the windscreen
by ice).
To restore automatic operation of the rain sensor, turn the ring on
the right A stalk fig. 41 from automatic position (AUTO) to O po-
sition and then turn A ring back to the AUTO position.
When the rain sensor is reactivated using any of the manoeuvres
described above, reactivation is indicated by a single stroke of
the windscreen wipers, regardless of the condition of the wind-
screen. If the sensitivity of the rain sensor is adjusted whilst it is
in operation, a single stroke of the windscreen wiper takes place
to confirm the changed setting.
In the event of the malfunction of the rain sensor whilst it is ac-
tive, the windscreen wiper operates intermittently at a speed con-
sistent with the sensitivity setting of the rain sensor, regardless of
whether it is raining or not (the sensor fault is indicated on the
instrument panel display). The sensor continues to operate and it
is possible to set the windscreen wiper to continuous mode (1st
or 2nd speed). The fault indication remains for as long as the sen-
sor is active.

REAR WINDOW WIPER/WASHER
(for versions/markets, where provided)
Activation
This only operates with the ignition turned to MAR.
Turn B ring fig. 41 from position O to position ' to turn on the
rear window wiper as follows:
❍ intermittent operation if the windscreen wiper is off;
❍ synchronised operation (but with half-stroke frequency) when

the windscreen wiper is on;

❍ continuous operation with reverse engaged and windscreen

wiper on.

With reverse gear engaged and windscreen wiper on, the rear win-
dow wiper is activated in continuous mode. Pushing the stalk to-
wards the dashboard (temporary position) the rear window wash-
er jet will activate.
Keeping the stalk pushed for more than half a second also the rear
window wiper will activate. Releasing the stalk will activate the
smart washing function, as described for the windscreen wiper.

CRUISE CONTROL
(for versions/markets, where provided)

GENERAL INFORMATION
This is an electronic driving aid that allows you to drive at a speed
of above 30 km/h on long and straight dry roads (e.g. motor-
ways), at a preset speed without having to press the accelerator
pedal.
It is therefore not recommended to use this device on country roads
with traffic. Do not use it in town.

TURNING THE DEVICE ON
Turn ring A-fig. 43 to ON. The device cannot be turned on in 1st or
reverse gear. It is advisable to engage it in 5th gear or higher.

When travelling downhill with the device engaged, the car may
slightly exceed the preset speed. When the device is activated, Ü
light comes on together with the relevant message on the instru-
ment panel (for versions/markets, where provided).

STORING THE SPEED
Proceed as follows:
❍ turn A ring fig. 43 to ON and press the accelerator until the

car reaches the desired speed;

❍ move the stalk upwards (+) for at least one second, then re-
lease it. The speed is now stored and you can therefore release
the accelerator pedal.

If needed (when overtaking for instance), you can accelerate sim-
ply by pressing the accelerator pedal; when you come off the ped-
al, the car will return to the speed memorised previously.

RESTORING STORED SPEED
If the device was disengaged - for example by pressing the brake
or clutch pedal - the stored speed can be reset as follows:
❍ accelerate gradually until reaching a speed approaching the one

stored;

❍ engage the gear selected at the time of speed storing;
❍ press RES button (B-fig. 43).

INCREASING THE STORED SPEED
Press the accelerator and store the new speed or move the stalk
upwards (+). Each movement of the stalk will correspond to an
increase in speed of about 1 km/h, while keeping the stalk held
upwards the speed will continuously increase.

REDUCING THE STORED SPEED
Deactivate the device and store the new speed or move the stalk
downwards (–) until the new speed is reached. It will then auto-
matically be stored. Each movement of the stalk will correspond
to a reduction in speed of about 1 km/h, while keeping the stalk
held downwards will continuously reduce the speed.

TURNING THE DEVICE OFF
To turn the device off:
❍ turn the A ring fig. 43 to OFF;
❍ stop the engine;
❍ press the brake pedal, the clutch or the accelerator; in this
last case the system is not actually turned off but the system
gives priority to the acceleration request. The device still re-
mains active, without the need to press the RES button to re-
turn to the previous condition once acceleration is concluded.

Do not open the sun roof in the presence of snow
or ice: it may be damaged.

SUN CURTAINS
Grip the handle A-fig. 64 to open the curtain and pull in the direc-
tion of the arrow to achieve the required position. To close them,
carry out the procedure in reverse.

When leaving the car, always remove the key from
the ignition device to avoid the risk of injury due
to accidental operation of the sun roof; it presents
a risk to those left on board:
improper use of the roof
can be dangerous. Before round during operation, always
check that no-one is at risk of being injured by the mov-
ing sunroof or by objects getting caught and dragged
by it.

ANTI-PINCH SAFETY SYSTEM
The sun roof has an anti-pinch safety system capable of detecting
the presence of an object whilst the roof is closing; when this hap-
pens the system stops and the glass travel is immediately reversed.

Anti-pinch device
The car is equipped with an anti-pinch safety device for the upwards
motion of the windows.
The windows are fitted with an anti-pinch safety system that de-
tects the presence of an obstacle when they are closing and cuts
in by stopping the window and reversing it according to the posi-
tion of the window. This device is also useful when the windows
are activated accidentally by children on board the car.
The anti-pinch function is active both during manual and automat-
ic operation of the electric windows. Following the intervention of
the anti-pinch system, the window travel is immediately interrupt-
ed and subsequently reversed until the lower end of travel is
reached. The window cannot be operated in any way during this
time.

IMPORTANT If the anti-pinch protection intervenes 5 consecutive
times within a minute or is faulty, the automatic closing operation
of the window is inhibited, only allowing it in steps of half a sec-
ond; the button is released for the subsequent manoeuvre.

Open the concerned window to restore correct operation of the sys-
tem.

IMPORTANT With ignition key at STOP or removed, the electric win-
dows remain active for about 3 minutes and are deactivated the
moment a door is opened.

IMPORTANT On some versions when the Ë button on the remote
control is pressed for longer than 2 seconds the windows will open,
whilst if the Á button is pressed for longer than 2 seconds the
windows will close.

The system conforms to the 2000/4/EC standard
concerning the safety of passengers leaning out of
the passenger compartment.

Incorrect use of the electric windows may be danger-
ous. Before and during operation, always check that
no passenger is at risk of being injured directly by
the moving window or by objects getting caught in or dragged
by the window. When leaving the car, always remove the key
from the ignition device to avoid the risk of injury due to ac-
cidental operation of the electric windows. This is a danger to
the people still on board.

The reset operation should be carried out with the doors closed
according to the following procedure:
1. completely lower the driver-side window and keep the button
pressed for at least 3 seconds once the end of travel position
has been reached (lower end stop);

2. completely raise the driver-side window and keep the button
pressed for at least 3 seconds once the end of travel position
has been reached (upper end stop);

3. repeat stages 1 and 2 also for the passenger’s window
4. check that the initialisation has taken place correctly by check-

ing the automatic operation of the windows.

ABS SYSTEM

ABS is an integral part of the braking system, which prevents the
wheels from locking when braking, makes the most of road grip
and gives the best control when performing emergency braking un-
der difficult road conditions.
The EBD system (Electronic Braking Force Distribution) completes
the system, allowing the brake force to be distributed between the
front and rear wheels.

IMPORTANT For maximum efficiency of the braking system, a bed-
ding-in period of about 500 km is needed: during this period it is
better to avoid sharp, repeated and prolonged braking.

SYSTEM INTERVENTION
The brake pedal pulsates slightly and the system gets noisier: it
means that the speed should be altered to suit the type of road sur-
face.

If the ABS intervenes, it means you have almost
reached the limit of grip between the tyres and the
road surface: slow down to make sure you can use

the available grip.

The ABS gets the most out of the available grip,
but it cannot increase it; you must therefore always
take care when driving on skiddy roads. Do not

take any unnecessary risks.

When the ABS intervenes and you notice the brake
pedal pulsating, do not be afraid to keep the ped-
al pushed down. This will help you to stop in the
shortest distance possible, depending on the road condi-
tions.

VDC SYSTEM
(Vehicle Dynamics Control)

This is an electronic system that controls vehicle stability in the
event of tyre grip loss, helping maintain directional control. The sys-
tem is capable of recognising potentially dangerous situations in
terms of the stability and intervenes automatically on the brakes
in a differentiated manner for the four wheels in order to provide
a stabilizing torque.
The VDC, in turn, includes the following systems:
❍ Hill Holder
❍ ASR
❍ Brake Assist
❍ MSR
❍ CBC
❍ “ELECTRONIC Q2” (“E-Q2”)
❍ DST
❍ RAB

SYSTEM INTERVENTION
This is signalled by warning light á blinking on the instrument
panel to inform the driver that stability and grip conditions are
critical.

SYSTEM ACTIVATION
The VDC system switches on automatically each time the engine
is started and cannot be switched off.

HILL HOLDER SYSTEM
This system is an integral part of the VDC system and it is provided
to facilitate starting on slopes.
It is activated automatically in the following instances:
❍ uphill: car standing on a road with a gradient of more than 5%,
engine on, brake pedals pressed and gearbox in neutral or gear
(other than reverse) engaged;

❍ downhill: car at a standstill on a road with a gradient higher
than 5%, engine running, brake pedal pressed and reverse gear
engaged.

When setting off the VDC system control unit maintains the brak-
ing pressure at the wheels until the engine torque required for de-
parture is reached or for approximately 2 seconds, allowing your
right foot to be moved easily from the brake pedal to the acceler-
ator.
If the car does not start off after this time, the system will deacti-
vate automatically by gradually releasing the brake force. A noise
may be heard: this means that the car is about to start moving.

IMPORTANT the Hill Holder system should not be used as a hand-
brake. Do not leave the vehicle without having engaged the hand-
brake, switched off the engine and engaged a gear.

001-130 Alfa Giulietta EN 5ed  26-07-2010  16:34  Pagina 111

ASR SYSTEM (AntiSlip Regulation)
It is an integral part of the VDC system. It intervenes automatical-
ly if one or both of the drive wheels is slipping, there is a loss in
grip on a wet surface (aquaplaning), acceleration on slippery, snow-
covered or icy surfaces, etc.
Depending on how slippery the road is, two different control sys-
tems are activated:
❍ if the slipping involves both drive wheels, the ASR intervenes

reducing the power transmitted by the engine;

❍ if the slipping only involves one of the drive wheels, the ASR
intervenes automatically braking the wheel that is slipping.

In order for the ESP and ASR systems to operate
correctly, it is essential that the tyres are of the
same brand and type on all wheels, in perfect con-
dition and, above all, of the specified type, brand and size.

If the space saver wheel is used, the VDC system
keeps operating. Be aware however that the space
saver wheel, being smaller than the original wheel,

provides less grip.

The performance of the VDC and ASR systems
should not encourage the driver to take unneces-
sary risks. Your driving style should always take
road conditions, visibility and traffic into account. The dri-
ver is always ultimately responsible for road safety.

BRAKE ASSIST
(emergency braking assistance)
The system, which cannot be turned off, recognises emergency
braking (on the basis of the brake pedal operating speed) and
speeding up the response of the braking system. The Brake
Assist function is deactivated in the event of VDC system fault.

MSR SYSTEM
(Motor Schleppmoment Regelung)
This system is an integral part of the ABS, that intervenes, if there
is a sudden change to a lower gear, restoring torque to the engine,
thereby preventing excessive drive at the drive wheels which, es-
pecially in poor grip conditions, could lead to a loss in stability.

CBC SYSTEM (Cornering Braking Control)
This system improves the distribution of the braking pressure at the
four wheels (to fully exploit the grip available on the ground) when
braking round bends when the ABS intervenes. This improves stop-
ping distances and above all vehicle stability when cornering.

“ELECTRONIC Q2” SYSTEM (“E-Q2”)
The “Electronic Q2” system uses the braking system to create an
effect similar to a limited slip differential.
The front braking circuit, when accelerating around a corner, acts
on the inside wheel to increase the drive to the outside wheel (in-
creased load), dynamically and continuously distributing the torque
between the front drive wheels according to driving and road con-
ditions.
The system, combined with Mc Pherson front suspension, allows
particularly effective, sporty driving.

DST SYSTEM (Dynamic Steering Torque)
This function integrates Dual Pinion active steering into the opera-
tion of VDC. For particular manoeuvres, VDC controls the steering
to actuate a steering torque and assist the driver in the best pos-
sible way. The system operates the brakes and steering in a coor-
dinated manner to increase the suspension and safety level of the
car as a whole. The steering provides addition torque on the steer-
ing wheel.

RAB SYSTEM (Ready Alert Brake)
(“Dynamic” mode only)
By pre-approaching the brake pads (front and rear) after rapid ac-
celerator release, this function provides prompter braking and re-
duces stopping distance.

“Alfa DNA” SYSTEM
(Dynamic control system)

This device allows, using switch A-fig. 80 (on the central tunnel),
three response modes to be selected according to driving style
and road conditions:
❍ d = Dynamic (for sporty driving)
❍ n = Normal (normal driving mode)
❍ a = All Weather (driving mode for poor grip conditions, i.e. rain

and snow on the road)

The device also acts on the dynamic vehicle control systems (en-
gine, steering, VDC system, instrument panel).

DRIVING MODES
Switch A-fig. 80 is a monostable switch, i.e. it always remains in the
central position. The selected driving mode is indicated by the corre-
sponding LED coming on in the panel and by an indication on the re-
configurable multifunction display, as illustrated below:

START&STOP SYSTEM
(for versions/markets, where provided)

The Start&Stop system automatically stops the engine whenever
the car is stationary and starts it again when the driver wants to
move off. This improves the efficiency of the vehicle by reducing
fuel consumption, the emission of harmful gases and noise pollu-
tion.
The system is active every time the engine is started.

OPERATING MODES
Engine stopping mode
With the car at a standstill, the engine stops with the gearbox in
neutral and the clutch released.
NOTE The engine can only be stopped automatically after a speed
of about 10 km/h is reached, to prevent the engine from being
repeatedly stopped when driving at walking pace.
Symbol U fig. 81 appears on the display when the engine stops.

Engine restarting mode
Press the clutch pedal to restart the engine.

FAILED ENGINE CUT-OUT CONDITIONS
When the system is operating, due to comfort, emission control
and safety reasons, the engine does not stop in some conditions,
among which:
❍ engine still cold;
❍ very cold outside temperature;
❍ battery not sufficiently charged;
❍ heated rear windscreen on;
❍ windscreen wipers working at maximum speed;
❍ particulate filter regeneration in progress (diesel engines only);
❍ driver’s door not shut;
❍ driver’s seat belt not fastened
❍ reverse gear engaged (for example, for parking manoeuvres);
❍ for versions equipped with dual zone automatic climate control
system (for versions/markets, where provided), if an adequate
level of thermal comfort has not been reached or MAX-DEF func-
tion activation;

Notes
If the clutch is not pressed, after 3 minutes from the engine stop-
ping, the engine can be restarted only using the ignition key.
In cases when the engine stops and this is not desired, due for
example to the clutch pedal being released sharply with a gear
engaged, if the Start&Stop system is activated, the engine can
be restarted by fully depressing the clutch pedal or by placing the
gear lever in neutral

RESTARTING CONDITIONS
For reasons of comfort, limiting harmful emissions and safety pur-
poses, the power unit can restart automatically without any action
on behalf of the driver if certain conditions are met, including:
❍ battery not sufficiently charged;
❍ windscreen wipers working at maximum speed;
❍ low braking system vacuum, e.g. following the brake pedal be-

ing pressed repeatedly;

❍ car in motion, for example when driving on hilly roads;
❍ stopping the engine using Start&Stop longer than approxi-

mately 3 minutes;

❍ for versions equipped with dual zone automatic climate control
system (for versions/markets, where provided), if an adequate
level of thermal comfort has not been reached or MAX-DEF func-
tion activation;

With gear engaged, the automatic engine restarting is possible on-
ly by fully pressing the clutch pedal. This operation is indicated to
the driver by means of a message on the display and by symbol
U blinking (the latter for versions/markets, where provided).

SAFETY FUNCTIONS
When the engine is stopped by the Start&Stop system, if the dri-
ver releases his/her seat belt and opens the driver’s or passenger’s
door, the engine can be restarted only using the ignition key.
This condition is indicated to the driver by means of a buzzer and
by the symbol U blinking on the display (with a message, for
versions/markets, where provided).

STORING THE CAR
In the case of storage, special care must be taken to disconnect the
battery electrical power supply.
Proceed as follows: detach the connector A-fig. 83 (by pressing but-
ton B) from sensor C for monitoring the status of the battery in-
stalled on the battery negative pole D. This sensor should never
be disconnected from the pole except if the battery is replaced.

In case of battery replacement, always contact
Alfa Romeo Authorized Services. Replace the bat-
tery using a new one of the same type (HEAVY

DUTY) and having the same specifications.

ENERGY SAVING FUNCTION
(for versions/markets, where provided)
If, as a result of the engine automatic restarting, the driver does not
carry out any action on the vehicle for over 3 minutes, the Start&Stop
system stops the engine once and for all, to prevent fuel consump-
tion. In these cases, the engine can be restarted only using the ig-
nition key.
NOTE In any case, it is possible to keep the engine running by de-
activating the Start&Stop system.

OPERATING IRREGULARITIES
In the event of malfunctions the Start&Stop system is disabled.
The driver is informed of the fault by the symbol U blinking on
the display along with a message (the latter on some versions).
If this occurs, contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services.

EOBD SYSTEM
(European On Board Diagnosis)
(for versions/markets, where provided)

The aim of the EOBD (European On Board Diagnosis) system is to:
❍ to monitor system efficiency;
❍ indicate an increase in emissions;
❍ to warn of the need to replace deteriorated components.
The car also has a diagnostic connector that can be interfaced
with appropriate tools, which makes it possible to read the error
codes stored in the electronic control units together with a series
of specific parameters for engine operation and diagnosis. This
check can also be carried out by the traffic police.

IMPORTANT After eliminating a fault, to check the system com-
pletely, Alfa Romeo Authorized Services are obliged to run tests
and, if necessary, road tests which may also call for a long journey.

DUAL PINION ACTIVE STEERING

This only operates with the key turned to MAR and the engine start-
ed. The steering allows the force required at the steering wheel
to be adjusted to suit driving conditions. The different power as-
sistance modes can be selected via the d,n,a positions of the"Alfa
DNA System" lever (see paragraph entitled "Alfa DNA System").

IMPORTANT The steering system will need to be initialised after
disconnecting the battery. A warning light will come on to indicate
this. Simply turn the steering wheel all the way from one end to the
other or simply drive in a straight line for a few hundred metres.

Under no circumstances should aftermarket op-
erations be carried out involving steering system
or steering column modifications (e.g. installation
of anti-theft device). This could negatively affect perfor-
mance and safety, invalidate the warranty, cause serious
safety problems and also result in non-compliance of the
car with type-approval requirements.

RADIO TRANSMITTERS AND CELLULAR PHONES
Radio transmitting equipment (vehicle mobile phones, CB radios,
amateur radio etc.) shall not be used inside the car unless a sep-
arate aerial is mounted on the roof.

IMPORTANT The use of these devices inside the passenger com-
partment (without a separate aerial) may cause the vehicle elec-
trical systems to malfunction. This could compromise safety in ad-
dition to constituting a potential hazard for passengers’ health.

In addition, transmission and reception of these devices may be af-
fected by the shielding effect of the car body. As far as the use of
EC-approved mobile phones is concerned (GSM, GPRS, UMTS), fol-
low the instructions for use provided by the mobile phone manu-
facturer.

PARKING SENSORS
(for versions/markets, where provided)

The parking sensors are located on the rear bumper fig. 88 and
their function is to inform the driver, through an intermittent beep-
ing, of the presence of obstacles behind the car.

TURNING THE SENSORS ON
The sensors are turned on when reverse gear is engaged. As the
distance from the obstacle behind the car decreases, the beeping
becomes more frequent.

001-130 Alfa Giulietta EN 5ed  26-07-2010  16:34  Pagina 125

DISPLAY INDICATIONS
(for versions/markets, where provided)
When the sensor is activated, the "Reconfigurable multifunctional
display" (for versions/markets where provided) shows the screen
illustrated in fig. 88a; the information about the presence of and
distance from the obstacle is given by the buzzer and also by a
visual indication on the instrument panel display. If there are se-
veral obstacles, the closest one is indicated.

BUZZER WARNINGS
When reverse gear is engaged a buzzer warning is automatically
activated if there is an obstacle within the range of operation.
The acoustic signal:
❍ increases as the distance between the car and the obstacle de-

creases;

❍ becomes continuous when the distance between the car and
the obstacle is less that 30 cm and stops immediately if the
distance increases;

fig. 88a

A0K0059m

❍ remains constant if the distance between the vehicle and the
obstacle remains unchanged, whilst if this situation occurs for
the side sensors, the signal is interrupted after about 3 seconds,
for example, to prevent signals in the case of manoeuvres along-
side walls.

GETTING

YOUR CAR

IMPORTANT The volume of the audible signal can be adjusted th-
rough the option "Warnings volume" of the "Set-Up menu".

SAFETY

OPERATION WITH TRAILER
Parking sensor operation is automatically turned off when the trail-
er electric cable plug is fitted into the car tow hook socket. The sen-
sors are automatically enabled again when the trailer cable plug
is removed.

The sensor must be free of mud, dirt, snow or ice
in order for the system to work. Be careful not to
scratch or damage the sensors while cleaning them.
Avoid using dry, rough or hard cloths. The sensors should
be washed using clean water with the addition of car sham-
poo if necessary. In washing stations, clean sensors quick-
ly keeping the vapour jet/high pressure washing noz-
zles at a distance of at least 10 cm from the sensors.

For repainting the bumpers or retouching the paint-
work around the sensors contact Alfa Romeo
Authorized Services. Incorrect application of paint
may compromise the operation of the parking sensors.

The ultimate responsibility when parking and car-
rying out other dangerous manoeuvres still rests
with the driver. When carrying out such manoeu-
vres, always ensure that the manoeuvring area is free
of people (particularly children) and animals. Parking sen-
sors are designed to assist drivers; however, you must al-
ways concentrate fully during potentially dangerous ma-
noeuvres, even if carried out at low speeds.

GENERAL WARNINGS
During parking manoeuvres, pay the utmost attention to any ob-
stacles that could be located above or below the sensors.
Sometimes, objects located close to the rear part of the car may
not be detected by the system and may damage the car or become
damaged themselves.

Here below are some conditions that may influence the perfor-
mance of the parking system:
❍ Reduced sensor sensitivity and a reduction in the parking as-
sistance system performance could be due to the presence on
the surface of the sensor of: ice, snow, mud, thick paint.

❍ the sensor may detect a non-existent obstacle (echo noise) due
to mechanical noises, for example when washing the vehicle,
in case of rain, strong wind, hail.

❍ the signals sent by the sensors can also be altered by the pres-
ence of ultrasound devices (e.g. pneumatic brake systems or
pneumatic drills) near the car;

❍ sensor performance can also be influenced by the position of
the sensors. For example by a change in the ride setting (caused
by the wear of the shock absorbers, suspension), overloading
the car and carrying out specific tuning operations that require
the car to be lowered;

❍ the detection of obstacles at the top part of the vehicle may
not be guaranteed because the system detects obstacles that
could cause an impact with the vehicle in the bottom part.

REFUELLING THE CAR

Switch off the engine before refuelling.

PETROL ENGINES
Only use unleaded petrol. The petrol octane rating (RON) must not
be lower than 95.
In order to prevent damage to the catalytic converter never intro-
duce even the smallest amount of leaded petrol, even in the event
of an emergency.

DIESEL ENGINES
Only use diesel fuel compliant with European specification EN590.
The use of other products or mixtures may damage the engine
beyond repair and consequently invalidate the warranty, depend-
ing on the damage caused.

Operation at low temperatures
If the outside temperature is very low, the diesel thickens due to
the formation of paraffin clots with consequent defective operation
of the fuel supply system.
In order to avoid these problems, different types of diesel are dis-
tributed according to the season: summer type, winter type and
arctic type (cold, mountain areas). If refuelling with diesel fuel
whose features are not suitable for the temperature of use, it is ad-
visable to mix TUTELA DIESEL ART additive with the fuel, in the pro-
portions shown on the container. Pour the additive into the tank
before the fuel.
When parking or storing the car for a long time in the mountains
or cold areas, it is advisable to refuel using locally available fuel.
In this case, it is also advisable to keep the tank over 50% full.

FUEL FILLER CAP
The fuel cap is unlocked when the central locking system is released
and automatically locked when the central locking system is ap-
plied.

To open
Press the flap A-fig. 89 to release it and reach the fuel filler cap
B. Then press the cap B and turn it anticlockwise.
The cap has a loss prevention device C which secures it to the flap
so that it cannot be lost. Attach the cap to device D during refu-
elling.

How to open the flap in an emergency
In case of emergency, pull the cord A-fig. 90 on the right-hand side
of the boot to open the fuel flap.

Closing
Release the cap B from the device D and insert it in its housing.
Tighten the cap in a clockwise direction until one or more clicks are
heard. Finally, close the flap A and check that is it correctly locked.
The hermetic seal may cause a slight increase in pressure in the
tank. A suction noise when you release the cap is therefore entirely
normal.

Do not place naked flames or lit cigarettes near
to the fuel filler: fire risk. Keep your face away
from the fuel tank opening to avoid breathing in

harmful vapours.

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT

The devices for reducing petrol engine emissions are the following:
catalytic converter, lambda sensors and anti-evaporation system.
The following devices are used for reducing diesel fuel engine emis-
sions: oxidising catalytic converter, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)
and particulate filter (DPF).

DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTER (DPF)
(for versions/markets, where provided)
This is a mechanical filter, fitted in the exhaust system, which al-
most completely eliminates carbon particle emissions.

The catalytic converter and particulate filter (DPF)
reach very high temperatures during operation.
Do not park the vehicle on grass, dry leaves, pine

needles or other flammable material: fire hazard.

Remember that, in the event of a violent collision,
backseat passengers not wearing seat belts rep-
resent a serious danger to the front-seat passen-

gers as well as to themselves.

IMPORTANT When putting the back seats back to their normal po-
sition, make sure the seat belts are positioned so they are ready
to use. 

IMPORTANT The backrest is correctly secured when the “red band”
B-fig. 94 in the backrest lowering levers A disappears. This red band
indicates that the backrest is not secured. 

Make sure the backrest is properly secured on both
sides (red bands B-fig. 94 not visible) to prevent it
from moving forward in the event of sharp brak-

ing, which may cause injuries to passengers.

SBR SYSTEM 
(Seat Belt Reminder)

This system comprises of an acoustic signal, which in conjunction
with the < warning light flashing on the instrument panel display,
warns the driver and front passenger if their seat belts have not
been fastened.  

On some versions there is also a panel (provided as an alternative
to the warning lights on the instrument panel) located above the
rear-view mirror fig. 95, which warns the front and back seat pas-
sengers via acoustic and visual signals if their seat belts have not
been fastened.
Contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services to deactivate this system
permanently. The SBR system can only be reactivated via the dis-
play Set Up Menu (see chapter “Knowing your car”).
The red and green warning lights work as follows fig. 95:
❍ 1 = front left seat (this indicates the driver’s seat state in left-

hand drive versions)

❍ 2 = rear left seat (passenger)
❍ 3 = rear middle seat (passenger)
❍ 4 = rear right seat (passenger)
❍ 5 = front right seat (this indicates the passenger seat state in

right-hand drive versions)

Front seats (warning light no. 1 = driver and
no. 5 = passenger)
Driver 
If the driver is the only occupant and the seat belt is not fastened,
when 20 km/h is exceeded or when travelling at a speed from 10
to 20 km/h for longer than 5 seconds, an acoustic signal sequence
will be started (front seats) consisting of a tone for 6 seconds fol-
lowed by a 90 second beep. The warning light will blink.  Once the
cycle is complete, the warning lights stay on with a fixed light un-
til the car is turned off.  The acoustic signal will be interrupted im-
mediately when the driver’s seat belt is fastened and the warning
light will turn green.  
If the seat belt is again unfastened when the car is in motion, the
acoustic signal and the red warning light blinking resume as de-
scribed previously. 

Passenger 
A similar solution applies for the front passenger, with the differ-
ence that the warning light turns green and the signal is interrupted
also when the passenger leaves the car. 
If both front seat belts are unfastened with the car in motion a few
seconds apart, the acoustic signal will refer to the most recent event
while the two warning lights will issue a visual signal independently.

Rear seats (warning light no. 2, no. 3 
and no. 4)
The signalling cycle is run only when any rear seat belt is unfas-
tened (blinking red).  In this condition, the  warning light referred
to the seat belt which has been unfastened will start blinking (red)
for approximately 30 seconds. An acoustic signal will also sound.  
The visual signal (blinking red) will start and end independently for
each warning light if several seat belts are unfastened. The visual
signal will turn green after the corresponding seat has been fas-
tened. 
The rear seat warning lights will go out, regardless of the state of
the belt (red or green) approximately 30 seconds after the last sig-
nal.

WARNINGS
All warning lights will remain off if all the seat belts (front and rear)
are already fastened when the key it turned to MAR.
All the warning lights will come on when at least one belt changes
from fastened to unfastened status or vice versa.

PRETENSIONERS

The car is equipped with front seat belt pretensioners, which draw
back the seat belts by several centimetres in the event of a strong
frontal impact. This guarantees the perfect adherence of the seat
belts to the occupant’s bodies before the retention action begins.
It is evident that the pretensioners have operated when the belt
withdraws toward the reel. 
This car is also equipped with a second pretensioner (in the kick
plate area). Its activation is signalled by the shortening of the met-
al cable. 
A small amount of smoke may be produced when the pretension-
ers cut in. This smoke is not toxic and does not indicate a fire. 

IMPORTANT To obtain the highest degree of protection from the ac-
tion of the pretensioner, wear the seat belt, keeping it close to
the chest and pelvis. 

The pretensioner does not require any maintenance or lubrication.
Anything that modifies its original conditions invalidates its effi-
ciency.  If, due to unusual natural events (floods, sea storms, etc.),
the device has been affected by water and mud, it must be re-
placed.

LOAD LIMITERS 
To increase protection in case of an accident, the front seat belt
reels are equipped with a device which modulates the force act-
ing on the chest and shoulders during the belt restraining action
in the event of a frontal impact.

The pretensioner can be used only once. Once it
has activated contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Ser-
vices to have it replaced.  See the label inside the
glove box to check the expiration date of the device: go
to Alfa Romeo Authorized Services when it is time to re-
place it. 

Operations which lead to impacts, vibrations or lo-
calised heating (over 100°C for a maximum of six
hours) in the area around the pretensioners may
damage or deploy them. These devices are not affected
by vibrations caused by uneven road surfaces or low ob-
stacles such as kerbs, etc. Contact Alfa Romeo Authorized
Services to intervene.

The seat belt must not be twisted. The upper part must cross the
shoulder and the chest diagonally.  The lower part must adhere to
the hips fig. 97, not to the abdomen. Do not use devices (clips,
etc.) to hold the seat belt away from your body.

For maximum safety, keep the back of your seat
upright, lean back into it and make sure the seat
belt fits closely across your chest and hips.  Always
fasten the seat belts on both the front and the rear seats.
Travelling without seat belts will increase the risk of severe
injury and even death in the event of an accident.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 
THE SEAT BELTS
Respect and ensure that all the other occupants of the car respect
the local laws in force regarding the use of seat belts.  Always
fasten the seat belts before starting off. 
Seat belts must also be worn by pregnant women: the risk of in-
jury in the event of an accident is reduced for them and the unborn
child if they are wearing a seat belt.
Pregnant women must position the lower part of the belt very
low down so that it passes under the abdomen fig. 96.

Each seat belt should be used by only one person at a time: nev-
er travel with a child sitting on the passenger’s lap with a single
belt to protect them both fig. 98. Do not fasten other objects to
the body.

If the belt has been subjected to heavy strain, for
example after an accident, it must changed com-
pletely together with the anchors, anchor fasten-
ing screws and the pretensioner. Even if the belt has no
visible defects, it could have lost its resilience.

Never disassemble or tamper with the seat belt
or pretensioner components.  All operations must
be performed by qualified and authorised per-
sonnel.  Always contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services.

SEAT BELT MAINTENANCE 

❍ Always use the seat belts with the belt taut and never twist-

ed; make sure that it is free to run smoothly;

❍ replace the belt after a serious accident, even if it does not
appear damaged. Always replace the belt if the pretensioners
were deployed. 

❍ To clean the seat belts, hand wash with water and neutral soap,
rinse and leave to dry in the shade. Do not use strong deter-
gents, bleach, paints or any other chemicals which could dam-
age the belt fibres. 

❍ prevent the reels from getting wet: their correct operation is

guaranteed only if water does not get inside;

❍ replace the seat belt when it shows significant wear or cuts.

CARRYING CHILDREN SAFELY

For optimum protection in the event of a crash, all passengers must
be seated and wearing adequate restraint systems. This is even
more important for children.  This prescription is compulsory in all
EC countries according to EC Directive 2003/20/EC.  Compared
with an adult, a child’s head is larger and heavier in proportion to
his/her body and the child’s muscular and bone structures are
not fully developed.  For this reason, they require restraint systems
which are different from those used by adults to protect them in
the event of an accident. 
The result of research in relation to the best protection for chil-
dren is illustrated in European Regulation ECE-R44, which divides
child seats into five groups in addition to making their use com-
pulsory: 
Group 0 
up to 10 kg
Group 0+ up to 13 kg
Group 1 
Group 2 
Group 3 
All restraint devices must bear the type-approval data along with
the control mark on a label firmly secured to the child seat which
must never be removed.  When over 1.50 m in height, from the
point of view of restraint systems, children are considered as adults
and have to wear the standard seat belts. 

9-18 kg
15-25 kg
22-36 kg

Lineaccessori Alfa Romeo includes child seats for each weight group.
These devices are recommended, having been specifically designed
for Alfa Romeo cars.

Do not arrange child seats facing backwards if the
front air bag on the passenger’s side is enabled.
Deployment of the air bag in an accident could
cause fatal injuries to the baby regardless of the severity
of the collision. It is advisable to carry children in dedi-
cated child seats on the rear seat, which is the most pro-
tected position in the event of an accident.

Should it be absolutely necessary to carry a child
on the front seat in a cradle seat facing backwards,
the passenger’s front air bag and side bag should
be deactivated by using the Set-Up Menu. Deacti-
vation can be verified by checking the “ warn-
ing light in the instrument panel. Also, the passenger seat
should be adjusted as far back as possible to avoid con-
tact between the child seat and the dashboard.

FITTING “UNIVERSAL” CHILD SEAT 
(with seat belts)

GROUP 1 fig. 100
From 9 to 18 kg of weight, children may be carried facing forward.  

GROUP 0 and 0+ fig. 99
Babies up to 13 kg must be carried facing backwards on a cradle
seat, which, by supporting the head, does not induce stress on
the neck in the event of sharp deceleration.  The cradle is restrained
by the car seat belts, as shown in the diagram, and in turn it must
restrain the child with its own belts. 

The diagrams are indicative and provided for as-
sembly purposes only. Fit the child seat according to
the instructions that must be supplied with the seat. 

There are seats with Isofix hooks which enable se-
cure fastening to the seat without using the car’s
seat belts.

Main safety rules to be followed 
when carrying children:

❍ install the child seats on the rear seat, which is the most pro-

tected position in the event of an accident.

❍ when the passenger front air bag is deactivated always check
that the F warning light remains permanently lit to confirm
the deactivation;

❍ carefully follow the instructions supplied with the child seat,
which are mandatory by law. Keep the instructions in the car
along with the other papers and this handbook.  Do not use
child seats without instructions; 

❍ always check the seat belt is well fastened by pulling the belt;

❍ only one child is to be strapped to each retaining system;
❍ always check the seat belts do not rest around the child’s neck;
❍ while travelling, do not let the child sit incorrectly or release the

belts;

❍ Never carry children on your lap, even newborns. No-one could

hold on to a child in the event of an accident; 

❍ In the event of an accident, replace the child seat with a new

one.

FRONT AIRBAGS
The car is provided with multistage front air bags (“Smart bag”)
for driver and passenger.

“SMART BAG” SYSTEM
(MULTISTAGE FRONT AIR BAGS)
The front driver/passenger air bags are designed to protect occu-
pants in the event of head-on crashes of medium-high severity,
by placing the bag between the occupant and the steering wheel
or dashboard.
The air bag do not replace, but rather complement the use of seat
belts, which should always be worn.  In the event of an impact,
someone not wearing a seat belt could move forward and come
into contact with a bag which is still in the opening phase. The pro-
tection offered by the bag is reduced in such a case.
Front air bags may not be activated in the following situations:
❍ front collisions against highly deformable objects not affect-
ing the front surface of the car (e.g. bumper collision against
guard rail, etc.);

❍ car penetration under other vehicles or protective barriers (e.g.

trucks or guard rails);

in these instances they could not provide any additional protec-
tion compared with seat belts, so their deployment would not be
useful.  In these cases, non-deployment of the airbag does not nec-
essarily indicate a system malfunction.

Do not apply stickers or other objects to the steer-
ing wheel, passenger side air bag cover or upper
side upholstery.  Do not place objects on the pas-
senger side dashboard because these could interfere with
the correct opening of the air bag and cause severe injury
to occupants.

FRONT AIR BAG ON DRIVER’S SIDE fig. 106
This is located in a dedicated compartment in the centre of the steer-
ing wheel.

Always drive with your hands on the steering wheel
rim so that the air bag can inflate freely if need-
ed. Do not drive with your body bent forward.

Keep your back straight against the backrest.

FRONT AIRBAG ON PASSENGER’S SIDE 
fig. 107
This is located in a dedicated compartment in the dashboard. 

Deactivating the passenger front air bag and
side bag
Deactivate the passenger front air bag and chest protection side
bags when carrying a chid on the front seat. With the air bags de-
activated, the “ warning light is lit in the instrument panel.

Do not arrange cradle child seats facing backwards
if the front air bag on the passenger’s side is en-
abled.  Deployment of the air bag in an accident
could cause fatal injuries to the baby regardless of
the severity of the collision. Always deactivate the
passenger’s air bag when placing a child seat on the front
seat. Also, the passenger seat should be as far back as
possible to avoid contact between the child seat and the
dashboard. Although this is not mandatory by law, the air
bag should be immediately reactivated when children are
no longer carried to ensure better protection for adults.

To deactivate the air bags see “Knowing your
car” chapter, “Menu Items” paragraph.

SIDE AIR BAGS 
(SIDE BAG - WINDOW BAG)

The car is fitted with front side bags for driver and passenger for
protecting the chest, and window bags for protecting front and rear
passengers’ heads. 

FRONT SIDE BAGS fig. 108
These are comprised of two types of bags located in the front
back/rests, which protect the chest and pelvis area of passengers
in the event of a side impact of medium-high severity.

HEAD PROTECTION SIDE AIR BAGS 
(WINDOW BAGS) fig. 109 
It is formed by two "curtain" window bags are located behind the
side roof upholstery and are covered by special trimming. 
They were designed to protect the head of front and rear passen-
gers in case of side collisions, thanks to the wide cushion inflation
surface. 
The air bags are not deployed in the event of impact of low sever-
ity (for which the retaining action of the seat belts is sufficient).
It is therefore always necessary to wear seat belts. 
In the event of a side impact, the system provides best protection
if the passenger sits on the seat in a correct position, thus allow-
ing correct window bag deployment.

Do not hook rigid objects to the clothes hangers or
support handles.

Do not rest your head, arms or elbows on the door,
windows or on the window bag area to avoid in-
juries during inflation.

Never lean your head, arms or elbows out of the
window.

WARNINGS 
Do not wash the seats with water or pressurised steam (wash by
hand or at automatic seat washing stations). 
The front and/or side air bags may activate in the event of sharp
impacts to the underbody of the car (e.g. impact with steps, pave-
ments, potholes or road bumps etc.). 
A small amount of dust will be released when the airbags are de-
ployed.  This is not harmful and does not indicate a fire. Dust may
irritate your skin and eyes: in this case, wash with mild soap and
water.
All operations on air bags (inspections, repairs and replacement)
must be carried out by Alfa Romeo Authorized Services.
If the car is to be scrapped, contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Ser-
vices to have the air bags deactivated.
Pretensioners and airbags are deployed according to different log-
ics on the basis of the type of collision. Failure to deploy of one
or more of these devices does not therefore indicate a system fault.

If the warning light ¬does not turn on when the key
is turned to MAR, or if it stays on when travelling (to-
gether with the message on the display on some ver-
sions), there could be a failure in the restraint systems. If
this is the case, the air bags or pretensioners may not be de-
ployed in the event of an accident or, less likely, they may
be deployed accidentally. Do not drive the car and contact
a Alfa Romeo Authorised Service Provider to have the sys-
tem checked immediately.

With the ignition key inserted and turned to MAR,
the air bags can be deployed also with the car at
a standstill, if it is hit by another vehicle even if the
engine is off. For this reason, children must never sit on
the front seat, even if the car is not moving.  Remember
that no safety device (airbag or pretensioner) will be de-
ployed in a crash if the key is inserted and turned to the
STOP position. Failure to deploy in such cases must not
be considered a sign of malfunction.

The expiry dates of the pyrotechnic charge and
clock contact are shown in the plate installed in-
side the glove compartment. Go to an Alfa Romeo
Authorised Service Provider when the time to have them
replaced approaches.

When the ignition key is turned to MAR, the “
warning light turns on (front airbag on passenger’s
side enabled) and will blinks for a few seconds as
a reminder that the passenger airbag will be deployed
in the event of a crash and then go off.

Do not travel with objects on your lap, in front of
your chest, or between your lips (e.g. pipes, pen-
cils, etc.): you may be seriously injured in the event

of a crash with air bag deployment.

The front air bags are deployed in the event of
more severe collisions than those required for de-
ploying the pretensioners.

For collisions in the range between the two thresholds, it
is normal for only the pretensioners to be activated.

If someone tries to steal or damage your car, and
in the event of floods, have the air bag system
checked by an Alfa Romeo Authorised Service

Provider.

STARTING AND DRIVING

STARTING THE ENGINE 

STARTING PROCEDURE FOR PETROL VERSIONS 
Proceed as follows:
❍ engage the handbrake and place the gearbox in neutral;
❍ press the clutch pedal down to the floor without touching the

accelerator;

❍ turn the ignition key to AVV and let it go the moment the en-

gine starts.

IMPORTANT
❍ If the engine does not start on the first attempt, turn the igni-

tion key to STOP before repeating the operation.

❍ If, when the ignition key is at MAR, the instrument panel warn-
ing light Y remains on together with warning light U, turn
the key to STOP and then back to MAR; if the warning light
remains on, try with the other keys provided with the car. If
you are still unable to start the engine contact Alfa Romeo Au-
thorized Services.

❍ Never leave the ignition key on MAR when the engine is off.

STARTING PROCEDURE FOR DIESEL VERSIONS 
Proceed as follows:
❍ engage the handbrake and place the gearbox in neutral;
❍ turn the ignition key to the MAR position: warning lights m

and Y on the instrument panel will light up;

❍ wait for the warning lights to go out;
❍ press the clutch pedal down to the floor without touching the

accelerator;

❍ turn the ignition key to AVV as soon as warning light m goes
out. Waiting too long will waste the heating work carried out
by the glow plugs. Release the key as soon as the engine starts.

If warning light m blinks for approximately 1
minute after starting or during prolonged crank-
ing, this indicates a fault in the glow plug pre-heat-
ing system. Use the car normally if the engine starts and
go to Alfa Romeo Authorized Services as soon as possible.

It is dangerous to have the engine running indoors.
The engine takes in oxygen and discharges carbon
dioxide, carbon monoxide and other toxic gases.

It is advisable not to demand maximum perfor-
mance from your car (e.g. excessive acceleration,
long distances at top rpm, excessively intense brak-

ing, etc.) when it is first used. 

When the engine is switched off never leave the
key in the MAR position to prevent useless cur-
rent absorption from draining the battery.

Remember that the brake servo and electro-
mechanical power steering are not operational un-
til the engine has been started, therefore much
more effort than usual is required on the brake pedal and
steering wheel.

HOW TO WARM UP THE ENGINE 
AFTER IT HAS JUST STARTED  
Proceed as follows:
❍ drive off slowly, letting the engine turn at medium speed. Do

not accelerate abruptly;

❍ do not demand maximum performance for the first few kilo-
metres. Wait until the engine coolant temperature indicator
starts moving.

STOPPING THE ENGINE 
Turn the ignition key to STOP while the engine is idling. 

IMPORTANT After a taxing drive, before turning the engine off you
should allow it to idle to allow the temperature in the engine com-
partment to fall.

Never jump start the engine by pushing, towing or
driving downhill. These manoeuvres may damage
the catalytic converter.

A quick burst on the accelerator before turning off
the engine serves absolutely no practical purpose;
it wastes fuel and is especially damaging to tur-

bocharged engines.

PARKING THE CAR

Switch off the engine and pull up the handbrake. Engage a gear
(1st if the car is facing uphill or reverse if it is facing downhill) and
leave the wheels steered to one side. 
If the car is parked on a steep slope block the wheels with a wedge
or stone. Always remove the ignition key when leaving the car.

HANDBRAKE fig. 110 
To engage the handbrake pull lever A upwards until the car is se-
cured. To disengage slightly raise lever A, press and hold down but-
ton B and lower the lever.

IMPORTANT Carry out these manoeuvres with the brake pedal pressed.

IMPORTANT For cars equipped with a front armrest, lift this up to
ensure that it does not interfere with the action of the handbrake.

The car should be locked after a few notches: if this
is not so, contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services to
have the handbrake adjusted.

USING THE GEARBOX 

To engage the gears, press the clutch pedal down fully and shift
the gear lever into the required position (a diagram is shown
on the knob  fig. 111).
To engage 6th gear, operate the lever by pressing it towards the
right in order to avoid engaging 4th gear by mistake. Similar ac-
tion to pass from sixth to fifth gear. 
To engage reverse gear (R) from the neutral position, lift up ring 
A-fig. 111 and simultaneously move the lever to the left and then
forwards.

IMPORTANT Reverse may be engaged only when the car is at a
standstill. 

Press the clutch pedal fully to change gears cor-
rectly. Therefore, the floor area under the pedals
must be clear: ensure that any rubber mats are flat

and do not interfere with the pedals.

Do not drive with your hand resting on the gear
lever, because this pressure, even if light, can wear
out the inner components of the gearbox over

time.

SAVING FUEL 

Here are some suggestions which may help you to save fuel and
lower the amount of harmful emissions released into the atmos-
phere.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Car maintenance 
Have checks and adjustments carried out in accordance with the
“Scheduled Servicing Plan” (see chapter “Servicing and mainte-
nance”).

Tyres  
Check the tyre pressure at least once every 4 weeks: if the pres-
sure is too low, consumption levels increase as resistance to rolling
is higher. 

Unnecessary loads 
Do not travel with an overloaded boot. The weight of the car and
its arrangement greatly affect fuel consumption and stability. 

Roof rack/ski rack 
Remove the roof rack or the ski rack from the roof after use. These
accessories decrease aerodynamic penetration and have a nega-
tive effect on fuel consumption. It is better to use a trailer to trans-
port particularly bulky objects. 

Electric devices 
Use electric devices only for the amount of time needed. The heat-
ed rear windscreen, additional headlights, windscreen wipers and
heater fan require a considerable amount of energy; increasing the
current uptake increases fuel consumption (by up to +25% in an
urban cycle). 

Climate control system
Using the climate control system will increase consumption: use
the air vents when the external temperature so allows.

Spoilers 
The use of non-certified spoilers may adversely affect aerodynam-
ics and fuel consumption.

CONDITIONS OF USE 

Cold starting 
Short distances and frequent cold start-ups prevent the engine from
reaching its optimum running temperature. Consequently, both con-
sumption (from +15 to +30% on the urban cycle) and emissions
will increase. 

Traffic and road conditions  
High fuel consumption is caused by heavy traffic, for instance when
travelling in a queue with frequent use of low gears or in cities with
many traffic lights. Mountain roads and uneven surfaces also have
a negative effect on consumption. 

Traffic hold-ups 
During prolonged hold-ups (level crossings) the engine should be
switched off.

151-160 Alfa Giulietta EN 3ed  13-04-2010  11:46  Pagina 156

GETTING 
TO KNOW 
YOUR CAR

SAFETY

DRIVING STYLE 
Starting 
Do not warm up the engine at low or high revs when the car is
stationary; this causes the engine to warm up more slowly, there-
by increasing fuel consumption and emissions. It is advisable to set
off immediately and slowly, avoiding high revs: this allows the
engine to warm up more quickly. 

Unnecessary actions 
Avoid revving up when starting at traffic lights or before stopping
the engine. The latter action, like double-declutching, is unneces-
sary and causes increased fuel consumption and pollution. 

Gear selection 
Use a high gear when traffic and road conditions allow. Using a
low gear for faster acceleration will increase fuel consumption. In
the same way, improper use of a high gear increases fuel con-
sumption, emissions and engine wear.

Top speed 
Fuel consumption considerably increases as speed increases. Keep
your speed as even as possible, avoiding unnecessary braking
and acceleration which cause excessive fuel consumption and in-
creased emissions. 

Acceleration 
Accelerating violently severely affects consumption and emissions:
acceleration should be gradual and should not exceed the maxi-
mum torque.

TOWING TRAILERS 

IMPORTANT
The car must be provided with a type-approved tow hook and ad-
equate electric system to tow caravans or trailers. Installation must
be carried out by a specialist. 
Install any specific and/or additional rear-view mirrors in accor-
dance with the highway code of the country in which you are trav-
elling. 
Remember that when towing a trailer, steep hills are harder to climb,
braking distances increase and overtaking takes longer depending
on the overall weight. 
Engage a low gear when driving downhill, rather than constantly
using the brake. 
The weight of the trailer reduces the load capacity of the car by the
same amount. Consider the weight at full load, including acces-
sories and luggage, to make sure you do not exceed the maximum
towable weight (shown in the registration document). 
Respect the speed limits specific to each country for vehicles tow-
ing trailers. In any event do not exceed 100 km/h.

INSTALLING A TOW HOOK 
Contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services to install a tow hook.

The ABS with which the car is equipped will not con-
trol the braking system of the trailer. Take extra
care when travelling on slippery roads.

Never modify the braking system of the car to con-
trol the trailer brake. The trailer braking system
must be fully independent from the hydraulic sys-

tem of the car.

SNOW TYRES

Use snow tyres of the same size as the normal tyres provided
with the car. Alfa Romeo Authorized Services will advise you on the
most appropriate tyre for use.
Only use these tyres in the event of ice or snow on the roads. 
For the type, pressures and specifications of the snow tyre to be
used, follow carefully the instructions given in the “Wheels” para-
graph of the “Technical specifications” chapter. 
The performance of these tyres is considerably reduced when the
tread depth is less than 4 mm. If this is the case, replace them. 
Due to their specific features, the performance of snow tyres is
much lower than that of standard tyres in normal conditions or on
long motorway stretches. You should therefore use them only in
the conditions for which they were designed. 

The performance of these tyres is considerably reduced when the
tread depth is less than 4 mm. If this is the case, replace them. 
All four tyres should be the same (brand and track) to ensure greater
safety when driving, during braking and better driveability. Re-
member that it is inappropriate to change the direction of rotation
of tyres.

The maximum speed for snow tyres marked “Q”
is 160 km/h, while it is 190 km/h for “T” tyres
and 210 km/h for “H” tyres. You should, howev-
er, always stick to the speed limits of the highway code.

SNOW CHAINS 

STORING THE CAR

The use of snow chains should be in compliance with local regu-
lations. Snow chains may be fitted only to the front wheel tyres
(drive wheels). 
Check the tension of the chains after the first few metres have been
driven. 
Use reduced bulk snow chains:
– All versions: for 195/55 R16”, 205/55 R16” and 225/45
R17” size tyres use low-clearance snow chains with a maximum
protrusion beyond the tyre profile of 9 mm.

IMPORTANT The space-saver wheel cannot be fitted with snow
chains. If a front (drive) wheel is punctured and snow chains must
be used, you must remove a normal wheel from the rear and re-
place this one with the space-saver wheel. In this way, with two
normal drive wheels, it is possible to use snow chains.

Keep your speed down when snow chains are fit-
ted - do not exceed 50 km/h. Avoid potholes, steps
and pavements and also avoid driving for long dis-
tances on roads not covered with snow to avoid damag-
ing the car and the road surface.

If the car is to be left inactive for longer than a month, the following
precautions should be noted:
❍ park the car in a dry, covered and, if possible, ventilated area;
engage a gear and check that the handbrake is not engaged;
❍ disconnect the negative battery terminal and check battery
charge. Repeat this check once every three months during stor-
age; 

❍ clean and protect painted areas using protective wax;
❍ clean and protect the shiny metal areas using special com-

mercially-available products;

❍ sprinkle talcum powder on the rubber windscreen and rear win-

dow wiper blades and lift them off the glass;

❍ slightly open the windows;
❍ cover the car with a fabric or perforated plastic sheet. Do not
use compact plastic sheets which do not allow humidity to evap-
orate from the surface of the car. 

❍ inflate tyres to a pressure of +0.5 bar above the normal spec-

ified pressure and check the pressure at regular intervals;

❍ if you have not disconnected the battery, check the battery

charge every thirty days;

❍ do not drain the engine cooling system.

IN AN EMERGENCY

In an emergency we recommend that you call the freephone number found in the Warranty Booklet. 

You can also consult www.alfaromeo.com to find your nearest Alfa Romeo Authorized Services. 

STARTING THE ENGINE 
If the Y warning light in the instrument panel remains on con-
stantly, contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services immediately.

JUMP STARTING  
If the battery is flat, the engine may be started using an auxiliary
battery with the same capacity or a little higher than the flat one. 
For engine starting follow the procedure below, fig. 112:
❍ connect the positive terminal (+) of the booster battery only
with the point indicated on the vehicle battery (writing OK 
figure 112) and nowhere else;

❍ with a second lead, connect the negative terminal (–) of the
auxiliary battery to an earthing point E on the engine or the
gearbox of the car to be started;

❍ when the engine has been started, follow the sequence above

in reverse order to remove the leads.

Contact an Alfa Romeo Authorised Service Provider if you cannot
start the engine after several attempts.

IMPORTANT Never connect the negative terminals of the two bat-
teries directly! If the auxiliary battery is installed on another car,
prevent accidental contact between metallic parts of the two cars.

BUMP STARTING 
Never start the engine by pushing, towing or driving downhill.

CHANGING A TYRE 

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
The car is equipped with an “Automatic Fix&Go Kit“: see “Auto-
matic Fix&Go Kit” for how to use this device.
Alternatively  to  the  “Automatic  Fix&Go  Kit”  the  car  may  be
equipped with a space-saver spare wheel: see the instructions on
the following pages for changing the tyre.

The space-saver spare wheel is vehicle-specific:
do not use it on vehicles of other model and do not
use space-saver spare wheels from other models
on your car. The space-saver spare wheel must only be
used in an emergency. Never use it longer than strictly
necessary and never exceed 80 km/h. On the space-saver
spare wheel there is a label, summarizing the main warn-
ings about the space-saver spare wheel usage restrictions.
Never remove or cover the label. Never apply any hub
cap to the space-saver spare wheel. 

Use your hazard lights, warning triangle, etc. to
show that your car is stationary in compliance with
regulations. Passengers should get out of the car,
particularly if it is heavily loaded, and wait for the wheel
to be changed away from the traffic. In the event of a
wheel change on a slope or on unsurfaced roads, chock
the wheels.

Vehicle handling is modified with the space-saver
spare wheel fitted. Avoid violent acceleration and
braking, sharp steering and fast cornering. The
overall duration of the space-saver spare wheel is of about
3000 km, after which the relevant tyre must be replaced
with another one of the same type. Never install a tradi-
tional tyre on a rim designed to be used as a space-saver
spare wheel. Repair and refit the standard wheel as soon
as possible. Using two or more space-saver spare wheels
at the same time is forbidden. Do not apply grease to
the bolt threads before assembly: they might sponta-
neously unscrew.

The jack may be used to replace wheels only on
the car that it comes with or other cars of the same
model. Never use the jack for other purposes, such
as lifting other models. Never use the jack to carry out re-
pairs under the car. Incorrect positioning of the jack may
cause the car to fall. Do not use the jack for loads higher
than the one shown on its label. Never install snow chains
on the space-saver spare wheel; if a front tyre (driving
wheel) is punctured and you need to use snow chains, use
a standard wheel from the rear axle and install the space-
saver spare wheel on the rear axle. In this way, with two
normal drive wheels, it is possible to use snow chains.

If the hub cap is not fitted correctly, it may come
off when the car is travelling. Never tamper with
the inflation valve. Never introduce tools of any
kind between the rim and the tyre. Regularly check the
inflation pressure of the tyres and space-saver wheel (see
chapter “Technical specifications”).

JACK 
Important notes:
❍ the jack weight is 1.76 kg;
❍ the jack requires no adjustment;
❍ the jack cannot be repaired; if it breaks it must be replaced with

a new jack;

❍ no tool other than the cranking device may be fitted on the

jack.

❍ a pair of gloves located in the side compartment of the com-

pressor;

❍ adapters for inflating different elements.
IMPORTANT The sealing liquid is suitable for use at temperatures
in the range from –20°C to +50°C. The sealant has an expiry
date.

Hand over the instruction booklet to the personnel
charged with treating the tyre repaired with the
Automatic Fix&Go kit.

Do not operate the compressor for longer than 20
minutes consecutively. Risk of overheating. The kit
is not suitable for permanent repairs. The tyres re-

paired may only be used temporarily.

Dispose of the bottle and sealing liquid it contains
properly. Dispose according to the national and local
laws in force.

In the event of a puncture caused by foreign bod-
ies, the kit may be used to repair tyres showing
damage to the tread or shoulder up to a maximum

diameter of 4 mm. 

It is not possible to repair damage to the tyre side-
wall. Do not use the kit on tyres damaged by run-
ning with a flat tyre.

If the wheel rim is damaged (the channel is so de-
formed as to cause air leakage) it cannot be re-
paired. Do not remove the foreign body (screw

or nail) from the tyre.

The bottle contains ethylene and latex: it may
cause an allergic reaction. Harmful if swallowed.
Irritating for eyes. There could be a reaction in the
event of inhalation or contact. Avoid contact with the eyes,
skin and clothes. In the event of contact, wash immedi-
ately with plenty of water. Do not induce vomiting if swal-
lowed. Rinse your mouth and drink plenty of water. Call
a doctor immediately. Keep away from children. The prod-
uct must not be used by asthmatics. Do not breathe in
the vapours during insertion and suction. Call a doctor im-
mediately if allergic reactions are noted. Store the bottle
in the specific compartment, away from sources of heat.
The sealant has an expiry date. Replace the cylinder if
its sealant is out of date.

Wear the gloves included in the kit.

❍ make sure that switch A-fig. 126 for the compressor is in po-
sition 0 (off), start the engine, insert the plug into the luggage
compartment current socket (see fig. 126a) or cigar lighter on
central tunnel (see fig. 127) and switch on the compressor
by bringing switch A-fig. 126 to position I (on);

Proceed as follows:
❍ apply the handbrake, loosen the cap from the tyre inflation
valve, extract the flexible tube A-fig. 125 and screw ring nut
B onto the tyre inflation valve;

❍ inflate the tyre to the pressure shown in the “Wheels” para-
graph in the “Technical Specifications” chapter. In order to ob-
tain a precise reading, check the pressure on pressure gauge
B-fig. 126 with the compressor off;

❍ if after 5 minutes you cannot reach at least 1.8 bar, unplug the
compressor from the valve and the socket, then move the car
forward about ten metres in order to distribute the sealant in-
side the tyre evenly, then repeat the inflation operation;

❍ if you still cannot obtain a pressure of at least 1.8 bar within
5 minutes from the compressor switching on, do not drive off
and contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services;

❍ after driving for about 10 minutes, stop and check the tyre pres-

sure again; remember to put the handbrake on;

Apply the adhesive label where it can be easily
seen by the driver as a reminder that the tyre has
been treated with the quick repair kit. Drive care-
fully, particularly on bends. Do not exceed 80 km/h. Do
not accelerate or brake suddenly. 

If the pressure has fallen below 1.8 bar, do not dri-
ve any further: the Automatic Fix&Go quick tyre
repair kit cannot guarantee proper hold because
the tyre is too damaged. Contact Alfa Romeo Authorized
Services.

❍ if a pressure value of at least 1.8 bar is detected, restore the
correct pressure (with the engine running and the handbrake
engaged), and drive with care to Alfa Romeo Authorized Ser-
vices.

Remember to inform the workshop that the tyre
has been treated with a quick repair kit. Give the
instruction booklet to the personnel charged with

handling the treated tyre.

CHANGING A BULB 

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 

❍ Before changing a bulb check the contacts for oxidation;
❍ blown bulbs must be replaced with others of the same type

and power:

❍ after replacing a headlight bulb, always check its alignment;
❍ when a light is not working, check that the corresponding fuse
is intact before changing the bulb. For the location of fuses, re-
fer to the “Changing a fuse” paragraph in this section.

Halogen bulbs must be handled holding the metal-
lic part only. Touching the transparent part of the
bulb with your fingers may reduce the intensity
of the light emitted and even compromise the longevity
of the bulb itself. In the event of accidental contact, wipe
the bulb with an alcohol-soaked cloth and leave to dry.

Modifications or repairs to the electrical system
(electronic control units) that are not carried out
properly or do not take the technical specifications
of the system into account can cause malfunctions lead-
ing to the risk of fire.

Halogen bulbs contain pressurised gas which may
cause small fragments of glass to be projected out-
wards if the bulb is broken. 

Due to the high power supply voltage, gas dis-
charge bulbs (Bi-Xenon) should only be replaced
by specialised personnel: danger of death! Contact

Alfa Romeo Authorized Services.

IMPORTANT When the weather is cold or damp or after heavy rain
or after washing, the surface of headlights or rear lights, may steam
up and/or form drops of condensation on the inside. This is a nat-
ural phenomenon due to the difference in temperature and humidity
between the inside and the outside of the glass which does not
indicate a fault and does not compromise the normal operation of
lighting devices. The mist disappears quickly turning the lights on,
starting from the centre of the diffuser, extending progressively
towards the edges.

LIFTING THE CAR

TOWING THE CAR

If you need to lift the car contact Alfa Romeo Authorized Services,
who will be equipped with a workshop lift. 
IMPORTANT Be careful when positioning the lift for versions with
side spoilers.

The tow ring provided with the car is housed in the tool box in
the boot.

ATTACHING THE TOW HOOK 
Manually release the plug A pressing in the lower part, take the
tow hook from its seat in the tool support and tighten it securely
on the front threaded pin (fig. 159) or on the rear threaded pin
(fig. 160).

Before beginning to tow, turn the ignition key to
MAR and then to STOP, without extracting it When
the key is removed, the steering wheel lock auto-
matically activates, making it impossible to turn the
wheels.

The brake servo and the electrical power steering
will not work while the car is being towed. More
effort on the brake pedal and steering wheel will
therefore be required. Do not use wires for towing. Do not
jerk. Be careful not to damage parts in contact with the
car while towing. Respect the specific rules of the Highway
Code when towing the car, specifically in relation to the
towing device and conduct on the road. Do not start the
engine while towing the car. Clean the threaded seat care-
fully before fastening the hook. Make sure that the hook
is fully fastened in the seat before towing the car.

The front and rear tow hooks must only be used
for emergency situations on the road. The car may
be towed for short distances when a dedicated de-
vice is used in compliance with the Highway Code (rigid
bar), and in order to move the vehicle on the road in
preparation for towing by a tow truck. Tow hooks MUST
NOT be used to tow vehicles off the road or where there
are obstacles and/or for towing operations using cables
or other non-rigid devices. Respecting the above condi-
tions, towing must take place with two vehicles (one tow-
ing, the other towed) aligned as much as possible along
the same centre line.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

IMPORTANT NOTES 
❍ At 2000 km from the next service operation the display will

show a message.

❍ Scheduled Servicing operations are required by the manufac-
turer. Failure to comply with the schedule may invalidate the
warranty. 

❍ It is advisable to inform Alfa Romeo Authorized Services of any

small faults without waiting for the next scheduled service.

SCHEDULED SERVICING 
Correct maintenance is essential for ensuring long car life under the
best conditions. 
For this reason, Alfa Romeo has prepared a series of checks and
service operations to be carried out every 30,000 kilometres (for
1.4 petrol versions) or every 35,000 kilometres (for 1750 Turbo
Petrol and diesel versions).
Check the items on the Scheduled Servicing Plan (e.g. periodical-
ly check level of liquids, tyre pressure, etc.) before 30,000/
35,000 km and between these services deadlines. 
Scheduled Service operations should be carried out at Alfa Romeo
Authorized Services according to a set time schedule. If, during
each operation, in addition to the ones scheduled, the need aris-
es for further replacements or repairs, these may be carried out on-
ly with the explicit agreement of the Customer. 
If your car is used frequently for towing, the interval between one
service operation and the next should be reduced.

ous damage to the engine, it is essential to observe the following:

- only use spark plugs specifically certified for Turbo Petrol engines; all spark plugs should be of the same type and brand
(see the “Engine” paragraph in the “Technical Specifications” chapter);
- adhere strictly to the spark plug replacement intervals detailed in the Scheduled Servicing Plan; 
- You are advised to go to Alfa Romeo Authorized Services to have the spare plugs replaced.

2 If the car is mainly used in cities or travels less than 10,000 km a year, change the engine oil and filter every 12

months.

REGULAR CHECKS 

DEMANDING USE OF THE CAR

Every 1,000 km or before long journeys, check and top up the fol-
lowing if necessary:
❍ engine coolant level, brake fluid and windscreen washer fluid
❍ tyre pressure and condition;
❍ operation of lighting system (headlights, direction indicators,

hazard lights, etc.);

❍ operation of the windscreen wiper/washer system, position

and wear of windscreen/rear window wiper blades;

Check and top up, if required, the engine oil level every 3,000 km.
We recommend the use of PETRONAS LUBRICANTS, designed and
produced specifically for Alfa Romeo cars (see “Capacities” table
in the “Technical Specifications” chapter).

If you use the car mainly under one of the following conditions:
❍ trailer or caravan towing;
❍ dusty roads;
❍ short (less than 7-8 km) and repeated journeys in sub-zero

temperatures;

❍ frequent engine idling, travelling long distances at low speeds

or long term inactivity;

❍ in cities;
perform the following inspections more frequently than shown on
the Scheduled Servicing Plan:
❍ check front disc brake pad condition and wear;
❍ check cleanliness of bonnet and boot locks, as well as cleanli-

ness and lubrication of linkages;

❍ visually inspect the conditions of: engine, gearbox, transmis-
sion, pipes and tubes (exhaust - fuel - brakes), rubber parts
(boots, sleeves, bushes, etc.);

❍ check battery charge and liquid level (electrolyte);
❍ visually inspect the condition of auxiliary drive belts;
❍ check and if necessary change engine oil and oil filter;
❍ check pollen filter and replace it, if required;

CHECKING LEVELS 

Be careful not to confuse the various types of flu-
ids while topping up: they are all incompatible with
each other and may severely damage your car.

Never smoke while working in the engine com-
partment: flammable gases may be present. Risk
of fire.

Proceed very carefully inside the engine compart-
ment when the engine is hot:  risk of burns. Re-
member that the fan may start up if the engine is
hot: this could injure you.  Make sure that scarves, ties
and other loose fitting garments do not get caught up in
moving parts.

ENGINE COOLANT 
If the level is too low, undo reservoir cap C-fig. 161-162-163-164
and add the fluid described in “Technical Specifications” chapter.

PARAFLUUP anti-freeze is used in the engine cool-
ing system. Use the same fluid as in the cooling
system when topping up. PARAFLUUP may not be
mixed with any other type of fluid. If this accidentally
occurs, do not start the engine. Contact Alfa Romeo 
Authorized Services.

The engine cooling system is pressurised. If the cap
needs replacing, do so with another original or the
effectiveness of the system may be compromised.
Do not remove the cap from the reservoir when the en-
gine is hot: you may get burned

199-224 Alfa Giulietta EN 5ed  26-07-2010  16:39  Pagina 212

ENGINE OIL  
Check that the oil level is between the MIN and MAX references
on the dipstick A-fig. 161-162-163-164.
If the oil level is near or under the MIN line, add oil through the
filler A until it reaches the MAX line.

The oil level must never exceed the MAX line.

If the engine oil is being topped up, wait for the
engine to cool down before loosening the filler plug,
particularly for vehicles with aluminium plug (for
versions/markets where provided). CAUTION: risk of burns!

Engine oil consumption
The maximum engine oil consumption is usually 400 grams every
1000 km. During the initial period of use the engine oil consumption
conditions should be considered as having stabilised after the first
5000 - 6000 km.

Do not add oil with different characteristics to those
of the existing engine oil. 

Used engine oil and the replaced oil filter contain
substances that are harmful to the environment.
We recommend having the oil and oil filter re-

placed by Alfa Romeo Authorized Services.

WASHING FLUID 
If the level is too low undo reservoir cap D-fig. 161-162-163-
164 and add the fluid described in the “Technical Specifications”
chapter.

BRAKE FLUID 
Check that the fluid is at the maximum level.  If the level is too
low undo reservoir cap E-fig. 161-162-163-164 and add the flu-
id described in the “Technical Specifications” chapter.

Do not travel if the windscreen washer reservoir is
empty: using the windscreen washer is essential
for improving visibility. Some commercial wind-
screen washer additives are flammable. The engine com-
partment contains hot parts which could cause a fire if they
come into contact with these additives.

Prevent brake fluid, which is highly corrosive, from
coming into contact with painted parts. Should this
occur, immediately wash with water.

Brake fluid is poisonous and highly corrosive. In
the event of accidental contact, wash the parts im-
mediately with water and neutral soap, then rinse
with plenty of water.  In case of swallowing, immediate-
ly call a doctor.

The symbol π on the container indicates a syn-
thetic brake fluid, which is different from a min-
eral fluid.  Using a mineral-type fluid will dam-
age the special rubber seals of the braking system beyond
repair.

Contact  Alfa  Romeo  Authorized  Services  to  replace  these 
filters.

BATTERY

The electrolyte of the battery F-fig. 161-162-163-164 does not
need to be topped up with distilled water. A periodic check carried
out at Alfa Romeo Authorized Services is, however, necessary to
check efficiency. 

BATTERY REPLACEMENT 
When necessary, replace the battery with another original battery
with the same specifications. Follow the battery manufacturer’s in-
structions for maintenance. 

ADVICE FOR PROLONGING 
THE LIFE OF YOUR BATTERY
To avoid rapidly draining your battery and to prolong its life, ob-
serve the following indications: 
❍ when you park the car, ensure the doors, tailgate and bonnet
are closed properly in order to avoid the courtesy lights re-
maining on for longer than necessary;

❍ turn off the ceiling lights, although the car does have an au-

tomatic system for switching off internal lights;

❍ do  not  leave  devices  (e.g.  car  radio,  hazard  lights,  etc.)
switched on for a long time when the engine is not running;
❍ before performing any operation on the electrical system, dis-

connect the battery negative terminal.

IMPORTANT The steering system will need to be initialised after dis-
connecting the battery. A warning light g will come on to indi-
cate this. Simply turn the steering wheel all the way to one end
or simply drive on a straight line for a few hundred metres.

IMPORTANT If the battery remains with the charge below 50%
for a long time it becomes damaged through sulphation and its
starting capacity is reduced.
The battery will also be more at risk of freezing (this can happen
as early as –10°C). Refer to “Storing the car” in “Starting and
driving” if the car is left parked for a long time.
If after having purchased your car you decide to add accessories re-
quiring permanent electrical power (alarm etc.) or accessories that
require large amounts of power, please consult Alfa Romeo Au-
thorized Services. They can calculate the overall electrical require-
ment.

The battery fluid is poisonous and corrosive. Avoid
contact with the skin and the eyes. Keep naked
flames or possible sources of sparks away from the

battery: risk of explosion or fire. 

Using the battery when the fluid is too low dam-
ages it irreparably and can cause an explosion. 

Incorrect assembly of electric and electronic devices
may cause severe damage to your car. Go to an Al-
fa Romeo Authorised Service Provider if you want
to install accessories after having purchased your car
(alarms, mobile phone, etc.): they will be able to suggest
the most suitable devices and advise you if a higher ca-

gerous for the environment. Contact Alfa Romeo
Authorized Services to replace the battery.

STARTING 
AND DRIVING

If the car must remain unused for a long time at
very low temperatures, remove the battery and
take it to a warm place, to avoid freezing. 

When performing any operation on the battery
or near it, always protect your eyes with spe-
cial goggles.

WHEELS AND TYRES 

Before embarking on a long trip, and every two weeks, check the
tyre inflation pressure (and space-saver wheel); check the pressure
with the tyres cold. 
It is normal for the pressure to increase when the car is used; for
the correct tyre inflation pressure, see “Wheels” in the “Technical
specifications” section. 
Incorrect pressure causes abnormal tyre wear fig. 165:
A normal pressure: tread evenly worn.
B 
low pressure: tread particularly worn at the edges.
C  high pressure: tread particularly worn in the centre.
The tyres must be replaced when the tread is less than 1.6 mm
thick. 

IMPORTANT NOTES
Take the following precautions to prevent damage to the tyres: 
❍ avoid braking suddenly, racing starts and violent impact against
the curb, potholes or other obstacles and driving for extended
periods on unsurfaced roads;

❍ check the tyres regularly for cuts on the sides, swelling or ir-

regular tread wear;

❍ avoid travelling with the vehicle overloaded. If you puncture a

tyre, stop immediately and replace it;

❍ have the tyres checked by specialised personnel if they have
been fitted for longer than 6 years. Remember to check the
space-saver wheel very carefully;

❍ change the position of the tyres every 10-15 thousand kilo-
metres, keeping them on the same side of the vehicle to avoid
inverting the direction of rotation.

❍ a tyre will age even if it is not used much. Cracks in the tread
and on the sidewalls are a sign of ageing. In any event, have
the tyres checked by specialised personnel if they have been
fitted for longer than six years. Remember to check the space-
saver wheel very carefully;

❍ when replacing the tyres, always fit new tyres, avoiding those

of dubious origin;

❍ If a tyre is replaced, you should also change the inflation valve.

Remember that the road holding qualities of your
car also depend on the correct inflation pressure
of the tyres.  

WINDSCREEN/REAR WINDOW
WIPERS

If the pressure is too low, the tyre will overheat and
could be seriously damaged.

Avoid switching the tyres from the right side of the
vehicle to the left side and vice versa.  

Do not repaint alloy wheel rims at temperatures
higher than 150°C. The mechanical characteristics
of the wheels might be compromised. 

Driving with worn wiper blades is a serious haz-
ard, because visibility is reduced in bad weather.

BLADES 
We recommend replacing the blades once a year.
A few simple precautions can reduce the possibility of damage to
the blades:
❍ make sure that the rubber part is not frozen to the windscreen
in sub-zero temperatures. Use a de-icing product to release it
if required;

❍ remove any snow from the window;
❍ do not activate the windscreen/rear window wiper on a dry

window.

Replacing the windscreen wiper blades 
Proceed as follows:
❍ lift the windscreen wiper arm, press the tab A-fig. 166 of the

fastening clip and extract the blade from the arm;

❍ fit the new blade, inserting the tab into the dedicated housing
in the arm. Make sure that the new blade is secured in posi-
tion.

❍ lower the windscreen wiper arm on the windscreen.

Do not operate the windscreen wiper with the
blades lifted from the windscreen.

Lifting the wiper blades 
When the wiper blades have to be lifted from the windscreen (i.e.
in the event of snow), proceed as follows:
❍ turn the ignition key to the MAR position; 
❍ operate the lever to the right of the steering wheel to activate
a windscreen wiper stroke (see paragraph "Window wash-
ing" in chapter "Getting to know your car");

❍ turn the ignition key to the STOP position when the driver's
side wiper blade reaches the windscreen side pillar and lift the
windscreen wiper to the rest position; 

❍ bring the wiper blades back into contact with the windscreen

before activating the windscreen wiper.

BODYWORK

PROTECTION FROM ATMOSPHERIC AGENTS
The car is equipped with the best available technological solutions
to protect the bodywork against corrosion.
These are the most important:
❍ paint products and systems which give the car resistance to cor-

rosion and abrasion;

❍ use of galvanised (or pre-treated) steel sheets with high resis-

tance to corrosion;

❍ spraying protective plastic materials in the most exposed ar-

eas: underdoor, inner mudguard parts, edges, etc.;

❍ using “open” boxed sections to prevent condensation and pock-

ets of moisture from causing rust inside.

❍ use of special films to protect against abrasion in exposed ar-

eas (e.g. rear wing, doors, etc.).

BODY AND UNDERBODY WARRANTY
Your car is covered by warranty against perforation, due to rust,
of any original element of the structure or bodywork. For the gen-
eral terms of this warranty, refer to your Warranty Booklet.

PRESERVING THE BODYWORK
Paint
Touch up abrasions and scratches immediately to prevent the for-
mation of rust.
Maintenance of paintwork consists of washing the car: the fre-
quency depends on the conditions and environment where the
car is used. For example, it is advisable to wash the car more of-
ten in areas with high environmental pollution or salted roads.
To correctly wash the car:
❍ remove the aerial from the roof when using a carwash;
❍ in washing stations keep the steam jet/high pressure washing
nozzles at least 40 cm away from the bodywork to prevent dam-
age. It should be remembered that a build up of water could
cause damage, in the long term, to the car.

❍ wash the body using a low pressure jet of water;
❍ wipe a sponge with a slightly soapy solution over the body-

work, frequently rinsing the sponge;

❍ rinse well with water and dry with a jet of air or chamois leather.

When drying take care to dry the least visible parts where the
water could collect most easily. Do not wash the car after it has
been left in the sun or with the bonnet hot: this may alter the shine
of the paintwork.
Exterior plastic parts must be cleaned in the same way as the rest
of the car.

Detergents cause water pollution. Only wash the
car in areas equipped for the collection and pu-
rification of the fluids used in the actual washing

process. 

In order to preserve the aesthetic appearance of
the paintwork abrasive products and/or polishes
should not be used for cleaning the car.

IMPORTANT
Avoid parking under trees; the resin dropped by trees makes the
paintwork go opaque and increasing the possibility of corrosion. 
Bird droppings must be washed off immediately and thoroughly as
the acid they contain is particularly aggressive.

Windows
Use specific detergents and clean cloths to prevent scratching. 

IMPORTANT Wipe the rear window gently with a cloth in the di-
rection of the filaments to avoid damaging the heating device.

Front headlights
Use a soft, damp cloth soaked in water and detergent for wash-
ing cars.  

IMPORTANT Never use aromatic substances (e.g. petrol) or ketenes
(e.g. acetone) for cleaning the plastic lenses of the front head-
lights. 

IMPORTANT When cleaning the car with a pressure washer, keep
the water jet at least 2 cm away from the headlights.

Engine compartment 
At the end of every winter, wash the engine compartment thor-
oughly, taking care not to aim the jet of water directly at the elec-
tronic control units or at the windscreen wiper motors.  Have this
operation performed at a specialised workshop.

IMPORTANT The washing should take place with the engine cold
and the ignition key in the STOP position. After the wash, make
sure that the various protective devices (e.g. rubber caps and
guards) have not been removed or damaged.

Periodically check for water puddles under the mats that could cause
the panels to rust. 

SEATS AND FABRIC PARTS
Remove dust with a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner. It is advis-
able to use a moist brush on velvet upholstery. Wipe the seats with
a sponge soaked in a solution of neutral detergent and water.

LEATHER SEATS 
(on request for versions/markets, where provided)
Remove the dry dirt with a buckskin or slightly damp cloth, with-
out exercising too much pressure. 
Remove liquid or oil stains using a dry absorbent cloth, without rub-
bing. Then clean with a soft cloth or buckskin cloth dampened with
water and neutral soap. 
If the stain persists, use specific products and observe the instruc-
tions carefully.

IMPORTANT Never use alcohol. Make sure that the cleaning prod-
ucts used contain no alcohol or alcohol derivatives, even in small
quantities. 

STARTING

PLASTIC PARTS AND COVERS
Clean interior plastic parts with a damp cloth (if possible made from
microfibre), and a solution of water and neutral, non-abrasive de-
tergent. To clean oily or persistent stains, use specific products free
from solvents and designed to maintain the original appearance
and colour of the components.
Remove any dust using a microfibre cloth, if necessary moistened
with water. The use of paper tissues is not recommended as these
may leave residues. 

IMPORTANT Never use alcohol or petrol to clean the glass on the
instrument panel or other plastic parts.

(for versions/markets, where provided)
Use only water and neutral soap to clean these parts. Never use
alcohol or alcohol-based products.
Before using a specific product for cleaning interiors, make sure
that it does not contain alcohol and/or alcohol based substances.

Do not keep aerosol cans in the vehicle: these could
explode. Aerosol cans must not be exposed to a
temperature exceeding 50°C. When the vehicle
is exposed to sunlight, the internal temperature can great-
ly exceed this value.

Never use flammable products, such as petroleum
ether or modified petrol, to clean inside the car.
The electrostatic charges which are generated by

rubbing during cleaning may cause a fire.

As per the 
Scheduled 
Servicing Plan

For diesel engines, in the event of an emergency in which the original products are not available, lubricants with at least ACEA C2 performance are 
acceptable; however, in this case optimum engine performance is not guaranteed and the lubricants should be replaced with recommended products
as soon as possible at Alfa Romeo Authorized Services.
The use of products with features lower than ACEA A3 (petrol engines) and ACEA C2 (diesel engines) could cause engine damage not covered by war-
ranty.
For petrol engines with Multi Air system, use of lubricants with features lower than ACEA C3 and SAE grade other than 5W-40 could cause engine
damage which is not covered by warranty.

IMPORTANT The type of route, traffic situations, weather conditions,
driving  style,  general  conditions  of  the  car,  trim  level/
equipment/accessories, load, climate control system, roof rack,
other situations that affect air drag may lead to different fuel con-
sumption levels than those measured.

FUEL CONSUMPTION 

The fuel consumption figures given in the table below are deter-
mined on the basis of the homologation tests laid down by specific
European Directives.  
The procedures below are followed for measuring consumption:
❍ urban cycle: cold starting followed by driving that simulates

urban use of the car; 

❍ extra urban cycle: driving simulating the use of the vehicle in
a non-urban situation with frequent acceleration in all gears;
the speed varies between 0 and 120 km/h;

❍ combined consumption: about 37% of the urban cycle and

around 63% of the non-urban cycle.

The radio has been designed according to
the passenger compartment’s specific char-
acteristics and with a personalised design
that is incorporated perfectly with the style
of the dashboard.
The instructions for use are given below. We
recommend that you read them carefully.

TIPS

Road safety
Familiarise yourself with the various car ra-
dio functions (e.g. storing radio stations),
before starting to drive.

If the volume is too loud this
could be dangerous for the
driver and for passengers when dri-
ving in traffic. Always adjust the vol-
ume so that you can still hear back-
ground noises.

Reception conditions
Reception  conditions  change  constantly
while driving. Reception may be interfered
with by the presence of mountains, build-
ings or bridges, or when you are far away
from the broadcaster.
IMPORTANT The volume may be increased
when receiving traffic bulletins.

Care and maintenance
Only clean the cover with a soft, anti-static
cloth. Cleaning and polishing products could
damage the surface.

❍ only use CDs with the following brand :

❍ clean every CD to remove any finger-
prints or dust using a soft cloth. Hold CDs
by the circumference and clean them
from the middle outwards;

❍ never  use  chemicals  (e.g.  anti-static
products or thinners or sprays) for clean-
ing as they could damage the surface of
the CDs;

❍ after listening, place CDs back in their

cases to avoid damaging them;

❍ do not expose CDs to direct sunlight,
high temperatures or damp for long pe-
riods;

❍ do not stick labels on the surface of the
CD and do not write on the recorded sur-
face using pens or pencils;

❍ do  not  use  CDs  that  are  clearly
scratched, flawed, distorted, etc. Using
discs like this will result in malfunctions
or damage to the player;

❍ to achieve the best quality audio repro-
duction we recommend the use of orig-
inal CD media. If CD-R/RWs that have
not been correctly recorded and/or with
a maximum capacity above 650 MB are
used, correct operation is not guaran-
teed;

❍ do not use the protective sleeves sold
for CDs or discs with stabilizers, etc. be-
cause they may get stuck in the internal
mechanism and damage the disc;

❍ if copy-protected CDs are used, it may
take a few seconds before the system
starts playing them. The CD player is not
guaranteed to play all copy-protected
discs. The fact that the CD is protected
from being copied is often shown in very
small letters on the CD cover itself where
it may, for example, say “COPY CON-
TROL”, “COPY PROTECTED”, “THIS CD
CANNOT BE PLAYED ON A PC/MAC”, or
it may be identified through the use of
symbols, such as, for example:

❍ The CD player is capable of reading most
compression systems currently in use
(e.g.:  LAME,  BLADE,  XING,  FRAUN-
HOFER) but, following the development
of these systems, the reading of all com-
pression formats is not guaranteed.

AF SWITCHING function 
(alternative frequency
search)
The radio can operate in two different modes
in the RDS system:
❍ “AF Switching On”: search for alterna-
tive frequencies activated (the letters
“AF” appear on the display); 

❍ “AF Switching Off”: search for alterna-

tive frequencies not activated.

Proceed as follows to switch the function
on/off:
❍ press the MENU button and select “AF

❍ press the  (cid:5) / (cid:4) buttons to switch the

Switching On”;

function on/off. 

With the AF function deactivated, the re-
maining RDS functions such as the display
of the name of the radio station continue to
remain activated.
The AF function can only be activated on FM
bands.

With the function activated, the radio auto-
matically tunes into the station with the
strongest signal broadcasting the same pro-
gram. In this way when driving you can con-
tinue listening to the same station without
having to change the frequency when you
change areas. 
Obviously, it must be possible to receive the
station that you are listening to in the area
you are driving through.
If the AF function is activated, “AF” will light
up in the display.
If the AF function has been activated and
the radio is no longer capable of receiving
the station tuned into, the radio will activate
the automatic search during which the dis-
play will show “FM Search” (only for the
high end radio).

TRAFFIC INFORMATION
function (traffic information)
Some stations on the FM band (FM1, FM2
and FMA) can transmit information about
traffic conditions. In this case the letters “TA”
will appear on the display.
Proceed as follows to switch the TA function
on/off:
❍ briefly press the MENU button and se-

❍ press buttons (cid:5) / (cid:4) to switch the

lect “Traffic Info”;

function on/off.

If the TA function is activated, “TA” will light
up on the display.
IMPORTANT If the TA function is activated
with an audio source other than Tuner (Ra-
dio) (CD, MP3, Telephone or Mute/Pause),
the radio can carry out an automatic search
and therefore it is possible, when reactivat-
ing the Tuner (Radio) source, that the fre-
quency tuned into will be different from the
one set previously.

With the TA function it is possible to:
❍ search only for RDS stations that trans-
mit on the FM band, which are enabled
to transmit traffic information;

❍ receive traffic information even if the CD

player is on;

❍ receive traffic information at a minimum
preset volume even with the radio vol-
ume off.

IMPORTANT In some countries there are ra-
dio stations that do not broadcast traffic in-
formation even with the TP function acti-
vated (“TP” in the display).
If the radio is working on the AM band,
when the TA function is activated it will
switch to the last station tuned into on the
FM1 band. 

The volume at which the traffic news is trans-
mitted depends on the listening volume:
❍ listening volume below 5: traffic news

volume 5 (fixed value);

❍ listening volume above 5: traffic news
volume equal to listening volume +1.
If the volume is changed during a traffic up-
date, the level will not be shown on the dis-
play; the new level will only be maintained
during the update.
The display will show the words TRAFFIC IN-
FORMATION whilst a traffic update is being
received.
The TA function can be interrupted by press-
ing any button on the car radio.

REGIONAL MODE function
(reception of regional
broadcasts)
Some national broadcasters will transmit re-
gional programmes at certain times of the
day (that vary from region to region). This
function makes it possible to tune into lo-
cal (regional) broadcasters automatically
(see EON function paragraph). 
If you want the radio to automatically tune
into the regional stations being broadcast on
the network selected, the function must be
activated.
To turn the function on/off, use buttons (cid:5)
or (cid:4).

The current status of the function will appear
on the display: 
❍ “Regional On”: function activated;
❍ “Regional Off”: function deactivated.
If the function is deactivated and you have
tuned into a regional station working in a
given area and you enter a different area,
then the regional station received in the new
area will be broadcast.

WARNING If the AF and REG functions are
on at the same time, once a border between
two regions is crossed, the radio may not
switch correctly to a valid alternative frequen-
cy.

MP3 DISPLAY FUNCTION
(display of MP3 Compact Disc
information)
This function makes it possible to select the
information shown by the display when lis-
tening to a CD containing MP3 tracks.
The function can only be selected if a CD
MP3 is inserted: in this case “MP3 Display”
will appear on the display.
To change the function, use buttons (cid:5) or
(cid:4).
The following settings are available:
❍ “Title” (track title, if the ID3-TAG is avail-

able);

❍ “Author” (track author, if the ID3-TAG is

available);

❍ “Album” (track album, if the ID3-TAG is

will come on at the minimum volume.
❍ “Radio on vol – Limit off”: the radio will
come on at the volume level it was at
before switching off. The volume may
be between 0 and 40.

To change the setting use buttons  (cid:5) / (cid:4).

NOTES 
❍ Using the MENU it is only possible to ad-
just the activation/deactivation of the
function and not the minimum or max-
imum volume setting.

❍ If the “TA” or “TEL” functions or an out-
side audio source are activated when the
radio is turned on, the radio will come
on at the volume set for these sources.
When the outside audio source is deac-
tivated, the volume can be adjusted be-
tween the minimum and maximum lev-
els.

❍ If the battery charge is low, it will not
be possible to adjust the volume be-
tween the minimum and maximum
levels.

TELEPHONE SETUP
If a hands-free kit is installed on the car,
when there is an incoming phone call the
car radio audio will be connected to the tele-
phone output.  The telephone volume is al-
ways fixed, but it can be adjusted during a
conversation using the left knob A (fig.1).
The fixed telephone audio volume can be
adjusted using the “SPEECH VOLUME” func-
tion in the Menu. The word PHONE will ap-
pear on the display during the deactivation
of the audio for the phone call. 

ANTI-THEFT PROTECTION
The radio is equipped with an anti-theft pro-
tection system based on the exchange of in-
formation between the car radio and the
electronic control unit (Body Computer) on
the vehicle.
This system guarantees maximum security
and avoids the password having to be en-
tered every time after the radio power sup-
ply is disconnected.
If the outcome of the check is positive, the
radio will start to work, whilst if the codes
compared are not the same or if the elec-
tronic control unit (Body Computer) is re-
placed, the equipment will notify the user of
the need to enter the password following the
procedure in the paragraph below.

Entering the code
When the radio is switched on, if the pass-
word is requested, the display will show “Ra-
dio code” for about 2 seconds followed by
four dashes “- - - -”.
The code is made up of four numbers from
1 to 6, each corresponding to one of the
dashes.
To enter the first number, press the button
corresponding to the preset stations (from
1 to 6). Enter the other code numbers in the
same way.
If the four digits are not entered within 20
seconds, the display will show “Enter code
- - - -”. If this occurs, it is not considered an
incorrect code entry.

Code Card
This document certifies ownership of the car
radio. The Code Card contains the model of
the radio, the serial number and the pass-
word.

IMPORTANT Keep the Code Card somewhere
safe so that the authorities can be supplied
with the relevant information if the radio is
stolen.

After the fourth number is entered (within
20 seconds), the car radio will start to func-
tion.
If an incorrect code is entered, the radio will
emit a sound and the display will show “Ra-
dio blocked/wait” to notify the user of the
need to enter the correct code.
Each time the user enters an incorrect code,
the waiting time will gradually increase (1
min, 2 min, 4 min, 8 min, 16 min, 30
min,1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 16h, 24h) up to a
maximum of 24 hours. The waiting time will
be  shown  on  the  display  by  “Radio
blocked/wait”. After the message disap-
pears, the code entering procedure may be
started again.

tion of the function.
When the AutoSTore function is over, the ra-
dio automatically tunes into the first prese-
lected station on the FMA band on the pre-
setting 1 side.
The stations that have a strong signal at that
moment are then automatically stored in the
preselected band in the buttons numbered
1 to 6.
When the AutoSTore function is activated
within the MW band, the FMA band is au-
tomatically selected and the function is per-
formed.

IMPORTANT Sometimes the AutoSTore func-
tion does not manage to find 6 stations with
a strong signal. In this case, the strongest
stations will be duplicated in the free pre-
set buttons.
IMPORTANT When the AutoSTore function is
activated, the stations that were previously
stored on the FMA band are deleted.

EMERGENCY ALARM 
RECEPTION
The radio can receive emergency alerts in RDS
mode in exceptional circumstances where
dangerous situations are threatened (earth-
quakes, floods, etc.) if these are being trans-
mitted by the broadcaster tuned into.
This function is activated automatically and
cannot be turned off.
The word Alarm will be shown in the display
during the transmission of an emergency an-
nouncement. The volume of the radio will
change during this announcement in the
same way as during a traffic bulletin.

EON FUNCTION 
(Enhanced Other Network)
In some countries, there are circuits that
group multiple broadcasters that transmit
traffic information together. In this case, the
programme on the station that is being lis-
tened to will be temporarily interrupted to:
❍ receive traffic information (only with the

TA function on);

❍ listen to regional transmissions each time
they are transmitted by one of the broad-
casters in the same circuit.

STEREOPHONIC
BROADCASTERS
If the incoming signal is weak, the reproduc-
tion is automatically switched from Stereo
to Mono.

To load the CD, insert it gently into the slot
to activate the motorised loading system,
which will position it correctly.
The  CD  can  be  loaded  with  the  radio
switched off and the ignition key in the MAR
position: in this case the radio will remain
off. When the car radio is turned on, the last
source listened to prior to switching off will
be activated.
When a CD is loaded the display will show
“CD-IN” and the words “CD Reading”. They
will remain displayed for the entire time re-
quired for the car radio to read the CD tracks.

MP3 MODE
In addition to playing normal audio CDs, the
car radio is also capable of playing CD-ROMs
on which MP3 format compressed audio files
are  recorded.  The  radio  functions  as  de-
scribed in the “CD Player” chapter when an
ordinary audio CD is inserted.
The use of good quality media mastered at
the slowest possible speeds is recommend-
ed for optimum quality.
The files on the MP3 CD are in folders, with
sequential lists of all the folders containing
MP3 tracks (folders and sub-folders are all dis-
played on the same level) and folders that do
not contain MP3 tracks cannot be selected.

The operating conditions and specifications
for playing MP3 files are as follows:
❍ the CD-ROMs used must be mastered in
compliance with the ISO9660 Standard;
❍ the music files must have an “.mp3”
extension: files with a different exten-
sion cannot be played;

❍ the following sampling frequencies can
be played: 44.1 kHz, stereo (96 to 320
kbit/s) - 22.05 kHz, mono or stereo
(32 to 80 kbit/s);

❍ tracks with variable bit-rates can also be

played.

IMPORTANT The names of tracks must not
contain the following characters: spaces, ‘
(apostrophes), (and) (open and close brack-
ets). When an MP3 CD is being burned
make sure that the file names do not con-
tain these characters; otherwise, the car ra-
dio will not be able to play those tracks.

SELECTING MP3 SESSIONS ON
HYBRID DISCS
If a hybrid disc is inserted (Mixed Mode, En-
hanced, CD-Extra) also containing MP3 files,
the radio automatically starts playing the au-
dio session. It is possible to move to the
MP3 session whilst playing by keeping the
MEDIA button pressed for more than 2 sec-
onds.

IMPORTANT When the function is activated
the radio may take a few seconds to start
playback. Whilst checking the disc the dis-
play will show “CD READING”; if no MP3
files are detected, the radio will resume play-
ing the audio session from the point where
it was interrupted.

DISPLAY INFORMATION
ID3-tag information display
In addition to the information relating to the
time elapsed, the name of the folder and the
name of the file, the car radio is also capa-
ble of display ID3-TAG information relating
to the Track title, Artist and Author.
The name of the MP3 folder shown on the
display corresponds to the name with which
the folder was stored on the CD, followed
by an asterisk.
Example of a complete MP3 folder name:
BEST OF *.
If you wish to display ID3-TAG information
(Title, Artist, Album) and this information
has not been recorded for the track played,
the information will be replaced by informa-
tion relating to the name of the file.

SELECT NEXT/PREVIOUS
FOLDER
Press (cid:2) to select the next folder or (cid:3) to
select the previous folder. The display will
show the number and the name of the fold-
er (e.g.  “DIR 2 XXXXXX”).
XXXXXX: name of the folder (the display
will only show the first 12 characters). 
The folders are selected cyclically: the first
folder is selected after the last folder and
vice versa. 
If no other folder/track is selected during
the next 2 seconds, the first track contained
in the new folder will be played.
If the last track on the folder currently se-
lected is being played, the next folder will
be played. 

STRUCTURE OF THE FOLDERS
The car radio with MP3 player:
❍ only recognises those folders that effec-

tively contain MP3 format files

❍ if the MP3 files on a CD-ROM are struc-
tured in “sub-folders”, their structure is
compressed to a single level structure
where the “sub-folders” are at the level
of the main folders.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEALING WITH THE CAR AT THE END 
OF ITS LIFE

For years, Alfa Romeo has pursued a global commitment to protect and respect the environment by continually improving its
production processes and developing increasingly eco-compatible products. To ensure its customers the best possible service
in compliance with environment standards and in response to obligations arising out of European Directive 2000/53/EC on
end of life vehicles, Alfa Romeo offers its customers the chance to hand back their vehicles (*) at the end of their life cycle
at no additional cost.
The European Directive sets out that when the vehicle is handed over the last keeper or owner should not incur any expens-
es as a result of it having a zero or negative market value.  In all European Union countries, until 1st January 2007, only
vehicles registered after 1st July 2002 were collected free of charge, while since 2007 collection has been free of charge ir-
respective of the year of registration as long as the vehicle contains its basic components (in particular, the engine and body-
work) and has no additional waste.
To hand back your car at the end of its life without additional cost, you may contact one of our dealers or one of the collec-
tion and demolition centres authorised by Alfa Romeo. These centres have been carefully chosen to offer high quality service
for the collection, treatment and recycling of unused vehicles with respect to the environment.
You can find further information on these collection and scrapping centres either from an Alfa Romeo Authorized Services or
by calling the freephone number 00800 2532 0000 or on the Alfa Romeo website.
