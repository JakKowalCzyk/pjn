The airbag label is located on both
sides of the front passenger sun visor.
Airbag deactivation 3 62.

Front airbag system
The front airbag system consists of
one airbag in the steering wheel and
one in the instrument panel on the
front passenger side. These can be
identified by the word AIRBAG.
The front airbag system is triggered in
the event of a front-end impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and head of
the front seat occupants
considerably.

9 Warning

Optimum protection is only
provided when the seat is in the
proper position.
Seat position 3 47.
Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
Fit the seat belt correctly and
engage securely. Only then is the
airbag able to protect.

instructions and restrictions in the
table 3 66.

9 Danger

Do not use a child restraint system
on the passenger seat with active
front airbag.

Side airbag system

Seats, restraints

61

Curtain airbag system
The curtain airbag system consists of
an airbag in the roof frame on each
side. This can be identified by the
word AIRBAG on the roof pillars.
The curtain airbag system is triggered
in the event of a side-on impact of a
certain severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The side airbag system consists of an
airbag in each front and outer rear
seat backrest. This can be identified
by the word AIRBAG.
The side airbag system is triggered in
the event of a side impact of a certain
severity. The ignition must be
switched on.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the upper body and pelvis in
the event of a side-on collision
considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.

Note
Only use protective seat covers that
have been approved for the vehicle.
Be careful not to cover the airbags.

The inflated airbags cushion the
impact, thereby reducing the risk of
injury to the head in the event of a
side-on impact considerably.

9 Warning

Keep the area in which the airbag
inflates clear of obstructions.
The hooks on the handles in the
roof frame are only suitable for
hanging up light articles of
clothing, without coat hangers. Do
not keep any items in these
clothes.
Airbag deactivation
The front passenger airbag system
must be deactivated for child restraint
system on the passenger seat
according to the instructions in the
table 3 66. The side airbag and
curtain airbag systems, the belt
pretensioners and all driver airbag
systems will remain active.

Use the ignition key to choose the
position:
OFF* : front passenger airbag is
deactivated and will not
inflate in the event of a
collision. Control indicator
OFF* illuminates
continuously in the centre
console. A child restraint
system can be installed in
accordance with the chart
Child restraint installation
locations 3 66. No adult
person is allowed to occupy
the front passenger seat
ONV : front passenger airbag is

active. A child restraint
system must not be
installed

The front passenger airbag system
can be deactivated via a key-
operated switch in the glovebox.

If the control indicator * illuminates
after the ignition is switched on, the
front passenger airbag system is
deactivated. It stays on while the
airbag is deactivated.
If both control indicators are
illuminated at the same time, there is
a system failure. The status of the
system is not discernible, therefore
no person is allowed to occupy the
front passenger seat. Contact a
workshop immediately.
Consult a workshop immediately if
neither of the two control indicators
are illuminated.
Change status only when the vehicle
is stopped with the ignition off.
Status remains until the next change.

9 Danger

If using a rear-facing child restraint
system on the front passenger
seat, the airbag system for the
front passenger seat must be
deactivated. This also applies to
certain forward-facing child
restraint systems as indicated in
the tables 3 66.

Airbag deactivation 3 62, Airbag label

the head restraint to use position
3 46.

9 Danger

Deactivate passenger airbag only
in combination with the use of a
child restraint system, subject to
the instructions and restrictions in
the table 3 66.
Otherwise, there is a risk of fatal
injury for a person occupying a
seat with a deactivated front
passenger airbag.

If the control indicator Ó illuminates
for approx. 60 seconds after the
ignition is switched on, the front
passenger airbag system will inflate
in the event of a collision.

64
When a child restraint system is being
used, pay attention to the following
usage and installation instructions
and also those supplied with the child
restraint system.
Always comply with local or national
regulations. In some countries, the
use of child restraint systems is
forbidden on certain seats.
Child restraint systems can be
fastened with:
● Three-point seat belt
● ISOFIX brackets
● Top-tether
Three-point seat belt
Child restraint systems can be
fastened by using a three-point seat
belt. Depending on the size of the
used child restraint systems, up to
two child restraint systems can be
attached to the outboard seats.
3 66.

ISOFIX brackets

Either a Top-tether strap or a support
leg must be used in addition to the
ISOFIX mounting brackets.

i-size child seats and vehicle seats
with i-size approval are marked with
i-size symbol, see illustration.
Top-tether anchors
Top-tether anchors are marked with
the symbol : for a child seat.

Fasten vehicle-approved ISOFIX
child restraint systems to the ISOFIX
mounting brackets. Specific vehicle
ISOFIX child restraint system
positions are marked in the ISOFIX
table 3 66.
ISOFIX mounting brackets are
indicated by a label on the backrest.
An i-size child restraint system is an
universal ISOFIX child restraint
system according UN Regulation No.
129.
All i-size child restraint systems can
be used on any vehicle seat suitable
for i-size, i-size table 3 66.

Seats, restraints

65

Note
Do not affix anything on the child
restraint systems and do not cover
them with any other materials.
A child restraint system which has
been subjected to stress in an
accident must be replaced.

In addition to the ISOFIX mounting
brackets, fasten the Top-tether strap
to the Top-tether anchors.
ISOFIX child restraint systems of
universal category positions are
marked in the table by IUF 3 66.
Selecting the right system
The rear seats are the most
convenient location to fasten a child
restraint system.
Children should travel facing
rearwards in the vehicle as long as
possible. This makes sure that the
child's backbone, which is still very
weak, is under less strain in the event
of an accident.
Suitable are child restraint systems
that comply with valid UN ECE
regulations. Check local laws and
regulations for mandatory use of child
restraint systems.

The following child restraints are
recommended for the following
weight classes:
● Group 0, Group 0+: Maxi Cosi

Cabriofix with or without ISOFIX
base for children up to 13 kg

● Group I: Duo Plus with ISOFIX
and Top-tether for children from
9 kg to 18 kg

● Group II, Group III: Kidfix XP with

or without ISOFIX for children
from 15 kg to 36 kg

● Group III: Nania Dream for
children from 22 kg to 36 kg

Ensure that the child restraint system
to be installed is compatible with the
vehicle type.
Ensure that the mounting location of
the child restraint system within the
vehicle is correct, see following
tables.
Allow children to enter and exit the
vehicle only on the side facing away
from the traffic.
When the child restraint system is not
in use, secure the seat with a seat belt
or remove it from the vehicle.

LED headlights

9 Warning

Do not look directly into the LED
lights to avoid damage to your
eyes.

LED headlight system contains a
variety of particular LEDs in each
headlight which enables the control of
the Adaptive forward lighting
functions.
Light distribution and intensity of light
are variably triggered depending on
the lighting conditions, road type and
driving situation. The vehicle adapts

the headlights automatically to the
situation to enable optimal light
performance for the driver.
Some Adaptive forward lighting
functions of the LED headlights can
be deactivated or activated in the
vehicle personalisation menu. Select
the relevant setting in Settings, I
Vehicle in the Info-Display. Vehicle
personalisation 3 106.
The lighting functions are only
available with light switch in position
AUTO.
Country light

Activated automatically at a speed
between 55 km/h and 115 km/h when
driving in rural areas. The illumination
of the current lane and the side of the
road is improved. Oncoming and
preceding vehicles are not dazzled.

Lighting

117

Motorway light

Activated automatically at a speed
above 115 km/h. Illumination is
adapted to the higher speed driven on
motorways. If there is no oncoming
traffic, the visibility on the side of the
vehicle is increased. The visibility
range raises from 70 m to 140 m
allowing distant objects to be
recognized across the entire width of
the road.
Town light

Activated automatically at a speed up
to approx. 55 km/h and in situations
with exterior ambient light. The light is

Lighting

wide and symmetrical. If the speed is
below 30 mph, the headlamps are
slightly swiveled to the outside to
allow an earlier recognition of of
pedestrians and objects on each side
of the road. A special beam pattern is
designed to avoid glare for other road
users.
Corner light

When turning off, depending on the
steering angle and the turn signal
light, particular LEDs are triggered
which illuminate the direction of
travel. It is activated up to a speed of
40 km/h.

Adverse weather light

Curve light

Controlled by wiper or rain sensor and
activated at rain and snowfall. The
wide light distribution – slightly
swiveled to the outside – enables
improved orientation at the edge of
the road. The intensity of the light in
the far distance is increased in order
to recognize objects and markings on
the right road side and obstacles on
the lane despite the weather
condition. Lowering the reflection on
wet roads reduces dazzling of
oncoming traffic. Adverse weather
light is activated up to a speed to
70 km/h.

Particular LEDs, based on steering
angle and speed, are additionally
triggered to improve lighting in
curves. This function is activated at
speeds from 40 km/h to 70 km/h and
reacts to steering angle.
High beam assist
This feature allows the high beam to
function as main driving light at night.
The camera in the windscreen
detects the lights of oncoming or
preceding vehicles. Each LED on
right or left side can be triggered or
faded out particularly according to the
traffic situation. This gives the best
light distribution without dazzling
other road users. Once activated,
high beam assist remains active and
switches high beam on and off
depending on surrounding

conditions. The latest setting of the
high beam assist will remain after the
ignition is switched on again.

Activation

High beam assist includes a special
motorway mode. When driving faster
than 115 km/h on motorways, the light
beam becomes smaller to avoid
dazzling of oncoming traffic. When
following vehicles ahead or passing,
mirror dazzling for these vehicles is
reduced.

Activate the high beam assist by
pressing f on the turn and lane
change lever. The LED of the button
illuminates if the high beam assist is
activated. High beam is switched on
automatically at a speed above
25 km/h. High beam is switched off at
a speed below 15 km/h, but high
beam assist remains active.

easily ignitable surface. The
high temperature of the
exhaust system could ignite the
surface.

● Always apply the parking

brake.

● Switch off the engine.

Driving and operating

144
Emergency operation under
extreme cold temperatures

Engine exhaust

9 Warning

9 Danger

This emergency operation may
only be carried out in case of
extremely cold temperatures and if
the vehicle is parked on a level
surface.

In countries with extreme cold
temperatures it may be necessary to
park the vehicle without applied
parking brake.
This is an emergency operation to
avoid freezing of the parking brake.

Engine exhaust gases contain
poisonous carbon monoxide,
which is colourless and odourless
and could be fatal if inhaled.
If exhaust gases enter the interior
of the vehicle, open the windows.
Have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop.
Avoid driving with an open load
compartment, otherwise exhaust
gases could enter the vehicle.
Diesel particle filter
Automatic cleaning process
The diesel particle filter system filters
harmful soot particles out of the
exhaust gases.
The start of saturation of the particle
filter is indicated by the temporary
illumination of % or H,
accompanied by a message in the
Driver Information Centre.

As soon as the traffic conditions
permit, regenerate the filter by driving
at a vehicle speed of at least 60 km/h
until the control indicator
extinguishes.
Note
On a new vehicle, the first particle
filter regeneration operations may
be accompanied by a burning smell,
which is normal. Following
prolonged operation of the vehicle at
very low speed or at idle, you may,
in exceptional circumstances, notice
the emission of water vapour at the
exhaust on acceleration. This does
not affect the behaviour of the
vehicle or the environment.
Cleaning process not possible
If % or H stays on, accompanied
by an audible signal and a message,
this indicates that the particle filter
additive level is too low.
The reservoir must be topped-up
without delay. Seek the assistance of
a workshop.

Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the
amount of harmful substances in the
exhaust gases.

Caution

Fuel grades other than those listed
on pages 3 194, 3 245 could
damage the catalytic converter or
electronic components.
Unburnt petrol will overheat and
damage the catalytic converter.
Therefore avoid excessive use of
the starter, running the fuel tank
dry and starting the engine by
pushing or towing.

In the event of misfiring, uneven
engine running, a reduction in engine
performance or other unusual
problems, have the cause of the fault
rectified by a workshop as soon as
possible. In an emergency, driving
can be continued for a short period,
keeping vehicle speed and engine
speed low.

AdBlue
General information
The selective catalytic reduction
(BlueInjection) is a method to
substantially reduce the nitrogen
oxides in the exhaust emission. This
is achieved by injecting a Diesel
Exhaust Fluid (DEF) into the exhaust
system. The ammonia released by
the fluid reacts with nitrous gases
(NOx) from the exhaust and turns it
into nitrogen and water.
The designation of this fluid is
AdBlue®. It is a non-toxic, non-
flammable, colourless and odourless
fluid which consists of 32% urea and
68% water.

9 Warning

Avoid contact of your eyes or skin
with AdBlue.
In case of eye or skin contact,
rinse off with water.

Driving and operating

145

Caution

Avoid contact of the paintwork with
AdBlue.
In case of contact, rinse off with
water.

AdBlue freezes at a temperature of
approx. -11 °C. As the vehicle is
equipped with an AdBlue pre-heater,
the emissions reduction at low
temperatures is ensured. The AdBlue
pre-heater works automatically.
The typical AdBlue consumption is
approx. two litres per 1000 km, but

Refilling AdBlue

Caution

Only use AdBlue that complies
with European standards
DIN 70 070 and ISO 22241-1.
Do not use additives.
Do not dilute AdBlue.
Otherwise the selective catalytic
reduction system could be
damaged.

Note
Whenever a filling pump with a
nozzle for passenger cars is not
available at a filling station, use only
AdBlue bottles or canisters with a
sealed refill adapter for refilling, to
prevent splashback and overspill,
and in order to ensure that the fumes

from the tank are captured and do
not emerge. AdBlue in bottles or
canisters is available in many filling
stations and can be purchased e.g.
at Opel dealers and other retail
outlets.
Since AdBlue has a limited
durability, check the date of expiry
before refilling.
Note
The refilling of AdBlue is only
detected by the system when the
abovementioned liquid level switch
in the tank is activated.
In case AdBlue refill is not
successfully detected:
1. Continuously drive the vehicle

for 10 minutes making sure that
vehicle speed is always higher
than 20 km/h.

2. If AdBlue refill is detected

successfully, AdBlue supply-
driven limitations will disappear.

If AdBlue refill is still not detected,
seek the assistance of a workshop.
If AdBlue must be refilled at
temperatures below -11 °C, the
refilling of AdBlue may not be

Note
When unscrewing the protective cap
from the filler neck, ammonia fumes
may emerge. Do not inhale as the
fumes have a pungent smell. The
fumes are not harmful by inhalation.
The AdBlue tank should be filled
completely. This must be done if the
warning message regarding
prevention of an engine restart is
already displayed.
The vehicle must be parked on a level
surface.
The filler neck for AdBlue is located

Brakes
The brake system comprises two
independent brake circuits.
If a brake circuit fails, the vehicle can
still be braked using the other brake
circuit. However, braking effect is
achieved only when the brake pedal
is depressed firmly. Considerably
more force is needed for this. The
braking distance is extended. Seek
the assistance of a workshop before
continuing the journey.
When the engine is not running, the
support of the brake servo unit
disappears once the brake pedal has
been depressed once or twice.
Braking effect is not reduced, but
braking requires significantly greater
force. It is especially important to bear
this in mind when being towed.
Control indicator m 3 97.

Antilock brake system
Antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking.

ABS starts to regulate brake pressure
as soon as a wheel shows a tendency
to lock. The vehicle remains
steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent
through a pulse in the brake pedal
and the noise of the regulation
process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake
pedal fully depressed throughout the
braking process, despite the fact that
the pedal is pulsating. Do not reduce
the pressure on the pedal.
After starting off, the system performs
a self-test which may be audible.

Control indicator u 3 97.
Adaptive brake light
During full braking, all three brake
lights flash for the duration of ABS
control.

Fault

brakes release automatically as soon
as the vehicle begins to accelerate.

Ride control systems
Electronic Stability Control
and Traction Control system
Electronic Stability Control improves
driving stability when necessary,
regardless of the type of road surface
or tyre grip.
As soon as the vehicle starts to
swerve (understeer/oversteer),
engine output is reduced and the
wheels are braked individually.
Electronic Stability Control operates
in combination with the Traction
Control system. It prevents the driven
wheels from spinning.
The Traction Control system is a
component of the Electronic Stability
Control.
Traction Control improves driving
stability when necessary, regardless
of the type of road surface or tyre grip,
by preventing the driven wheels from
spinning.
As soon as the driven wheels starts to
spin, engine output is reduced and
the wheel spinning the most is braked

individually. This considerably
improves the driving stability of the
vehicle on slippery road surfaces.

Selective ride control

Caution

The vehicle is designed to drive
principally on tarmac roads, but it
also enables driving off-road
occasionally.

However, do not drive on terrain
where your vehicle could be
damaged due to obstacles, such
as stones among others and on
terrain with steep inclines and
poor grip.
Do not cross streams.

Caution

When driving off-road, sudden
motion and manoeuvres can make
you lose of the steering. This could
cause a collision. Therefore, when
driving on-road and off-road, you
and your passengers should wear
seat belts.

Selective ride control is designed to
optimise traction in low-grip
conditions (snow, mud and sand).
It adapts to the terrain by acting on the
front wheels, in doing so this saves
the weight normally associated with a
more conventional four wheel drive
system.

Selective ride control allows to
choose between five driving modes:
● ESC off mode
● Standard mode
● Snow mode
● Mud mode
● Sand mode
The several modes can be activated
by turning the control.
A LED illuminates and a status
message appears in the Driver
Information Centre to confirm the
chosen mode.

This mode is calibrated for a low level
of wheel spin, based on the different
types of grip generally encountered in
normal day to day driving.
Everytime the ignition is switched off,
the system is automatically reset to
this mode.

This mode adapts to the grip
conditions encountered by each
wheel when starting.
When advancing, the system
optimises wheel spin to guarantee the
best acceleration based on the
available traction. Recommended in
cases of deep snow and steep
inclines.
This mode is active up to a speed of
50 km/h.

Driving and operating

158
Mud mode

Sand mode

Sport mode

This mode allows considerable wheel
spin at start-up for the wheel with the
least grip, this removes mud and re-
establishes traction.
Simultaneously, the wheel with the
most grip is provided with the most
torque possible.
This mode is active up to a speed of
80 km/h.

This mode allows a small amount of
simultaneous wheel spin on the two
drive wheels, enabling the vehicle to
advance and reduce the risk of
sinking.
This mode is active up to a speed of
120 km/h.

Caution

Do not use the other modes on
sand as the vehicle may become
stuck.

Sport mode adapts the settings of

Adaptive cruise control
Adaptive cruise control is an
enhancement to conventional cruise
control with the additional feature of
maintaining a certain distance behind
the vehicle ahead. It uses radar and
camera sensors to detect the vehicles
ahead. If no vehicle is detected in the
driving path, the adaptive cruise
control will behave like a conventional
cruise control.
Adaptive cruise control automatically
decelerates the vehicle when
approaching a slower moving vehicle.
It then adjusts the vehicle speed to
follow the vehicle ahead at the
selected following distance. The

vehicle speed increases or decreases
to follow the vehicle in front, but will
not exceed the set speed. It may
apply limited braking with activated
brake lights.
If the vehicle in front accelerates or
changes lane, the adaptive cruise
control progressively accelerates
your vehicle to return to the
programmed speed. If the driver
operates a direction indicator to
overtake a slower vehicle, the
adaptive cruise control allows your
vehicle to temporarily approach the
vehicle in front to assist the
overtaking manoeuvre, though never
exceeding the programmed speed.

9 Warning

The complete driver attention is
always required while driving with
adaptive cruise control. The driver
stays fully in control of the vehicle
because the brake pedal, the
accelerator pedal and the cancel
switch have priority over any
adaptive cruise control operation.

Exceeding the set speed
It is always possible to drive faster
than the selected set speed by
depressing the accelerator pedal.
When the accelerator pedal is
released, the vehicle returns to the
desired distance if a slower vehicle is
ahead. Otherwise it returns to the
stored speed.
Once the system is activated,
adaptive cruise control decelerates or
brakes if it detects a vehicle ahead,
which is slower or closer than the
desired following distance.
If the programmed speed setting is
exceeded, the display of the speed
setting disappears and a message
"Cruise control suspended" is
displayed until the accelerator pedal
is released.

9 Warning

Accelerating by the driver
deactivates automatic braking by
the system. This is indicated as a
pop-up warning in the Driver
Information Centre.

Full speed range adaptive cruise
control on vehicles with automatic
transmission
Full speed range adaptive cruise
control will maintain a following
distance behind a detected vehicle
and slow your vehicle to a stop behind
that vehicle.
In case of a brief stop of the vehicle
ahead the adaptive cruise control will
drive off automatically without driver
action. If necessary, press RES/+ or
the accelerator pedal to resume
adaptive cruise control.
If the stopped vehicle ahead was
stopped for a longer time and then
begins to move forward, the green
illuminated vehicle ahead control

indicator A will flash and a warning
chime will sound as a reminder to
check traffic before resuming.
When the vehicle ahead drives away,
press RES+ or the accelerator pedal
to resume adaptive cruise control. If

Driving and operating

168
Pressing ß to activate the speed
limiter deactivates cruise control.
Switching off the ignition cancels any
programmed speed value.
Driver's attention
● Use adaptive cruise control

carefully on bends or mountain
roads, as it can lose the vehicle
ahead and needs time to detect it
again.

● Do not use the system on

slippery roads as it can create
rapid changes in tyre traction
(wheel spinning), so that you
could lose control of the vehicle.

● Do not use adaptive cruise
control during rain, snow or
heavy dirt, as the radar sensor
can be covered by a water film,
dust, ice or snow. This reduces or
suppresses completely the
visibility. In case of sensor
blockage, clean the sensor
cover.

● Do not use the system when the

spare wheel is in use.

System limits

9 Warning

The system's automatic brake
force does not permit hard braking
and the braking level may not be
sufficient to avoid a collision.

● After a sudden lane change, the
system needs a certain time to
detect the next preceding
vehicle. So if a new vehicle is
detected, the system may
accelerate instead of braking.
● Adaptive cruise control does
ignore the oncoming traffic.

● Adaptive cruise control does not

consider pedestrians and
animals for braking and driving
off.

● Adaptive cruise control considers

stopped vehicles only at low
speed.

● Do not use adaptive cruise

control when towing a trailer.

● Do not use adaptive cruise

control on roads with an incline of
more than 10%.

As the radar's field of detection is
quite narrow, it is possible that the
system may not detect:
● Vehicles of reduced width
(motorcycles, scooters...).
● Vehicles not running in the

middle of the lane,

● Vehicles entering a corner.
● Vehicles suddenly pulling out.
Bends

The adaptive cruise control calculates
a predicted path based on the
centrifugal force. This predicted path
considers the current bend
characteristic, but cannot consider a

future bend change. The system may
lose the current vehicle ahead or
consider a vehicle which is not in the
actual lane. This can happen when
entering or exiting a bend or if the
bend gets stronger or weaker. If it no
longer detects any vehicle ahead,
then control indicator A will
extinguish.
If the centrifugal force is too high in a
bend, the system slows down the
vehicle slightly. This braking level is
not designed to avoid spinning-off the
bend. The driver is responsible for
reducing the selected speed before
entering a bend and in general to
adapt the speed to the road type and
to existing speed limits.

control has a limited visibility range, a
limited braking level and a certain
reaction time to verify if a vehicle is on
the driving path or not. Adaptive
cruise control may not be able to
brake the vehicle in time to avoid a
collision with a much slower vehicle or
after a lane change. This is
particularly true while driving fast or if
the visibility is reduced due to weather
conditions.
While entering or exiting a motorway,
adaptive cruise control may lose the
vehicle ahead and accelerate up to
the set speed. For this reason,
decrease the set speed before the
exit or before the entry.
Vehicle path changes

Motorways
On motorways, adapt the set speed
to the situation and the weather.
Always consider that adaptive cruise

If another vehicle enters your driving
path, adaptive cruise control will first
consider the vehicle when it is
completely in your path. Be ready to

169

Driving and operating
take action and depress the brake
pedal, if you need to brake more
quickly.
Hill and trailer considerations

9 Warning

Do not use adaptive cruise control
on steep hill roads.

System performance on hills depends
on vehicle speed, vehicle load, traffic
conditions and the road gradient. It
may not detect a vehicle in your path
while driving on hills. On steep hills,
you may have to use the accelerator
pedal to maintain your vehicle speed.
When going downhill you may have to
brake to maintain or reduce your
speed.
Note that applying the brake
deactivates the system.

Driving and operating

Radar unit

The radar unit is located in the middle
of the front bumper.

9 Warning

The radar unit was aligned
carefully during manufacture.
Therefore, after a frontal accident,
do not use the system. The front
bumper may appear to be intact,
however the sensor behind can be
out of position and react
incorrectly. After an accident,

consult a workshop to verify and
correct the adaptive cruise control
sensor position.

Fault
In the event of a fault with the cruise
control, you are alerted by the
illumination of a warning lamp and the
display of a message in the
instrument panel, accompanied by an
audible signal.
The adaptive cruise control may not
operate correctly if traffic signs do not
comply with the Vienna Convention
on Road Signs and Signals (Wiener
Übereinkommen über
Straßenverkehrszeichen).
Have the system checked by a dealer
or a qualified workshop.
As a safety measure, do not use the
system if the brake lamps are faulty.
Do not use the system if the front
bumper is damaged.

Forward collision alert
The forward collision alert may help to
avoid or reduce the harm caused by
front-end crashes.
The forward collision alert uses the
front camera in the windscreen and a
radar unit located behind the front
bumper of the vehicle to detect a
vehicle directly ahead, in your path.
If a vehicle directly ahead is
approached too quickly, a warning
chime and alert in the Driver
Information Centre is provided.
Activation
Forward collision alert detects
vehicles and operates automatically
at all speeds between 5 km/h and
140 km/h.
Alerting the driver
The system triggers different level of
alerts depending on the risk of
collision detected. The alerts are
displayed in the instrument cluster.
Level 1: A visual alert is displayed.
Level 2: A visual alert is displayed and
an audible alert is triggered.

Caution

The colour lighting of this control
indicator does not correspond to
local traffic laws on following
distance. The driver bears full
responsibility for maintaining safe
following distance according to
applicable traffic rules, weather
and road conditions etc. at all
times.

When the time to a potential collision
with a vehicle in front gets too small
and a collision is imminent, a warning
is displayed in the Driver Information
Centre.
Simultaneously a warning chime
sounds. Depress the brake pedal and
steer the vehicle, if it is required by the
situation.
Selecting the alert sensitivity
7'' Colour-Info-Display: Adjust the
alert sensitivity in the vehicle
personanlisation, 3 106.

8'' Colour-Info-Display: Adjust the
alert sensitivity in the settings of the
active emergency braking in the
vehicle personanlisation, 3 106.
The chosen setting will remain until it
is changed. The alert timing will vary
based on vehicle speed. The faster
the vehicle speed, the farther away
the alert will occur. Consider traffic
and weather conditions when
selecting the alert timing.
Deactivation
The system can only be deactivated
by deactivating the active emergency
braking in the vehicle personalisation,
3 106.
General information

9 Warning

Forward collision alert is just a
warning system and does not
apply the brakes. When
approaching a vehicle ahead too
rapidly, it may not provide you
enough time to avoid a collision.

Driving and operating

171

The driver accepts full
responsibility for the appropriate
following distance based on traffic,
weather and visibility conditions.
The complete attention of the
driver is always required while
driving. The driver must always be
ready to take action and apply the
brakes.

System limitations
Forward collision alert is designed to
warn on vehicles only, but may react
also to other objects.
In the following cases, Forward
collision alert may not detect a vehicle
ahead or sensor performance is
limited:
● Driving on winding or hilly roads.
● During nighttime driving.
● Weather limits visibility, such as

fog, rain, or snow

Driving and operating
172
● The sensor in the windscreen or

the radar unit behind the front
bumper are blocked by snow, ice,
slush, mud, dirt etc.

● The windscreen is damaged or
affected by foreign items, e.g.
stickers.

Active emergency braking
Active emergency braking can help to
reduce the damage and injury from
crashes with vehicles, pedestrians
and obstacles directly ahead, when a
collision can no longer be avoided
either by manual braking or by
steering. Before the active
emergency braking applies, the driver
is warned by the Forward collision
alert 3 170 or the Front pedestrian
protection alert 3 175.
The feature uses various inputs (e.g.
camera sensor, radar sensor, brake
pressure, vehicle speed) to calculate
the probability of a frontal collision.

9 Warning

This system is not intended to
replace the driver responsibility for
driving the vehicle and looking
ahead. Its function is limited to
supplemental use only to reduce
the vehicle speed before a
collision.
The system may not react to
animals. After a sudden lane
change, the system needs a
certain time to detect the next
preceding vehicle.
The driver must always be ready
to take action and apply the brakes
and steer to avoid collisions.

Functionality
If equipped only with front camera the
active emergency braking operates in
forward gear above walking speed up
to 85 km/h. With radar sensor and
front camera active emergency
braking operates in forward gear
above walking speeds to 140 km/h.

A precondition is that forward collision
alert with front camera system is not
deactivated in the vehicle
personalisation menu 3 106.
The system includes:
● brake preparation system
● emergency automatic braking
● forward looking brake assist
● intelligent brake assist (only with

radar sensor)

● forward collision alert
● front pedestrian protection
Brake preparation system
When approaching a vehicle ahead
or a pedestrian so quickly that a
collision is likely, the brake
preparation system slightly
pressurizes the brakes. This reduces
the response time, when a manual or
automatic braking is requested.
The brake system is prepared so that
braking can occur more rapidly.

Emergency automatic braking
After activation of brake preparation
system and just before the imminent
collision, this function automatically
applies limited braking to reduce the
impact speed of the collision or
prohibit a crash. Depending on the
situation, the vehicle may
automatically brake moderately or
hard. This front automatic braking can
only occur if a vehicle ahead is
detected 3 170. On vehicles with front
pedestrian protection, front automatic
braking can also occur when a
pedestrian ahead is detected.
Emergency automatic braking may
slow the vehicle to a complete stop to
try to avoid a potential crash. If this
happens, emergency automatic
braking may engage the electric
parking brake to hold the vehicle at a
stop. To release press the electric
parking brake button or firmly press
the accelerator pedal.

Driving and operating

173

9 Warning

9 Warning

Emergency automatic braking is
an emergency crash preparation
feature and is not designed to
avoid crashes. Do not rely on the
system to brake the vehicle.
Emergency automatic braking will
not brake outside of its operating
speed range and only responds to
detected vehicles and
pedestrians.

Forward looking brake assist
In addition to the brake preparation
system and emergency automatic
braking, the forward looking brake
assist function makes the brake assist
more sensitive. Therefore, pressing
the brake pedal less strongly results
in immediate hard braking. This
function helps the driver brake
quicker and harder before the
imminent collision.

Active emergency braking is not
designed to apply hard
autonomous braking or to
automatically avoid a collision. It is
designed to reduce the vehicle
speed before a collision. It may not
react to animals. After a sudden
lane change, the system needs a
certain time to detect the next
preceding vehicle.
The complete attention of the
driver is always required while
driving. The driver must always be
ready to take action and apply the
brakes and steer to avoid
collisions.

The system is designed to work with
all occupants wearing their seat belts.
Intelligent Brake Assist
If the vehicle is equipped with radar
sensor Intelligent brake assist may
activate when the brake pedal is
applied quickly by providing a boost

Driving and operating

174
to braking based on the speed of
approach and distance to a vehicle
ahead.
Minor brake pedal pulsations or pedal
movement during this time is normal
and the brake pedal should continue
to be applied as needed. Intelligent
brake assist will automatically
disengage only when the brake pedal
is released.

9 Warning

Intelligent brake assist may
increase vehicle braking in
situations when it may not be
necessary. You could block the
flow of traffic. If this occurs, take
your foot off the brake pedal and
then apply the brakes as needed.

Deactivation
Active emergency braking can be
deactivated in the personalisation
menu 3 106. If deactivated a
message is displayed in the Driver
Information Centre.
System limitations
In some cases, the active emergency
braking system may provide an
automatic braking in situations that
seem to be unnecessary, for instance
in parking garages, due to traffic signs
in a curve or due to vehicles in
another lane. This is normal
operation, the vehicle does not need
service. Firmly apply the accelerator
pedal to override the automatic
braking if the situation and the
surroundings permit.
In the following cases, active
emergency braking performance is
limited:
● Driving on winding or hilly roads.
● Detecting all vehicles, especially

vehicles with a trailer, tractors,
muddy vehicles, etc.

● Detecting a vehicle when

weather limits visibility, such as in
fog, rain, or snow.

● During nighttime driving.
● Weather limits visibility, such as

fog, rain, or snow.

● The sensor in the windscreen or

the radar unit behind the front
bumper are blocked by snow, ice,
slush, mud, dirt etc.

● The windscreen is damaged or
affected by foreign items, e.g.
stickers.

Complete attention is always required
while driving, and you should be
ready to take action and apply the
brakes and/or steer the vehicle to
avoid crashes.
Fault
In case the system requires a service,
a message is displayed in the Driver
Information Centre.
If the system does not work as it
should do, vehicle messages are
displayed in the Driver Information
Centre.
Vehicle messages 3 105.

Front pedestrian protection
Front pedestrian protection may help
to avoid or reduce the harm caused
by front-end crashes with nearby
pedestrians when driving in a forward
gear.
The system uses the front camera in
the windscreen and a radar unit in the
front bumper to detect a pedestrian
directly ahead, in your path.
Front pedestrian protection can
detect and alert to pedestrians in a
forward gear at speeds between 5km/
h and 60 km/h. Additionally Front
pedestrian protection can provide a
boost to braking or automatically
brake the vehicle.
During nighttime driving, system
performance is limited.
Front pedestrian protection can be
set to Off, Alert, or Alert & Brake in
vehicle personalisation 3 106.

9 Danger

Front pedestrian braking does not
provide an alert or automatically
brake the vehicle, unless it detects
a pedestrian.
The system may not detect
pedestrians, including children,
when the pedestrian is not directly
ahead, not fully visible, not
standing upright, or when part of a
group.

Front pedestrian protection includes:
● detecting front pedestrian ahead
● front pedestrian alert
Detecting front pedestrian ahead

9 Warning

Under certain circumstances,
various reflective surfaces on
objects or clothing as well as
external noise sources may cause
the system to fail to detect
obstacles.
Special attention must be paid to
low obstacles which can damage
the lower part of the bumper.

Caution

Performance of the system can be
reduced when sensors are
covered, e.g. by ice or snow.

Performance of the parking assist
system can be reduced due to
heavy loading.
Special conditions apply if there
are taller vehicles in the vicinity
(e.g. off-road vehicles, mini vans,
vans). Object identification and
correct distance indication in the
upper part of these vehicles
cannot be guaranteed.
Objects with a very small reflection
cross-section, e.g. objects of
narrow size or soft materials, may
not be detected by the system.
Parking assist systems do not
detect objects outside the
detection range.

Note
It is possible that the sensor detects
a non-existing object caused by
echo disturbance from external
acoustic noise or mechanical
misalignments (sporadic false
warnings may occur).

● Sudden lighting changes.
The system can not operate when no
lane marking is detected.

Lane keep assist
Lane keep assist helps to avoid
crashes due to unintentional lane
departures. The front camera
observes the lane markings between
which the vehicle is driving. If the
vehicle approaches a lane marking,
the steering wheel is gently turned to
position the vehicle back into the lane.
Turn steering wheel in same
direction, if system steers not
sufficient. Turn steering wheel gently
into opposite direction, if lane change
is intended.
When crossing a lane marking
significantly, lane keep assist starts a
visual and acoustic warning.

Driving and operating

192
After ignition is switched on, lane
keep assist is activated. If the system
is activated, the LED in the button Ó
is not illuminated . To activate the
system when the system is
deactivated, press Ó.
When the control indicator a in the
instrument cluster illuminates green,
the system is ready to assist.
The system is operational at vehicle
speeds between 65 km/h and
180 km/h and if lane markings are
available. The driver must hold the
wheel with both hands. The change of
trajectory is not accompanied by
operation of the direction indicators.
The ESC system must be activated.
The system makes the correction to
the trajectory necessary to return the
vehicle to its initial path if it identifies
a risk of the vehicle involuntarily
crossing one of the lane markings
detected. The driver will then notice a
turning movement of the steering
wheel.

The control indicator a flashes
during trajectory correction. In the
Driver Information Centre, the line of
the corrected side will be displayed in
orange.
If the driver wishes to maintain the
trajectory of the vehicle, he can
prevent the correction by keeping a
firm grip on the wheel (during an
avoiding manoeuvre, for example).
The correction is interrupted if the
direction indicators are operated.
While the direction indicators are on
and for a few seconds after switching
them off, the system considers that
any change of trajectory is voluntary
and no correction is triggered during
this period.
If the system detects that the driver is
not holding the wheel firmly enough
during an automatic correction of
trajectory, it interrupts the correction.
An alert is triggered to encourage the
driver to take back control of the
vehicle.

Deactivation
The system is deactivated by
pressing Ó during a few seconds; the
LED in the button illuminates. In the
Driver Information Centre, solid grey
lines are displayed.
Fault
The system performance may be
affected by:
● Windscreen not clean or affected

by foreign items, e.g. stickers

● Close vehicles ahead
● Banked roads
● Winding or hilly roads
● Road edges
● Roads with poor lane markings
● Sudden lighting changes
● Adverse environmental

conditions e.g. heavy rain or
snow

● Vehicle modifications, e.g. tyres.

Switch off the system if the system is
disturbed by tar marks, shadows,
road cracks, temporary or
construction lane markings, or other
road imperfections.

9 Warning

Always keep your attention on the
road and maintain proper vehicle
position within the lane, otherwise
vehicle damage, injury or death
could occur.
Lane keep assist does not
continuously steer the vehicle.
The system may not keep the
vehicle in the lane or give an alert,
even if a lane marking is detected.
The steering of the lane keep
assist may not be sufficient to
avoid a lane departure.
The system may not detect hands-
off driving due to external
influences (road condition and
surface, weather etc). The driver
has full responsibility to control the

vehicle and is always required to
keep the hands on the steering
wheel while driving.
Using the system while towing a
trailer or on slippery roads could
cause loss of control of the vehicle
and a crash. Switch the system off.
Driver alert
The driver alert system monitores the
driving time and the vigilance of the
driver. Monitoring the vigilance of the
driver is based on the trajectory
variations of the vehicle compared to
the lane markings.
The system includes a driving time
alert combined with driver drowsiness
detection.

9 Warning

The system cannot replace the
need for vigilance on the part of
the driver. It is recommended that
you take a break as soon as you
feel tired or at least every two
hours. Do not take the wheel if you
are tired.

Driving time alert
The driver gets notified by a pop-up
reminder symbol € in the Driver
Information Centre simultaneously
with a acoustic alert if the driver has
not taken a break after two hours of
driving at a speed above 65 km/h. The
alert is repeated hourly until the
vehicle is stopped, no matter how
vehicle speed evolves.
The counting of driving time alert is
reset when the ignition has been
switched off for a few minutes.
Driver drowsiness detection
The system monitors the driver's level
of vigilance. A camera at the top of the
windscreen detects variations in
trajectory compared to the lane

Driving and operating
194
markings. This system is particularly
suited to fast roads (speed higher
than 65 km/h).
If the trajectory of the vehicle
suggests a certain level of
drowsiness or inattention by the
driver, the system triggers the first
level of alert. The driver is notified by
a message and an audible signal is
given.
After three first level alerts, the
system triggers a new alert with a
message, accompanied by a more
pronounced audible signal.
In certain driving conditions (poor
road surface or strong winds), the
system may give alerts independent
of the driver's level of vigilance.
The driver drowsiness detection is
reinitialised when the ignition has
been switched off for a few minutes or
the speed remains below 65 km/h for
a few minutes.

System limitations
In the following situations, the system
may not operate properly or even not
operate at all:
● Poor visibility caused by
inadequate lighting of the
roadway, falling snow, heavy
rain, dense fog etc.

● Dazzle caused by headlamps of
an oncoming vehicles, low sun,
reflections on damp roads,
leaving a tunnel, alternating
shade and light etc.

● Windscreen area in front of the
camera covered by dirt, snow,
stickers etc.

● No lane markings detected or
multiple lane markings due to
roadworks

● Close vehicles ahead
● Winding roads or narrow roads

Fuel
Fuel for petrol engines
Only use unleaded fuel that complies
with European standard EN 228 or
E DIN 51626-1 or equivalent.
The engine is capable of running with
fuel that contains up to 10% ethanol
(e.g. named E10).
Use fuel with the recommended
octane rating. A lower octane rating
can reduce engine power and torque
and slightly increases fuel
consumption.

Caution

Do not use fuel or fuel additives
that contain metallic compounds
such as manganese-based
additives. This may cause engine
damage.

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 228 or E DIN 51626-1 or
equivalent can lead to deposits or
engine damage.

Caution

Use of fuel with a lower octane
rating than the lowest possible
rating could lead to uncontrolled
combustion and engine damage.

The engine specific requirements
regarding octane rating are given in
the engine data overview 3 245. A
country-specific label at the fuel filler
flap can supersede the requirement.
Fuel additives outside Europe
Fuel should contain detergent
additives that help prevent engine
and fuel system deposits from
forming. Clean fuel injectors and
intake valves will allow the emission
control system to work properly.

Some fuel does not contain sufficient
quantities of additive to keep fuel
injectors and intake valves clean.
To make up for this lack of
detergency, add Fuel System
Treatment PLUS to the fuel tank at
every engine oil change or every
10,000 km, whichever occurs first. It
is available at your workshop.
Fuels containing oxygenates such as
ethers and ethanol, as well as
reformulated fuel, are available in
some cities. If these fuels comply with
the previously described
specification, then they are
acceptable to use. However, E85
(85% ethanol) and other fuels
containing more than 15% ethanol
must be used only in FlexFuel
vehicles.

Caution

Do not use fuel containing
methanol. It can corrode metal
parts in the fuel system and also
damage plastic and rubber parts.
This damage would not be
covered by the vehicle warranty.

195

Driving and operating
Some fuels, mainly high octane
racing fuels, can contain an octane
enhancing additive called
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese
tricarbonyl (MMT). Do not use fuels or
fuel additives with MMT as they can
reduce spark plug life and affect
emission control system
performance. The malfunction
indicator light Z may turn on 3 96. If
this occurs, seek the assistance of a
workshop.

Fuel for diesel engines
Only use diesel fuel that complies
with EN 590.
In countries outside the European
Union use Euro-Diesel fuel with a
sulfur concentration below 50 ppm.

Caution

Use of fuel that does not comply to
EN 590 or similar can lead to
engine powerloss, increased wear
or engine damage.

Driving and operating
196
Do not use marine diesel oils, heating
oils, Aquazole and similar diesel-
water emulsions. Diesel fuels must
not be diluted with fuels for petrol
engines.
Low temperature operation
At temperatures below 0° C, some
diesel products with biodiesel blends
may clog, freeze or gel, which may
affect the fuel supply system. Starting
and engine operation may not work
properly. Make sure to fill winter
grade diesel fuel at ambient
temperatures below 0°C.
Arctic grade diesel fuel can be used
in extreme cold temperatures below
-20° C. Using this fuel grade in warm
or hot climates is not recommended
and may cause engine stalling, poor
starting or damage on the fuel
injection system.

Refuelling

9 Danger

Before refuelling, switch off
ignition and any external heaters
with combustion chambers.
Follow the operating and safety
instructions of the filling station
when refuelling.

9 Danger

Fuel is flammable and explosive.
No smoking. No naked flames or
sparks.
If you can smell fuel in your
vehicle, have the cause of this
remedied immediately by a
workshop.

Caution

In case of misfuelling, do not
switch on ignition.

Fuel filler flap is located at right rear
side of vehicle.

Fuel filler cap
Only use genuine fuel filler caps.
Diesel-engined vehicles have special
fuel filler caps.

Fuel consumption - CO2-
Emissions
The value of the fuel consumption
(combined) of the model Opel
Grandland X is within a range of 5.5
to 4.3 l/100 km.
Depending on country, the fuel
consumption is displayed in km/l.
The value of the CO2 emission
(combined) is within a range of 127 to
111 g/km.
For the values specific for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.

The fuel filler flap can only be opened
if the vehicle is unlocked. Release the
fuel filler flap by pushing the flap.
Petrol and Diesel refuelling
To open, turn the cap slowly
anticlockwise.

The fuel filler cap can be attached to
the hook on the fuel filler flap.
To refuel, fully insert the pump nozzle
and switch it on.
After the automatic cut-off, the tank
can be topped up by operating the

General information
The official fuel consumption and
specific CO2 emission figures quoted
relate to the EU base model with
standard equipment.
Fuel consumption data and CO2
emission data are determined
according to regulation R (EC) No.
715/2007 (in the version respectively
applicable), taking into consideration
the vehicle weight in running order, as
specified by the regulation.
The figures are provided only for the
purpose of comparison between
different vehicle variants and must
not be taken as a guarantee for the
actual fuel consumption of a
particular vehicle. Additional
equipment may result in higher
results than the stated consumption
and CO2 figures. Furthermore, fuel
consumption is dependent on
personal driving style as well as road
and traffic conditions.

Trailer hitch
General information
Only use towing equipment that has
been approved for your vehicle.
Vehicles with natural gas engines
require special towing equipment.
Entrust retrofitting of towing
equipment to a workshop. It may be
necessary to make changes that
affect the cooling system, heat
shields or other equipment.
The bulb outage detection function for
trailer brake light cannot detect a
partial bulb outage. E.g. in case of
4x 5 Watt bulbs, the function only
detects lamp outage when only a
single 5 Watt lamp remains or none
remain.
Fitting of towing equipment could
cover the opening of the towing eye.
If this is the case use the coupling ball
bar for towing. Always keep the
coupling ball bar in the vehicle.

Driving characteristics and
towing tips
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate
the coupling ball. However, do not do
so if a stabiliser, which acts on the
coupling ball, is being used to reduce
snaking movements.
During trailer towing do not exceed a
speed of 80 km/h. A maximum speed
of 100 km/h is only appropriate if an
oscillation damper is used and the
permissible gross trailer weight does
not exceed the vehicle’s curb weight.
For trailers with low driving stability
and caravan trailers, the use of an
oscillation damper is strongly
recommended.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more
slowly, do not attempt to correct the
steering and brake sharply if
necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the
same gear as if driving uphill and
drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value
specified for full load 3 249.

The permissible gross train weight
must not be exceeded. This weight is
specified on the identification plate
3 240.
Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load
exerted by the trailer on the coupling
ball. It can be varied by changing the
weight distribution when loading the
trailer.
The maximum permissible vertical
coupling load (70 kg) is specified on
the towing equipment identification
plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum load,
especially in the case of heavy
trailers. The vertical coupling load
should never fall below 25 kg.

Driving and operating
Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the
towing vehicle fully loaded, the
permissible rear axle load (see
identification plate or vehicle
documents) may be exceeded by
60 kg, the gross vehicle weight rating
may be exceeded by 60 kg. If the
permissible rear axle load is
exceeded, a maximum speed of
100 km/h applies.

Towing equipment
Caution

When operating without a trailer,
remove the coupling ball bar.

Trailer towing
Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are
vehicle and engine-dependent
maximum values which must not be
exceeded. The actual trailer load is
the difference between the actual
gross weight of the trailer and the
actual coupling socket load with the
trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are
specified in the vehicle documents. In
general, they are valid for gradients
up to 12%.
The permissible trailer load applies
up to the specified incline and at sea
level. Since engine power decreases
as altitude increases due to the air
becoming thinner, therefore reducing
climbing ability, the permissible gross
train weight also decreases by 10%
for every 1000 metres of altitude. The
gross train weight does not have to be
reduced when driving on roads with
slight inclines (less than 8%, e.g.
motorways).

Wheels and tyres

Tyre condition, wheel condition
Drive over edges slowly and at right
angles if possible. Driving over sharp
edges can cause tyre and wheel
damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb
when parking.
Regularly check the wheels for
damage. Seek the assistance of a
workshop in the event of damage or
unusual wear.

Winter tyres
Winter tyres improve driving safety at
temperatures below 7 °C and should
therefore be fitted on all wheels.
In accordance with country-specific
regulations, affix the speed sticker in
the driver's field of view.
All tyre sizes are permitted as winter
tyres 3 249.

Tyre designations
E.g. 225/55 R 18 98 V

W : up to 270 km/h
Choose a tyre appropriate for the
maximum speed of your vehicle.
The maximum speed is achievable at
kerb weight with driver (75 kg) plus
125 kg payload. Optional equipment
could reduce the maximum speed of
the vehicle.
Performance 3 246.

Directional tyres
Directional tyres should be mounted
so that they rotate in the correct
direction. The proper rotation
direction is indicated by a symbol
(e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.

Tyre pressure
Check the pressure of cold tyres at
least every 14 days and before any
long journey. Do not forget the spare
wheel. This also applies to vehicles
with tyre pressure monitoring system.

Tyre pressure 3 249.

The tyre pressure information label
on the left door frame indicates the
original equipment tyres and the
correspondent tyre pressures.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold
tyres. It applies to summer and winter
tyres.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the
pressure specified for full load.
The ECO tyre pressure serves to
achieve the smallest amount of fuel
consumption possible.
Incorrect tyre pressures will impair
safety, vehicle handling, comfort and
fuel economy and will increase tyre
wear.
Tyre pressures differ depending on
various options. For the correct tyre
pressure value, follow the procedure
below:
1. Identify the engine identifier code.

Engine data 3 245.

2. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all
possible tyre combinations 3 249.

For the tyres approved for your
vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of
Conformity provided with your vehicle
or other national registration
documents.
The driver is responsible for correct
adjustment of tyre pressure.

9 Warning

If the pressure is too low, this can
result in considerable tyre warm-
up and internal damage, leading to
tread separation and even to tyre
blow-out at high speeds.

9 Warning

For specific tyres the
recommended tyre pressure as
shown in the tyre pressure table
may exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.
Never exceed the maximum tyre
pressure as indicated on the tyre.

Vehicle care

219

Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the
temperature of the tyre. During
driving, tyre temperature and
pressure increase. Tyre pressure
values provided on the tyre
information label and tyre pressure
chart are valid for cold tyres, which
means at 20 °C.
The pressure increases by nearly
10 kPa for a 10 °C temperature
increase. This must be considered
when warm tyres are checked.
The tyre pressure value displayed in
the Driver Information Centre shows
the real tyre pressure. A cooled down
tyre will show a decreased value,
which does not indicate an air leak.

Tyre deflation detection
system
The tyre deflation detection system
continually checks the rotation speed
of all four wheels and warns on low
tyre pressure condition once vehicle
is driving. This is achieved by
comparing tyre rolling circumference
with reference values.

Vehicle care

220
If a tyre loses pressure the control
indicator w illuminates and a warning
message is displayed in the Driver
Information Centre.
In this case reduce speed, avoid
sharp cornering and strong braking.
Stop at next safe opportunity and
check tyre pressure.
Control indicator w 3 99.
After adjusting tyre pressure initialise
system to extinguish the control
indicator and restart system.

Caution

Deflation detection system warns
just about low tyre pressure
condition and does not replace
regular tyre maintenance by the
driver.

In case of a system malfunction a
message is displayed in the Driver
Information Centre. Set correct tyre
pressure and reinitialise system. If the
failure continues to be displayed,
contact a workshop. The system is
inoperable when ABS or ESC has a
malfunction or a temporary spare

wheel is used. Once the road tyre has
been refitted, check the tyre pressure
with cold tyres and initialise the
system.
System initialisation

After tyre pressure correction or
wheel change, the system must be
initialised to learn new circumference
reference values:
1. Always ensure that all four tyres

have correct tyre pressure
3 249.

2. Apply manual parking brake.

3. Press w to reset deflation

detection system.

4. Reset is confirmed by pop-up

indication.

After initialisation system
automatically calibrates to new tyre
pressures during driving. After longer
drive the system will adopt and
monitor new pressures.
Always check tyre pressure with cold
tyres.
System has to be reinitialised when:
● Tyre pressure has been changed
● Load condition has been

changed

● Wheels have been swapped or

exchanged

The system will not warn
instantaneously on a tyre blow out or
a rapid deflation. This is due to
required calculation time.

Tread depth
Check tread depth at regular
intervals.

Vehicle care

221

9 Warning

The use of unsuitable tyres or
wheels may lead to accidents and
will invalidate the vehicle
operating permit.
Wheel covers
Wheel covers and tyres that are
factory approved for the respective
vehicle and comply with all of the
relevant wheel and tyre combination
requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are
not factory approved, the tyres must
not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake
cooling.

If there is more wear at the front than
the rear, swap round front wheels and
rear wheels periodically. Ensure that
the direction of rotation of the wheels
remains the same.
Tyres age, even if they are not used.
We recommend tyre replacement
every 6 years.

Changing tyre and wheel
size
If tyres of a different size than those
fitted at the factory are used, it may be
necessary to reprogramme the
speedometer as well as the nominal
tyre pressure and make other vehicle
modifications.
After converting to a different tyre
size, have the label with tyre
pressures replaced and the tyre
deflation detection system
reinitialised. 3 219

Tyres should be replaced for safety
reasons at a tread depth of 2-3 mm
(4 mm for winter tyres).
For safety reasons, it is
recommended that the tread depth of
the tyres on one axle should not vary
by more than 2 mm.

The legally permissible minimum
tread depth (1.6 mm) has been
reached when the tread has worn
down as far as one of the tread wear
indicators (TWI). Their position is
indicated by markings on the
sidewall.

222

Vehicle care

9 Warning

Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel
covers could lead to sudden
pressure loss and thereby
accidents.

Vehicles with steel wheels: When
using locking wheel nuts, do not
attach wheel covers.

Tyre chains

Tyre chains are only permitted on the
front wheels.

Always use fine mesh chains that add
no more than 9 mm to the tyre tread
and the inboard sides (including chain
lock).

9 Warning

Damage may lead to tyre blowout.

Tyre chains are permitted on tyres of
size 215/70R16, 215/65 R17,
225/55 R18 and 205/55 R19.
Temporary spare wheel
The use of tyre chains is not permitted
on the temporary spare wheel.

Tyre repair kit
Minor damage to the tyre tread can be
repaired with the tyre repair kit.
Do not remove foreign bodies from
the tyres.
Tyre damage exceeding 4 mm or that
is at tyre's sidewall cannot be repaired
with the tyre repair kit.

9 Warning

Do not drive faster than 80 km/h.
Do not use for a lengthy period.
Steering and handling may be
affected.

If you have a flat tyre:
Apply the parking brake and engage
first gear, reverse gear or P.

10. Set the rocker switch on the

compressor to I. The tyre is filled
with sealant.

11. The compressor pressure gauge
briefly indicates up to 6 bar whilst
the sealant bottle is emptying
(approx. 30 seconds). Then the
pressure starts to drop.

12. All of the sealant is pumped into
the tyre. Then the tyre is being
inflated.

13. The prescribed tyre pressure
should be obtained within ten
minutes.
Tyre pressure 3 249.

When the correct pressure is
obtained, switch off the
compressor.
If the prescribed tyre pressure is
not obtained within ten minutes,
remove the tyre repair kit. Move
the vehicle one tyre rotation.
Reattach the tyre repair kit and
continue the filling procedure for
ten minutes. If the prescribed tyre
pressure is still not obtained, the
tyre is too badly damaged. Seek
the assistance of a workshop.

14. Detach the tyre repair kit. Remove
sealant bottle from bracket. Screw
the filler hose to the free
connection of the sealant bottle.
This prevents sealant from
escaping. Stow tyre repair kit in
load compartment.

15. Remove any excess sealant

using a cloth.

Drain excess tyre pressure with
the button on the air hose.
Do not run the compressor longer
than ten minutes.

16. Continue driving immediately so
that sealant is evenly distributed
in the tyre. After driving approx.
5 km (but no more than ten
minutes), stop and check tyre
pressure. Screw compressor air
hose directly onto tyre valve when
doing this. Fill tyre as described

before. Drain excess tyre
pressure with the button on the air
hose.
If tyre pressure hasn't decreased
under 1.5 bar, set it to the correct
value. Otherwise the vehicle must
not be used. Seek assistance of a
workshop.3 249
Repeat the checking procedure
once more after driving further
10 km (but no more than ten
minutes) to check that there is no
more loss of pressure
If the tyre pressure has fallen
below 1.5 bar, the vehicle must
not be used. Seek the assistance
of a workshop.

17. Stow away tyre repair kit in load

compartment.

Note
The driving characteristics of the
repaired tyre are severely affected,
therefore have this tyre replaced.
If unusual noise is heard or the
compressor becomes hot, turn
compressor off for at least
30 minutes.

The built-in safety valve opens at a
pressure of seven bar.
Note the expiry date of the kit. After
this date its sealing capability is no
longer guaranteed. Pay attention to
storage information on sealant
bottle.
Replace the used sealant bottle.
Dispose of the bottle as prescribed
by applicable laws.
The compressor and sealant can be
used from approx. -30 °C.

Appearance care
Exterior care
Locks
The locks are lubricated at the factory
using a high quality lock cylinder
grease. Use a de-icing agent only
when absolutely necessary, as this
has a degreasing effect and impairs
lock function. After using a de-icing
agent, have the locks regreased by a
workshop.
Washing
The paintwork of your vehicle is
exposed to environmental influences.
Wash and wax your vehicle regularly.
When using automatic vehicle
washes, select a programme that
includes waxing.
Bird droppings, dead insects, resin,
pollen and the like should be cleaned
off immediately, as they contain
aggressive constituents which can
cause paint damage.

If using a vehicle wash, comply with
the vehicle wash manufacturer's
instructions. The windscreen wiper
and rear window wiper must be
switched off. Remove antenna and
external accessories such as roof
racks etc.
If you wash your vehicle by hand,
make sure that the insides of the
wheel housings are also thoroughly
rinsed out.
Wax painted parts of the vehicle
regularly.
Clean edges and folds on opened
doors and the bonnet as well as the
areas they cover.
Clean bright metal mouldings with a
cleaning solution approved for
aluminium to avoid damages.

Caution

Always use a cleaning agent with
a pH value of four to nine.
Do not use cleaning agents on hot
surfaces.

Do not clean the engine compartment
with a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.
Thoroughly rinse and leather-off the
vehicle. Rinse leather frequently. Use
separate leathers for painted and
glass surfaces: remnants of wax on
the windows will impair vision.
Have the door hinges of all doors
greased by a workshop.
Do not use hard objects to remove
spots of tar. Use tar removal spray on
painted surfaces.
Exterior lights
Headlight and other light covers are
made of plastic. Do not use any
abrasive or caustic agents, do not use
an ice scraper, and do not clean them
dry.
Polishing and waxing
Wax the vehicle regularly (at the
latest when water no longer beads).
Otherwise, the paintwork will dry out.
Polishing is necessary only if the paint
has become dull or if solid deposits
have become attached to it.

Paintwork polish with silicone forms a
protective film, making waxing
unnecessary.
Plastic body parts must not be treated
with wax or polishing agents.
Windows and windscreen wiper
blades
Use a soft lint-free cloth or chamois
leather together with window cleaner
and insect remover.
When cleaning the rear window from
inside, always wipe in parallel to the
heating element to prevent damage.
For mechanical removal of ice, use a
sharp-edged ice scraper. Press the
scraper firmly against the glass so
that no dirt can get under it and
scratch the glass.
Clean smearing wiper blades with a
soft cloth and window cleaner.
Remove dirt residues from smearing
wiper blades by using a soft cloth and
window cleaner. Also make sure to
remove any residues such as wax,
insect residues and similar from the
window.

Vehicle care

233
Ice residues, pollution and continuous
wiping on dry windows will damage or
even destroy the wiper blades.
Glass panel
Never clean with solvents or abrasive
agents, fuels, aggressive media
(e.g. paint cleaner, acetone-
containing solutions etc.), acidic or
highly alkaline media or abrasive
pads.
Wheels and tyres
Do not use high-pressure jet
cleaners.
Clean rims with a pH-neutral wheel
cleaner.
Rims are painted and can be treated
with the same agents as the body.
Paintwork damage
Rectify minor paintwork damage with
a touch-up pen before rust forms.
Have more extensive damage or rust
areas repaired by a workshop.

Vehicle care

234
Underbody
Some areas of the vehicle underbody
have a PVC undercoating while other
critical areas have a durable
protective wax coating.
After the underbody is washed, check
the underbody and have it waxed if
necessary.
Bitumen/rubber materials could
damage the PVC coating. Have
underbody work carried out by a
workshop.
Before and after winter, wash the
underbody and have the protective
wax coating checked.
Liquid gas system

9 Danger

Liquid gas is heavier than air and
can collect in sink points.
Take care when performing work
at the underbody in a pit.

For painting work and when using a
drying booth at a temperature above
60 °C, the liquid gas tank must be
removed.
Do not make any modifications to the
liquid gas system.
Towing equipment
Do not clean the coupling ball bar with
a steam-jet or high-pressure jet
cleaner.

Interior care
Interior and upholstery
Only clean the vehicle interior,
including the instrument panel fascia
and panelling, with a dry cloth or
interior cleaner.
Clean the leather upholstery with
clear water and a soft cloth. In case of
heavy soiling, use leather care.
The instrument cluster and the
displays should only be cleaned using
a soft damp cloth. If necessary use a
weak soap solution.

Clean fabric upholstery with a
vacuum cleaner and brush. Remove
stains with an upholstery cleaner.
Clothing fabrics may not be
colourfast. This could cause visible
discolourations, especially on light-
coloured upholstery. Removable
stains and discolourations should be
cleaned as soon as possible.
Clean seat belts with lukewarm water
or interior cleaner.

Caution

Close Velcro fasteners as open
Velcro fasteners on clothing could
damage seat upholstery.
The same applies to clothing with
sharp-edged objects, like zips or
belts or studded jeans.

Plastic and rubber parts
Plastic and rubber parts can be
cleaned with the same cleaner as
used to clean the body. Use interior
cleaner if necessary. Do not use any
other agent. Avoid solvents and petrol
in particular. Do not use high-
pressure jet cleaners.

9 Warning

Operating materials are
hazardous and could be
poisonous. Handle with care. Pay
attention to information given on
the containers.

Engine oil
Engine oil is identified by its quality
and its viscosity. Quality is more
important than viscosity when
selecting which engine oil to use. The
oil quality ensures e.g. engine
cleanliness, wear protection and oil
aging control, whereas viscosity
grade gives information on the oil's
thickness over a temperature range.

Service and maintenance

238
Dexos is the newest engine oil quality
that provides optimum protection for
petrol and diesel engines. If it is
unavailable, engine oils of other listed
qualities must be used.
Recommendations for petrol engines
are also valid for Compressed Natural
Gas (CNG), Liquified Petroleum Gas
(LPG) and Ethanol (E85) fuelled
engines.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 242.
Topping up engine oil

Caution

In case of any spilled oil, wipe it up
and dispose it properly.

Engine oils of different manufacturers
and brands can be mixed as long as
they comply with the required engine
oil quality and viscosity.

Use of engine oils for all petrol
engines with only ACEA quality is
prohibited, since it can cause engine
damage under certain operating
conditions.
Select the appropriate engine oil
based on its quality and on the
minimum ambient temperature
3 242.
Additional engine oil additives
The use of additional engine oil
additives could cause damage and
invalidate the warranty.
Engine oil viscosity grades
The SAE viscosity grade gives
information of the thickness of the oil.
Multigrade oil is indicated by two
figures, e.g. SAE 5W-30. The first
figure, followed by a W, indicates the
low temperature viscosity and the
second figure the high temperature
viscosity.
Select the appropriate viscosity grade
depending on the minimum ambient
temperature 3 242.

All of the recommended viscosity
grades are suitable for high ambient
temperatures.
Coolant and antifreeze
Use only organic acid type-long life
coolant (LLC) antifreeze approved for
the vehicle. Consult a workshop.
The system is factory filled with
coolant designed for excellent
corrosion protection and frost
protection down to approx. -28 °C. In
cold regions with very low
temperatures the factory filled coolant
provides frost protection down to
approx. -37 °C. This concentration
should be maintained all year round.
The use of additional coolant
additives that intend to give additional
corrosion protection or seal against
minor leaks can cause function
problems. Liability for consequences
resulting from the use of additional
coolant additives will be rejected.

Service and maintenance

239

Washer fluid
Use only washer fluid approved for
the vehicle to prevent damage of
wiper blades, paintwork, plastic and
rubber parts. Consult a workshop.
Brake and clutch fluid
Over time, brake fluid absorbs
moisture which will reduce braking
effectiveness. The brake fluid should
therefore be replaced at the specified
interval.
AdBlue
Only use AdBlue to reduce the
nitrogen oxides in the exhaust
emission 3 145.

Collision damage repair
Paint thickness
Due to production techniques, the
thickness of the paint can vary
between 50 and 400 µm.
Therefore, different paint thickness is
no indicator for a collision damage
repair.

Vehicle data recording
and privacy
Event data recorders
Data storage modules in the
vehicle
A large number of electronic
components of your vehicle contain
data storage modules temporarily or
permanently storing technical data
about the condition of the vehicle,
events and errors. In general, this
technical information documents the
condition of parts, modules, systems
or the environment:
● operating conditions of system
components (e.g. filling levels)
● status messages of the vehicle
and its single components (e.g.
number of wheel revolutions /
rotational speed, deceleration,
lateral acceleration)

● dysfunctions and defects in

important system components

Customer information

256
● vehicle reactions in particular

driving situations (e.g. inflation of
an airbag, activation of the
stability regulation system)

● environmental conditions (e.g.

temperature)

These data are exclusively technical
and help identifying and correcting
errors as well as optimising vehicle
functions.
Motion profiles indicating travelled
routes cannot be created with these
data.
If services are used (e.g. repair
works, service processes, warranty
cases, quality assurance),
employees of the service network
(manufacturer included) are able to
read out this technical information
from the event and error data storage
modules applying special diagnostic
devices. If required, you will receive
further information at these
workshops. After an error has been
corrected, the data are deleted from
the error storage module or they are
constantly overwritten.

When using the vehicle, situations
may occur in which these technical
data related to other information
(accident report, damages on the
vehicle, witness statements etc.) may
be associated with a specific person -
possibly, with the assistance of an
expert.
Additional functions contractually
agreed upon with the client (e.g.
vehicle location in emergency cases)
allow the transmission of particular
vehicle data from the vehicle.

Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID)
RFID technology is used in some
vehicles for functions such as tyre
pressure monitoring and ignition
system security. It is also used in
connection with conveniences such
as radio remote controls for door
locking/unlocking and starting, and in-
vehicle transmitters for garage door
openers. RFID technology in Opel
vehicles does not use or record
personal information or link with any
other Opel system containing
personal information.
